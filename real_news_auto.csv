Watch: Is the US heading into a recession? Three warning signs to watch

Donald Trump says Chinese-made smartphones and other electronics will not be exempt from tariffs - adding they are simply moving into a different levy ""bucket"". European stock markets bounced up on Monday morning after Friday's official announcement that some of these products would escape levies of up to 145%. China has called on Donald Trump to ""completely cancel"" his tariffs regime, and ""return to the right path of mutual respect"". However US officials said on Sunday that products would be subject to a ""semiconductor tariff"" instead, with Trump expected to reveal more details later.

US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the new levy would be in addition to a host of global tariffs the US imposed earlier this month, then paused for 90 days. ""We need our medicines and we need semiconductors and our electronics to be built in America,"" he added. On Saturday, a US customs notice revealed smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices would be excluded from the 125% tariff on goods entering the country from China. But Trump chimed in on social media, saying there was no exemption for these products and called such reports about this notice false. Instead, he said that ""they are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket'"". Trump added: ""We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations."" He said he would provide an update on Monday about semiconductor duties. Everyday devices such as smartphones and laptops rely on semiconductors, which are small and powerful pieces of tech that form the basic building blocks of modern computation. Trump's iPhone olive branch is a significant trade war retreat

Trump's changing tariffs leave shoppers feeling paralysed On Monday, Sony announced that it was increasing the price of its flagship games console, the PlayStation 5, by about 10% in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, citing a ""challenging economic environment"", inflation and fluctuating exchange rates. It did not announce price rises in the United States. The Chinese commerce ministry had called Trump's exemptions a ""small step"" by the US, and said that Beijing was ""evaluating the impact"" of the move. But the suggestion by Trump administration officials of plans for future levies may dampen hopes of a thaw in the two rivals' protectionist posture. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer was asked on Sunday whether there were any plans for Trump to speak with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. ""Right now we don't have any plans on that,"" he said during an appearance on CBS's Face the Nation. Trump imposed a tariff amounting to 54% on imports of products from China at the beginning of April, before escalating to the current 145% rate.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62z54gwd22o,1

Watch: BBC on the scene of Russian missile attack in Sumy

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has invited Donald Trump to visit his country ahead of any deal with Russia to end the war. ""Please, before any kind of decisions, any kind of forms of negotiations, come to see people, civilians, warriors, hospitals, churches, children destroyed or dead,"" Zelensky said in an interview for CBS's 60 Minutes programme. The interview was recorded before a Russian missile hit the city of Sumy, killing 34 people and injuring 117 others. Russia said it only strikes military or military-related targets while Trump said he had been told it was a mistake, without specifying who told him.

Germany's chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, has accused Russia of a war crime. The attack comes as the US, Ukraine's strongest military ally, has been pursuing an end to the war - now in its fourth year - through negotiation under Trump. Asked about the attack, the US president said it was ""terrible"" and that he had been ""told they made a mistake"", but did not elaborate. Earlier, Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, retired Lt-Gen Keith Kellogg, said the attack had crossed ""any line of decency"". However, it remains to be seen if Trump will accept Zelensky's invitation. Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, is the only senior member of Trump's team to visit Kyiv, and that was to demand Zelensky sign a contract heavily weighted in Washington's favour to trade Ukraine's mineral wealth for continued military aid. Zelensky refused. The Ukrainian president has highlighted Russia's continued attacks on civilians while Trump attempts to improve relations with Moscow in search of a ceasefire. US special envoy Steve Witkoff has already held three meetings with Vladimir Putin, and Kyiv is adamant Moscow will exploit this as it continues to erode Ukraine's territory. European leaders condemned the Sumy attack. Merz, who is expected to take over as Germany's new chancellor next month, told the country's public broadcaster ARD that the attack constituted a ""serious war crime"". ""It was a perfidious act.. and it is a serious war crime, deliberate and intended,"" the conservative politician said. Germany's outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, meanwhile, said the attack showed ""just what Russia's supposed readiness for peace [was] worth"". French President Emmanuel Macron accused Russia of ""blatant disregard of human lives, international law, and the diplomatic efforts of President Trump"". ""Strong measures are needed to impose a ceasefire on Russia,"" he said. ""France is working tirelessly toward this goal, alongside its partners."" Describing the attack as ""barbaric"", European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen added: ""Russia was and remains the aggressor, in blatant violation of international law. ""Strong measures are urgently needed to enforce a ceasefire. Europe will continue to reach out to partners and maintain strong pressure on Russia until the bloodshed ends and a just and lasting peace is achieved, on Ukraine's terms and conditions."" British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer also gave a view, saying he was ""appalled at Russia's horrific attacks on civilians in Sumy"".

A spokesperson for UN Secretary-General António Guterres said he was ""deeply alarmed and shocked"" to learn of the missile attack. ""Attacks against civilians and civilian objects are prohibited under international humanitarian law, and that any such attacks, wherever they occur, must end immediately"", he added. Guterres stressed the UN's support for ""meaningful efforts towards a just, lasting and comprehensive peace that fully upholds Ukraine's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity"". Sunday's double missile strike was the deadliest attack on civilians in Ukraine this year. Another Russian missile attack, earlier this month on 4 April, killed 20 people and injured 61 in the city of Kryvyi Rih. On that occasion, Russia's defence ministry said it had targeted a meeting of ""unit commanders and Western instructors"" in a restaurant. No evidence was provided. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people - the vast majority of them soldiers - have been killed or injured on all sides since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. The UN estimates that nearly seven million Ukrainians are currently living as refugees. The conflict goes back more than a decade, to 2014, when Ukraine's pro-Russian president was overthrown. Russia then annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and backed insurgents in bloody fighting in eastern Ukraine.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r5vlwj4dqo,1
Daniel Noboa: Centre-right leader wins re-election in Ecuador,"Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa wins re-election

Watch: Daniel Noboa declares re-election ""historic"" while opponent calls for a recount

Sitting centre-right President Daniel Noboa has won the run-off round of Ecuador's presidential election, meaning he will now serve a full four-year term. Noboa, who described his victory as ""historic"", has only been in power since November 2023 after winning a snap election. He has defined his presidency, so far, through a tough military crackdown on violent criminal gangs in the country, which has become the most violent in the region. His left-wing challenger, Luisa González, said she did not accept the result and claimed fraud, without providing evidence.

Reuters Luisa González addressed supporters in Quito on election night

According to figures from Ecuador's national electoral council, this is a decisive win for Noboa - with about 56% of the vote - after polls before the election suggested it was neck and neck. ""A victory of more than ten points and over 1 million votes, leaving no doubt as to who the winner is,"" he said after the result was announced. ""This has been achieved through the perseverance, the struggle, and the hard work of every member of this team,"" he added. Noboa's win means he has a mandate to continue his self-described ""war"" on criminal drug gangs, which has included militarising Ecuador's streets and prisons, and constructing new maximum-security prisons. He recently told the BBC he wanted foreign armies from places such as the US and Europe to join his fight against gangs in the country. He is hoping to change the constitution to allow foreign military bases in the country again, which were banned under the presidency of Rafael Correa - the mentor of González.

Homicides have fallen slightly during Noboa's tenure but violence remains very high. This January, more than 780 people were murdered in the country, making it one of Ecuador's bloodiest months on record. Polls before the election suggested that security was the top concern for voters. Noboa's challenge now is to prove to the country that his plan is working if he wants to avoid unrest and discontent. This means there will be pressure on him to show that violent crime is going down, as well as unemployment. Noboa's ratings fell last year, in particular after widespread drought caused extreme power cuts across the country. He has proposed investing more money in renewable energy to diversify the country's energy supply, the majority of which currently comes from hydropower. He has also signalled a desire to boost relations with the US and President Donald Trump. In February, he announced 27% tariffs on Mexican imports and also repealed his presidential decree that had granted amnesty to undocumented Venezuelan migrants in the country. His campaign was notable for its focus on young people - he is 37 - with a strong emphasis on job creation and slick social media videos. He also pledged to invest in infrastructure in the country and tackle corruption. After her defeat, González accused the electoral authorities of trampling on democracy, and demanded a recount. She would need to provide evidence of her claims for this to happen.

Red Cross says missing Gaza paramedic being detained by Israel,"Gaza medic missing since deadly attack being detained by Israel, Red Cross says

PRCS The Palestinian Red Crescent said Assad al-Nassasra ""forcibly abducted"" by Israeli troops last month and demanded his release

A Palestinian paramedic who has been missing since an Israeli attack that killed 15 other emergency workers in southern Gaza three weeks ago is being detained by Israeli authorities, the International Committee of the Red Cross has said. The ICRC confirmed in a statement that it had ""received information"" that Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) medic Assad al-Nassasra was being held ""in an Israeli place of detention"". The PRCS said Mr Nassasra was ""forcibly abducted"" by Israeli troops following the attack and called for his immediate release. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has not confirmed his detention. A spokesperson said it was aware of the claim about his whereabouts.

The bodies of eight PRCS medics, six Civil Defence first responders and a UN staff member were found buried in shallow graves on the outskirts of Rafah, a week after their convoy came under fire from Israeli troops there on 23 March. One other PRCS medic survived and said he was released by Israeli forces after being detained for around 15 hours. The PRCS has said the incident was a ""full-fledged war crime"", accusing Israeli forces of ""a series of deliberate attacks"" on its staff and their ambulances as they answered a call to help casualties. It has called for an independent international investigation into the incident and for those responsible to be held to account. Last Monday, the IDF said a preliminary inquiry indicated troops ""opened fire due to a perceived threat following a previous encounter in the area, and that six of the individuals killed in the incident were identified as Hamas terrorists"", without giving evidence. The Palestinian Red Crescent rejected the allegation, as did the other surviving paramedic. The IDF initially said its troops fired on ""suspicious vehicles"" driving in darkness with their headlights and emergency lights off. But it later said that account was ""mistaken"" after a video found on the mobile phone of medic Rifaat Radwan, who was in the same ambulance as Assad al-Nassasra, showed the convoy was using its emergency lights. At the end of the video, the ambulances are seen pulled over on the roadside. The sound of gunfire can be then heard just as Radwan gets out of his ambulance. It continues for more than five minutes and Radwan is heard saying his last prayers, before the voices of Israeli soldiers are heard approaching. Audio analysis by BBC Verify of the footage found Israeli troops fired more than 100 times during the attack, with some shots taken from as close as 12m (39ft) away.

Algeria to expel 12 officials from French embassy,"Algeria to expel 12 French embassy officials

The latest rift comes days after tentative steps had been made to mend relations

Barrot urged Algeria to ""abandon"" the expulsions and said France was ready to ""respond immediately"" if they went ahead.

They are accused of involvement in the abduction last year of Amir Boukhors, 41, an outspoken critic of Algeria's government who has an audience of more than one million people online. He had reportedly been granted asylum in France in 2023.

Jean-Noël Barrot added that it was linked to the indictment of three Algerians in France on Friday, one of whom is a consular official.

Algeria has asked 12 French embassy staff to leave the country within 48 hours, France's foreign minister has said.

Boukhors, also known as Amir DZ, has lived in France since 2016.

He was abducted in April 2024 in the southern suburbs of Paris and released the following day, according to his lawyer Eric Plouvier.

Plouvier told the AFP news agency that Boukhors had been ""the subject of two serious attacks, one in 2022 and another on the evening of April 29 2024"".

French media reported that he was forced into a car with a flashing light by ""fake police officers"", then released the next day in woodland without explanation.

Algerian authorities accuse the influencer of being ""a saboteur linked to terrorist groups"". The North African nation has issued nine international arrest warrants against him, accusing him of fraud and associations with terrorist organisations.

He denies the allegations. In 2022, the French courts refused attempts to extradite him to Algeria.

The case is the latest in a growing number of incidents to have exacerbated a rift between France and Algeria.

They include the arrest and imprisonment in Algeria of French-Algerian author Boualem Sansal, who was accused of undermining Algeria's territorial integrity.

Algeria recalled its ambassador from Paris last year after France backed Morocco's claim to the disputed territory of Western Sahara.

The 12 French officials asked to leave on Monday include some members of the French interior ministry, a diplomatic source told AFP.

On Monday, Barrot said: ""I am asking Algerian authorities to abandon these expulsion measures... if the decision to send back our officials is maintained, we will have no other choice but to respond immediately.""

Barrot claimed that the expulsions were a response to the indictment of three Algerian nationals on Friday in Paris - including the consular official - on charges including abduction, arbitrary detention and illegal confinement and participating in a terrorist organisation.

Algeria's foreign ministry said it had summoned French ambassador Stéphane Romatet in response to ""express its strong protest"" and called for the official's immediate release, according to the official Algerian news agency.

It added that the individual ""was arrested in public and then taken into custody without notification through the diplomatic channels"".

The ministry claimed the move was ""not a coincidence as it happens in a very specific context with the aim of stymying the process of relaunching bilateral relations"".

Tentative steps have been made to repair relations between the two nations with a phone call between French President Emmanuel Macron and President Abdelmadjid Tebboune taking place in March.

""The two presidents had a long, frank and friendly exchange on the state of bilateral relations and the tensions that have built up in recent months,"" a joint statement read.

Following an official visit to Algeria on 6 April where he met with Tebboune, Barrot said he hoped for a ""new phase"" in relations.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62xw575w9yo,1
Karenna Groff and family killed in New York plane crash,"Top former college athlete among six dead in New York plane crash

Former Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) athlete Karenna Groff was killed in the crash alongside her parents and partner, according to a family statement

A video of the final seconds of the flight obtained by officials showed the aircraft intact before it crashed into the ground at a high rate of descent, the NTSB said.

The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said the family had been travelling for a holiday celebration when the crash happened.

Among those on board were celebrated former Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) football player Karenna Groff, her parents and her brother, according to a family statement.

A private plane carrying six people crashed in an open field in upstate New York on Saturday, killing all on board, authorities say.

A joint family statement identified the victims as Karenna Groff, her parents Dr Michael Groff and Dr Joy Saini, her brother Jared Groff and his partner Alexia Couyutas Duarte, and Karenna's partner James Santoro.

""They were a wonderful family,"" James's father, John Santoro, told the Associated Press.

""The world lost a lot of very good people who were going to do a lot of good for the world if they had the opportunity. We're all personally devastated.""

Karenna, a former athlete, was named Woman of the Year by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in 2022, her senior year.

She had graduated from MIT, where she met James, and was enrolled in medical school at the New York University (NYU), the family said.

Her parents were both prominent doctors, while her brother, Jared, worked as a paralegal and his partner, Alexia, was about to join Harvard Law School.

""Karenna demonstrated exceptional skill and unwavering passion towards the care of patients and the mission of our institution. We will remember her for her warmth, her grace, her kindness, her outstanding accomplishments, and the pure joy she brought to our community,"" an NYU spokesperson said.

A New York Times article identified the plane's pilot as Karenna's father, Dr Groff, who was ""experienced"" according to a family statement. The report that he was flying the crashed plane has not been publicly confirmed by the family or the authorities.

Speaking at a press conference on Sunday, NTSB official Todd Inman said the twin-engine Mitsubishi MU-2B was ""compressed, buckled and embedded in the terrain"" of a muddy agricultural field near Craryville, New York.

The crash happened at about midday as the family were headed to Columbia County Airport.

Mr Inman added that air traffic control attempted to contact the pilot several times but received no response or distress call.

The pilot had been flying under instrument flight rules, rather than visual flight rules, he said, adding that it was too soon to determine if reduced visibility from weather conditions were a factor.

Mr Inman said the plane had an upgraded cockpit with newer technology, certified to Federal Aviation Administration standards.

An investigation is under way and a probable cause of the crash will be determined in the NTSB's final report in 12 to 24 months' time.

This comes just days after six people, including a family of Spanish tourists, died in a helicopter crash in New York.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg7p52xd5po,1

Footage shows damage at Gaza City hospital site

An Israeli air strike has destroyed part of al Ahli Arab Hospital, the last fully functional hospital in Gaza City. Witnesses said the strike destroyed the intensive care and surgery departments of the hospital. Video posted online appeared to show huge flames and smoke rising after missiles hit a two-storey building. People, including some patients still in hospital beds, were filmed rushing away from the site. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it targeted the hospital because it contained a ""command and control centre used by Hamas"". No casualties were reported, according to Gaza's civil emergency service.

However, one child, who previously suffered a head injury, died as a result of ""the rushed evacuation process"", according to a statement from the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem, part of the Anglican Church, which runs the hospital. Surrounding buildings, including St Philip's church, were also damaged, the diocese said. It added that it was ""appalled"" at the bombing of the hospital ""on the morning of Palm Sunday and the beginning of Holy Week"". Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said al Ahli Arab Hospital's building was ""completely destroyed"", leading to the ""forced displacement of patients and hospital staff"". The IDF said it had taken steps ""to mitigate harm to civilians or to the hospital compound, including issuing advanced warnings in the area of the terror infrastructure, the use of precise munitions, and aerial surveillance"". A local journalist, who was working at the hospital, said the IDF had phoned a doctor who was operating in the emergency department and asked them to evacuate the hospital immediately. ""All patients and displaced people must go out to a safe distance,"" the officer reportedly said. ""You have only 20 minutes to leave."" Footage on social media showed staff and patients leaving the building while it was still dark outside. Dozens of Palestinians, including women and children, were also seen fleeing from a courtyard inside the hospital where they had been seeking shelter. Khalil Bakr told BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme that he and his three injured daughters had fled the hospital with only a couple of minutes to spare before it was bombed. ""It was terrifying,"" he said. ""The whole situation was difficult because I have already been injured. And as for my three daughters, one had her leg amputated, the other had her hand amputated, and the third had her body full of platinum plates."" He added: ""Only two minutes separated us from death.""

EPA Part of the hospital was reduced to rubble by the strike

Al Ahli Arab - a small medical facility before the war - was the only fully functional hospital in Gaza City, following the destruction of Al-Shifa medical complex and other hospitals in the northern part of the Strip. World Health Organization director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the hospital was out of service following the evacuation order and attack, according to an update he received from the hospital's director. Dr Ghebreyesus highlighted how a child had died after a disruption to care, and said the hospital had been forced to move 50 patients to other hospitals, but was unable to move 40 critical patients and could not receive new patients until repairs are carried out. ""Hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law. Attacks on health care must stop,"" he stated. In its statement, the Hamas-run government media office condemned the attack. Israel was ""committing a horrific crime by targeting al Ahli Arab, which houses hundreds of patients and medical staff"", it said. UK Foreign Minister David Lammy said such ""deplorable attacks must end"", adding: ""Israel's attacks on medical facilities have comprehensively degraded access to healthcare in Gaza."" The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell said in a statement: ""For the only Christian hospital in Gaza to be attacked on Palm Sunday is especially appalling. ""I share in the grief of our Palestinian brothers and sisters in the Diocese of Jerusalem. I pray for the staff and patients of the hospital, and for the family of the boy who tragically died during the evacuation."" In October 2023, an explosion at the same hospital killed hundreds of people. Palestinian officials blamed an Israeli strike for the blast.

Aimee Lou Wood calls SNL White Lotus sketch 'mean and unfunny',"Aimee Lou Wood calls SNL parody 'mean and unfunny'

Aimee Lou Wood suggested her portrayal on the sketch show was misogynistic

Wood, 31, said she had received ""apologies from SNL"" after sharing her criticism. The BBC has contacted broadcaster NBC for a response.

In a series of Instagram posts, Wood wrote that she was happy to be made fun of ""when it's clever and in good spirits"" but that there ""must be a cleverer, more nuanced, less cheap way"".

The British actress said the US comedy programme ""punched down"" on her and suggested the sketch was misogynistic.

The White Lotus star Aimee Lou Wood has called a Saturday Night Live (SNL) sketch that impersonated her using exaggerated prosthetic teeth ""mean and unfunny"".

The actress's role in the third series of The White Lotus, which follows a group of guests at a resort, prompted significant media attention surrounding what she calls her ""big gap teeth"".

The SNL sketch, which aired this week, imagined US President Donald Trump and his top team spending time at the fictional hotel.

Wood's character Chelsea was portrayed by cast member Sarah Sherman using a pronounced accent and fake teeth.

At one point, in a reference to the actress's teeth, she asks: ""Fluoride? What's that?""

Wood, who burst onto screens in Netflix's Sex Education, said she was ""not thin skinned"" and understood that SNL was about ""caricature"".

""But the whole joke was about fluoride,"" she wrote on Sunday.

""I have big gap teeth not bad teeth.""

""The rest of the skit was punching up,"" Wood added, ""and I/Chelsea was the only one punched down on"".

She said that she was not ""hating on"" Sarah Sherman, but ""hating on the concept"".

Wood also shared a comment by an unnamed user describing the sketch as ""sharp and funny"" before taking ""a screeching turn into 1970s misogyny"".

""This sums up my view,"" the actress added.

She also criticised Sherman's accent, writing: ""I respect accuracy even if it's mean.""

Wood, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, wrote that she had received ""thousands of messages"" agreeing with her since sharing her posts, and that she was glad she ""said something"".

Speaking to GQ magazine last week, Wood said that the conversation surrounding her teeth made her ""a bit sad because I'm not getting to talk about my work"".

""It makes me really happy that it's symbolising rebellion and freedom, but there's a limit,"" she said.

Wood added: ""I don't know if it was a man would we be talking about it this much? It's still going on about a woman's appearance.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yr7yy40j3o,1
Meta's antitrust trial could force Zuckerberg to sell Instagram,"Landmark antitrust trial could force Zuckerberg to sell Instagram

15 hours ago Share Save Lily Jamali • @lilyjamali North America technology correspondent Reporting from San Francisco Share Save

Reuters

A trial in the landmark antitrust case against social media giant Meta kicks off in Washington on Monday. The US competition and consumer watchdog alleges that Meta, which already owned Facebook, bought Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 to eliminate competition, effectively giving itself a monopoly. The FTC reviewed and approved those acquisitions but committed to monitor the outcomes. If the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) wins the case it could force Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to sell off both Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta previously said it was sure it would win and experts have told the BBC it is likely to argue that Instagram users have had a better experience since it was taken over.

""The [FTC's] argument is the acquisition of Instagram was a way of neutralizing this rising competitive threat to Facebook,"" says Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor of antitrust at Vanderbilt Law School. Ms Allensworth says Mr Zuckerberg's own words, including those from his emails, may offer the most convincing evidence at trial. ""He said it's better to buy than to compete. It's hard to get more literal than that,"" Ms Allensworth says. Meta, on the other hand, is likely to argue that intent is not particularly relevant in an antitrust case. ""They're going to say the real question is: are consumers better off as a result of this merger?,"" she said. ""They'll put on a lot of evidence that Instagram became what it is today because it benefited from being owned by Facebook."" Mr Zuckerberg and the company's former chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg are both expected to testify at the trial, which could run for several weeks.

Shifting politics

The case, FTC v Meta, was filed during US President Donald Trump's first administration but risks becoming politicized during his second term. Mr Zuckerberg has lobbied Trump in person to have the FTC drop the case, according to the Wall Street Journal. When asked by the BBC to confirm that report, Meta sidestepped the question but said in a statement: ""The FTC's lawsuits against Meta defies reality."" ""More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the commission's action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final,"" a Meta spokesperson told the BBC. Relations between Mr Zuckerberg and Trump had been frosty partly because Trump was barred from Meta's social media platforms after the US Capitol riot in January 2021. Since then, the relationship has thawed somewhat. Meta contributed $1m (£764,400) to Trump's inaugural fund, and in January announced Ultimate Fighting Championship Fighter (UFC) boss Dana White, a close Trump ally, would join its board of directors. The company also announced in January that it was doing away with independent fact-checkers.

'A very clear message'

President Trump's move to fire two FTC commissioners in March also hangs over the case. As Democrats, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya were in the minority on the five-seat commission. Until Wednesday, just two seats of those seats were filled, both by Republicans. Another Republican was confirmed by the Senate on Thursday. Slaughter and Bedoya - who are suing the Trump administration to be reinstated - say the move to push them out was meant to intimidate. ""The president sent a very clear signal not only to us but to Chairman Ferguson and Commissioner [Melissa] Holyoak that if they do something he doesn't like, he could fire them too,"" Slaughter told the BBC in a recent interview. ""So if they don't want to do a favor for his political allies, they're on the chopping block as well,"" Slaughter said. Slaughter and Bedoya both expressed alarm at recent reports about Zuckerberg's lobbying efforts. ""My hope is that there is no political interference,"" Mr Bedoya told the BBC.

Reuters

The FTC did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC. Ferguson, who was appointed as FTC chair by Trump, recently told The Verge he would ""obey lawful orders"" when asked what he would do if the president directed him to drop a lawsuit like the one against Meta. Ferguson added that he would be very surprised if anything like that ever happened. The FTC is considered a key antitrust watchdog. In recent years, it has returned hundreds of millions of dollars to victims of fraud, in addition to passing laws that ban junk fees and subscription traps. But as the Meta trial begins, it's among the many independent regulatory agencies that the administration seems keen to rein in. Chair Ferguson is also recently quoted reaffirming his belief that independent regulatory bodies are ""not good for democracy.""

A 38-year-old man has been arrested and is due to be charged following an alleged arson attack on the official residence of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, authorities have said. Cody Balmer faces charges of attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson and aggravated assault. The arrest came hours after Shapiro, often touted as a future White House contender, woke up in the middle of the night to authorities banging on the door of his home as a fire spread. At a news conference on Sunday, Shapiro said he was ""obviously emotional"" as he recalled what had happened. The Democrat and his family were able to evacuate unscathed, but their home in the state capital of Harrisburg was severely damaged.

""I refuse to be trapped by the bondage that someone attempted to put on me by attacking us as they did last night,"" he told reporters. Hours before the fire, Shapiro and his family had celebrated the first night of Passover, a Jewish holiday, at home. ""When we were in the state dining room last night, we told the story of Passover,"" he said - adding that Balmer's motives were not known. Police Deputy Commissioner George Bivens said the suspect had a homemade incendiary device in his possession and was arrested in the Harrisburg area. Authorities believe the suspect was able to hop a fence surrounding the home and get inside to start the blaze, which is still being investigated.

US teen accused of killing parents as part of Trump assassination plot

Investigators also discovered antisemitic writings in which the accused allegedly detailed his plans to kill Trump as a part of a broader goal to overthrow the government, according to the court document.

A newly unsealed search warrant also alleges that the suspect's phone contained material relating to a neo-Nazi group called the Order of Nine Angles and praise for Adolf Hitler.

Nikita Casap, 17, has been charged with the killing of his mother, Tatiana Casap, 35, and his stepfather Donald Mayer, 51, who were found dead at their home on 28 February.

A high school student from Wisconsin killed his parents as part of a larger plot to assassinate US President Donald Trump, the FBI has said.

The suspect is accused of first-degree intentional homicide and seven other felony counts, including hiding a corpse and identity theft.

The parents were found dead when local officials visited their home in the village of Waukesha, near Milwaukee, after the boy failed to attend school for two weeks.

Mr Mayer had died from a gunshot wound to the head, while Ms Casap died from multiple gunshot wounds on or about 11 February, according to a criminal complaint concerning the teenager.

The same day their bodies were discovered, the defendant was pulled over by police in the state of Kansas while driving a 2018 Volkswagen Atlas belonging to Mr Mayer, investigators said.

In the car was Mr Mayer's Smith & Wesson .357 pistol, four credit cards belonging to the couple, ""multiple pieces"" of valuable jewelry, a pried-open safe and $14,000 (£10,700) in currency, most of which was inside a Bible, said the criminal complaint.

In writings found by investigators, the suspect expressed white supremacist beliefs and called for Trump's assassination to start a political revolution, according to the search warrant.

The alleged double murder ""appeared to be an effort to obtain the financial means and autonomy necessary to carrying out his plan"", investigators wrote.

The court documents allege the suspect was speaking with people in Russia about plans to kill his parents.

Authorities said the teenager paid for a drone and explosives to use in an attack - and had plans to escape to Ukraine.

""He was in touch with other parties about his plan to kill the president and overthrow the government of the Unites States,"" investigators wrote.

The suspect had a preliminary court hearing on 9 April. He has not entered a plea to the charges.

He is next due to appear in court for an arraignment - where he will be formally given the charges against him - on 7 May, according to the Waukesha County Court. He is being held on a $1m (£764,000) bond.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62g8d47z86o,1

Ali Abbas Ahmadi/BBC Ford workers Kathryn Lawton (L) and Christina Grossi are afraid the tariffs could upend their lives

For more than a century, a member of the Lawton family has worked in Canada's car industry. Kathryn Lawton and husband Chad both work for the carmaker in Windsor, the heart of Canada's automobile sector, just a bridge away from the US state of Michigan. Her children are ""fifth generation Ford workers"", she says. So when US President Donald Trump suggested that Canada stole the American auto industry, Chad Lawton calls it ""ludicrous"". ""These were never American jobs. These were Canadian jobs,"" he told the BBC, on the day that Trump's auto tariffs came into force. ""They've always been Canadian jobs, and they're going to stay Canadian jobs because we didn't take them from them. We created them, we sustained them."" Kathryn agreed: ""This is Ford City right here."" Tucked away in southwestern Ontario, Windsor finds itself on one of the front lines of Trump's trade war. It faces a 25% tariff on foreign-made vehicles - reduced by half for cars made with 50% US-made components or more - as well as blanket 25% US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. US tariffs on auto parts are expected next month.

Ali Abbas Ahmadi/BBC A mural harking back to the history of the Windsor neighbourhood around the Ford plant, when it was known simply as 'Ford City'

The region of just over 422,000 grew alongside Detroit - nicknamed Motor City for its role as an auto manufacturing hub - turning the region into an important centre for North American automobile production. Ford first established its presence in Windsor in 1896, while the first Stellantis (then Chrysler) factory arrived in 1928, with dozens of factories and suppliers springing up around the city and surrounding region in the ensuing decades. Much of the manufacturing has since left the city, though it still boasts two Ford engine factories and a Stellantis assembly plant, which employ thousands. WATCH: Is the US heading for a recession?

EXPLAINER: What are tariffs, and why is Trump using them? Workers on both sides of the border have built iconic vehicles over the decades, most recently models like the Dodge Charger and the Ford F-150. Some 24,000 people work directly in the automotive industry in Windsor-Essex, while an estimated 120,000 other jobs depend on the sector. A drive through the neighbourhood around the Ford factory feels like a trip back in time, showcasing classic bungalows from the last century. Many have seen better days, though each boasts a verandah and small front yard. Large murals celebrating the city's automotive history punctuate the scenery.

Ali Abbas Ahmadi/BBC Chad Lawton has been at Ford for 31 years, and says he has never seen a crisis like this

Windsor has weathered the challenges of the North American auto sector alongside Michigan, as the industry shares a deeply integrated supply chain. Chad Lawton points to the 2008 financial crisis, when the Big Three American automakers - Ford, General Motors and Chrysler - faced staggering losses, and GM and Chrysler received billions in US bailouts to avoid bankruptcy. That period was ""bad, not just for next door, but also we went through a very, very rough time"", he said. ""This feels the same. The level of anxiety with the workers, the level of fear, the idea and the belief that this is just something that is so completely out of your control that you can't wrap your head around what to do."" John D'Agnolo, president of Unifor Local 200, which represents Ford workers in Windsor, said the situation ""has created havoc"". ""I think we're going to see a recession,"" he said. He continued: ""People aren't going to buy anything. I gotta tell my members not to buy anything. They gotta pay rent and food for their kids.""

Ali Abbas Ahmadi/BBC Windsor residents have a front-row seat to Detroit and the struggles of its auto sector

What makes the tariffs such a hard pill to swallow for auto workers the BBC spoke to is that this situation has been brought about by the US, Canada's closest economic and security ally. ""It seems like a stab in the back,"" said Austin Welzel, 27, an assembly line worker at Stellantis. ""It's almost like our neighbors, our friends - they don't want to work with us."" Christina Grossi, who has worked at Ford for 25 years, said the prospect of losing her job, and what it will mean to her family, is ""terrifying"". But Ms Grossi also fears losing the meaning she gets from her work. ""You've been doing this job for so long and you really take pride in it, you're proud of what you're putting out to the public,"" she said. ""And now someone's taking away the opportunity to do that.""

Laura Dawson, the executive director of Future Borders Coalition, said the tariffs could cause major upheavals throughout the sector due to its deep integration, with ripple effects felt across the continent if exports from Canada stop for more than a week. She said the US tariffs structure is extremely complicated. Cars crossing the border will need every component to be assessed for ""qualifying content"" - where it originates, the cost of labour to produce it, and - if it contains steel or aluminium - where that metal came from. ""Every part of an automobile is literally under a microscope for where it was produced and how,"" she said. The US tariffs have been a major factor in Canada's general election, which is on 28 April, with Canada's political parties rolling out suites of plans on the campaign trail to help the auto sector.

LISTEN: World Questions programme - Canada Liberal leader Mark Carney, the current prime minister, has pledged to create a C$2bn ($1.4bn; £1.1bn) fund to boost competitiveness and protect manufacturing jobs, alongside plans to build an ""all-in-Canada"" auto component parts network. In his role as prime minister, he imposed last week a reported C$35bn in counter auto tariffs, in addition to previously announced reciprocal measures on the US. Carney's main rival, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, has vowed to remove sales tax on Canadian vehicles, and to create a fund for companies affected by the tariffs to help keep their employees. Jagmeet Singh, whose left-wing New Democratic Party is fighting for a competitive seat in Windsor, has pledged to use every dollar from counter tariffs to help workers, and to stop manufacturers from moving equipment to the US.

Albert Luthuli: South Africa re-opens inquest into Nobel laureate's death,"South Africa re-opens inquest into Nobel laureate's death

Luthuli, who at the time of his death was the leader of the then-banned African National Congress (ANC), won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1960 for spearheading the fight against apartheid.

Activists and his family have long cast doubt on the official version of events, and have said they welcomed the re-opening of the inquest.

A 1967 inquest ruled that Chief Albert Luthuli was walking on a railway line when he was struck by a train and died after fracturing his skull.

A South African court has begun a fresh inquest into the death of one of the most renowned campaigners against the racist system of apartheid, which had initially been described as accidental.

The ANC went on to lead the struggle against white-minority rule and came to power in 1994, following the first democratic elections.

The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has said that it ""will be presenting evidence before the court in an attempt to have the initial findings into the deaths of Chief Luthuli... overturned"". It has not said what that evidence is.

Nearly six decades ago, the initial inquiry into the Nobel laureate's death ""found that there was no evidence which disclosed any criminal culpability on the part of any of the employees of the South African Railways or anyone else"", the NPA said last week.

But campaigners suspected the authorities had killed him and covered it up.

Luthuli's grandson, Sandile Luthuli, told the BBC that the initial investigation had been a ""whitewash meant to cover up the activities of the [former] apartheid government"".

""We look forward to an independent judiciary that will preside over this matter and [make] independent findings on exactly what transpired on that fateful day in July 1967,"" he told the BBC.

Sandile Luthuli praised the NPA for its handling of the complex case and the ongoing engagement with relatives since the matter was referred to prosecutors in the early 2000s.

On the family's expectations from the nearly month-long hearing, Luthuli said they hoped to find closure on two levels - first on how chief Luthuli really died and secondly, who should be held criminally liable for his death.

""Hopefully, through this inquest, we will be able to find both. If not, maybe the first one, being exactly the opportunity to correct the historical record and really debunk his myth of him being hit by a train,"" he said.

Another of Luthuli's grandchildren, Albert Mthunzi Luthuli, told South Africa's IOL news site that the family welcomed the re-opening of the inquest, even though it was now years after the deaths of ""many people that we suspected of being involved in my grandfather's murder"".

""We believe the TRC [Truth and Reconciliation Commission] let many families of victims down by giving amnesty to apartheid murderers,"" he added, referring to the post-apartheid process where perpetrators of violence in the previous decades were encouraged to come forward to fully confess their crimes.

At the time of his death, Luthuli was not allowed to leave his residential area in Groutville - now in KwaZulu-Natal province - or take part in politics.

He was South Africa's first winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. The award was later given to three other South Africans: Archbishop Desmond Tutu in 1984, and Nelson Mandela and FW de Klerk in 1993.

The Luthuli case is one of two highly anticipated inquests into the deaths of anti-apartheid figures re-opening on Monday. The other concerns lawyer Mlungisi Griffiths Mxenge, who was killed in 1981, but this was postponed to 17 June after a brief sitting on Monday.

He had been stabbed 45 times and his throat had been slit.

An inquest into his death a year later failed to identify his murderers and it was only nine years later that they were revealed - when Butana Almond Nofemela, confessed to killing Mxenge and seven other ANC members.

He was part of a covert hit-squad, or counter-insurgency unit, that detained and killed anti-apartheid activists.

Nofemela, together with the squad's commander Dirk Coetzee and David Tshikalange, were in 1997 found guilty of Mxenge's murder but were granted amnesty by the TRC before the criminal case could be concluded.

Explaining the reopening of the inquest into Mxenge's death last year, the justice ministry said this was because new evidence had emerged, suggesting that ""certain critical information"" had not been presented to the TRC.

In South Africa, inquests often look into determining how a person died and whether anyone should be held responsible for their death.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg87q6q9d3o,1

Popstars sneaked into the audience at Coachella to watch each other perform this weekend - as Lady Gaga wowed festivalgoers with a dramatic main stage set. Fans swarmed to catch the Poker Face singer perform songs from her new album Mayhem, delivering a visual spectacle by opening her set with what can only be described as a satanic ritual to her 2011 song Bloody Mary. Spotted watching on were South Korean pop group Blackpink, whose member Lisa was also seen dancing to K-pop boy band Enhypen after performing herself. Meanwhile, Beautiful Things singer Benson Boone surprised the crowd by bringing out Sir Brian May for a rendition of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody while executing a trademark front flip.

Gabon election: Coup leader Oligui Nguema wins poll by huge margin,"Gabon coup leader wins election by huge margin

AFP Gen Brice Oligui Nguema has been handed a seven-year mandate by an electorate relieved that the Bongo era is now past

Gabon's military leader Gen Brice Oligui Nguema - who in 2023 led a coup that ended a near-60-year dynasty - has won Saturday's presidential election with more than 90% of the vote, provisional results show. Ahead of the vote, critics argued that the new constitution and electoral code were designed to give Oligui Nguema a comfortable pathway to the top job. Some opposition heavyweights who could have posed a serious political challenge were excluded from the race. His election victory consolidates his grip on power, nearly two years after he masterminded the demise of President Ali Bongo, whose family had been in power in Gabon since 1967.

Oligui Nguema, 50, faced seven other candidates, including former Prime Minister Alain Claude Bilie-by-Nze, who served under the Bongo regime, and two stalwarts of the former ruling PDG party, Stéphane Germain Iloko and Alain Simplice Boungouères.

""Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema is elected [president] by absolute majority of votes cast, with 575,222 votes,"" Interior Minister Hermann Immongault announced. His main challenger, Bilie-by-Nze, received just over 3% of the votes. More than seven out of 10 registered voters took part in the poll, which the authorities and some observers hailed as signifying the election took place transparently and peacefully. There were complaints of instances of irregularities in the process, however. At some polling stations the vote was delayed, while some voters on the electoral roll were not able to find where they were meant to cast their ballot. Bilie-by-Nze said he was particularly concerned by claims that in some places unmarked ballot papers were not kept in a secure location, and that he feared they could be used to stuff ballot boxes. Oligui Nguema's victory brings him a seven-year mandate and the resources to tackle the corruption and bad governance that characterised the Bongos' time in power.

The highly articulate former commander of the elite Republican Guard proved to be very popular among a population relieved to be rid of dynastic rule, promising to rid the country of the ill that had tainted Gabon's image. The small oil- and timber-rich central African nation is home to just 2.5 million people. Despite its resources, about 35% of the population still live below the poverty line of $2 (£1.50) a day.

"Trump in excellent health, says White House doctor","Trump in excellent health, says White House doctor

At 78, Trump was the oldest president to take office in January, though his predecessor, Joe Biden, was older at 82 by the time he left.

""President Trump remains in excellent health, exhibiting robust cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, and general physical function,"" his doctor, Captain Sean Barbabella, said in a memo.

In the first annual physical of his second presidential term at a Washington DC-area hospital, Trump was also found to have scarring ""on the right ear from a gunshot wound"", after an assassination attempt last July.

US President Donald Trump is in ""excellent cognitive and physical health"", says his White House physician.

As a part of Friday's nearly five-hour medical examination at the Walter Reed hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, Trump received several blood tests, a cardiac examination and ultrasounds, said his doctor, a US Navy emergency physician who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.

""President Trump exhibits excellent cognitive and physical health and is fully fit to execute the duties of the Commander-in-Chief and Head of State,"" Dr Barbabella wrote in the memo released by the White House on Sunday.

The president received neurological tests on his mental status, nerves, motor and sensory function and reflexes and showed no signs of depression or anxiety, according to the memo.

Trump was also given the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and scored 30 out of 30, said Dr Barbabella. The test is commonly used to detect cognitive decline and early signs of dementia and has tasks such as naming animals, drawing a clock and repeating words back five minutes later.

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Trump said he ""got every answer right"" on the cognitive test.

""Overall, I felt I was in very good shape,"" Trump said. ""A good heart, a good soul, a very good soul.""

He added that doctors had given him ""a little bit"" of advice on lifestyle changes to improve his health, though he did not provide details.

Dr Barbabella also said Trump had ""minor sun damage"" and a few ""benign skin lesions"".

The president takes several medications to control his cholesterol - Rosuvastatin and Ezetimibe - as well as Aspirin for cardiac prevention and Mometasone cream for a skin condition, said the memo.

Trump's cardiac examination showed ""no abnormalities"", wrote Dr Barbabella.

The examination noted the president's medical history of ""well-controlled hypercholesterolemia"", a condition which can increase a patient's risk of a heart attack.

Other conditions noted in his medical history included a past Covid infection, rosacea, which is a skin condition often causing redness in the face, and a benign colon polyp.

The president weighs 224lb (101kg) and stands 6ft 2.5in tall, according to the records from Dr Barbabella. Trump has shed some pounds since February 2019, when he weighed 243lb.

Under the Body Mass Index calculator, he would currently be categorised within the overweight range, and not obese.

The memo noted that the president's ""joints and muscles have a full range of motion"", while crediting his good health to an active lifestyle, including ""frequent victories in golf events"".

It is the first medical report on Trump released to the public since a gunman tried to kill him at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last July, grazing his ear with a bullet.

At the time, Trump's former White House doctor, Ronny Jackson, released a report saying his injuries from the incident were superficial.

During Trump's first term in office, a White House doctor said he was in good health but needed to lose weight and exercise.

On the campaign trail, Trump frequently attacked his rival, Biden, over his cognitive and physical health.

After a poor debate performance last year against Trump, Biden declined to commit to taking a cognitive test, which he said he had not undergone while in office.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9vx1v1rx1o,1
Mario Vargas Llosa: Giant of Latin American literature,"Mario Vargas Llosa: Giant of Latin American literature dies at 89

11 hours ago Share Save Share Save

Getty Images Mario Vargas Llosa in 1990

Mario Vargas Llosa, who has died at the age of 89 in his native Peru, was a towering figure in Latin American literature and culture who rarely shied away from controversy. With more than 50 works to his name, many of which have been widely translated, Vargas Llosa won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2010 when judges dubbed him a ""divinely gifted story-teller"". His depictions of authoritarianism, violence and machismo, using rich language and imagery, made him a star of the Latin American Boom literary movement that shone a global spotlight on the continent. At first sympathetic to left-wing ideas, he grew disillusioned with Latin America's revolutionary causes, eventually running unsuccessfully for the Peruvian presidency with a centre-right party in 1990. Vargas Llosa was born in 1936 to a middle-class family in Arequipa in southern Peru. After his parents separated while he was an infant, he moved to Cochabamba in Bolivia with his great-grandparents. He returned to Peru aged 10 and six years later he wrote his first play, The Escape of the Inca. He graduated from Lima University, studied in Spain and later moved to Paris. His first novel, The Time of the Hero, was an indictment of corruption and abuse at a Peruvian military school. Written at a time when the country's military wielded significant political and social power, it was published in 1962. Its forceful, menacing imagery was condemned by several Peruvian generals. One accused Vargas Llosa of having a ""degenerate mind"". It was based on the writer's own time as a teenager at the Leoncio Prado Military Academy, which he described in 1990 as ""an extremely traumatic experience"". His two years there made him see his country ""as a violent society, filled with bitterness, made up of social, cultural, and racial factions in complete opposition"". The school itself burnt 1,000 copies of the novel on its grounds, Vargas Llosa claimed. His experimental second novel The Green House (1966) was set in the Peruvian desert and jungle, and described an alliance of pimps, missionaries and soldiers based around a brothel. The two novels helped found the Latin American Boom literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The Boom was characterised by experimental and explicitly political works that reflected a continent in turmoil.

Getty Images Gabriel García Márquez in the 1970s

Its leading authors, who included Vargas Llosa's Colombian friend and sometime rival Gabriel García Márquez - who pioneered the kaleidoscopic magical realism style of writing - became household names and their works were read around the world. Famously the two authors did not speak to each other for decades after Vargas Llosa punched García Márquez in the face in a Mexican cinema in 1976. Reports of why Vargas Llosa punched his Colombian friend differ. Friends of García Márquez said the dispute had revolved around García Márquez's friendship with Vargas Llosa's then-wife, Patricia, but Vargas Llosa told students at a Madrid university in 2017 that it had been down to their opposing views on Cuba and its communist leader, Fidel Castro. They reconciled in 2007 and three years later, in 2010, Vargas Llosa was awarded the Nobel Prize - the first South American writer to be chosen for the literature prize since Gabriel García Márquez took the honour in 1982. Much of Vargas Llosa's work is inseparable from the instability and violence in parts of Latin America in the second half of the 20th Century as the region experienced waves of revolutions and military rule. His novel Conversations in the Cathedral (1969) was celebrated for exposing how the Peruvian dictatorship of 1948-56 under Manuel Odría controlled and eventually ruined the lives of ordinary people. Like many intellectuals, Vargas Llosa supported Fidel Castro but became disillusioned with the communist leader following the ""Padilla Affair"" when poet Heberto Padilla was imprisoned for criticising the Cuban government in 1971. In 1983 Vargas Llosa was appointed president of a commission investigating the gruesome killing in a village in the Peruvian Andes of eight journalists, which became known as the Uchuraccay massacre. Peruvian officials maintained that the journalists had been killed by indigenous villagers who had mistaken the journalists for members of the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla group. The commission's report backed the official line, leading to fierce criticism of Vargas Llosa by those who believed that the gruesome nature of the crime and the horrific mutilations inflicted on the body were the hallmark of an infamous anti-terrorist police rather than signs of ""indigenous violence"". Moving further right on the political spectrum, in 1990 Vargas Llosa ran for the Peruvian presidency with the centre-right Frente Democrático coalition on a neo-liberal platform. He lost to Alberto Fujimori, who went on to govern Peru for the following 10 years. Despite the criticism levelled against him over the investigation into the Uchuraccay massacre, Vargas Llosa continued to expose state terror and abuse of power through literature. His novel The Feast of the Goat, published in 2000, focused on dictator Rafael Trujillo, who ruled the Dominican Republic for 31 years until his assassination in 1961. The novel won praise from the Nobel Prize Committee for its attention to ""structures of power"" and ""images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat"". Other works were adapted for the big screen. His book Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, based on his first marriage, was adapted in 1990 into a Hollywood feature film, Tune in Tomorrow. His later work covered figures as diverse as Irish nationalist Roger Casement (The Dream of the Celt, 2012). He spent the latter years of his life in Peru as well as Madrid.

AFP Zamzam camp near el-Fasher hosts hundreds of thousands of people, who are living in famine-like conditions

Devastating attacks on a camp hosting hundreds of thousands of people who had fled Sudan's civil war have continued for a third day, residents have told the BBC. One person in the Zamzam camp described the situation as ""catastrophic"" while another said things were ""dire"". More than 100 civilians, among them at least 20 children and a medical team, have been killed in a series of assaults that began late last week in Sudan's western Darfur region, the UN has said. The attacks – on the city of el-Fasher and two nearby camps – have been blamed on the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). On Sunday the group said it had taken control of Zamzam but denied reports of atrocities.

The camps, Zamzam and Abu Shouk, provide temporary homes to more than 700,000 people, many of whom are facing famine-like conditions. News of the attacks comes on the eve of the second anniversary of the start of the civil war between the RSF and the army. Contacting the BBC on Sunday morning, one Zamzam resident who works at a community kitchen providing food for those in the camp, said ""a large number of young people"" had been killed. ""Those who were working in the community kitchen have been killed, and the doctors who were part of the initiative to reopen the hospital were also killed,"" Mustafa, 34, said in a WhatsApp audio message. ""My uncle and my cousin were killed. People are wounded, and there is no medicine or hospital to save them - they are dying from bleeding. ""The shelling is still ongoing, and we are expecting more attacks in the morning."" He added that all routes out of the camp were closed and it was ""surrounded from all four directions"".

Another resident, Wasir, said that ""nothing [was] left in Zamzam"". ""A large number of civilians have fled, and we are still trying to leave, but we haven't succeeded, all the roads are blocked, and we have children with us. ""Death is everywhere. As I speak to you now from inside the trench, there is shelling happening."" Some camp residents have got out and made the 15km (nine mile) journey to el-Fasher, according to North Darfur's Health Minister Ibrahim Khater. ""I am observing many people walking from Zamzam - mostly children, women and the elderly,"" he said in a message to the BBC. ""Some were injured, tired and saying they lost their family - dead on the streets. The situation is catastrophic."" The UN's humanitarian co-ordinator in Sudan, Clementine Nkweta-Salami, said she was ""appalled and gravely alarmed"" by reports from Darfur. ""This represents yet another deadly and unacceptable escalation in a series of brutal attacks on displaced people and aid workers,"" she added in a statement. The US State Department also said it was ""deeply alarmed by reports of attacks by the RSF on Zamzam and Abu Shouk"", adding: ""We condemn the RSF's attacks on the most vulnerable of civilians."" British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who is hosting a conference on Sudan on Tuesday, described the reports of ""indiscriminate RSF attacks"" as ""shocking"".

Aid organisation Relief International said nine of its workers ""were mercilessly killed including doctors, referral drivers and a team leader"" in the attack on Zamzam. The charity, which said it was the last provider of critical health services in the camp, alleged RSF fighters were to blame. ""We understand that this was a targeted attack on all health infrastructure in the region to prevent access to healthcare for internally displaced people. ""We are horrified that one of our clinics was also part of this attack - along with other health facilities in el-Fasher."" Kashif Shafique, the charity's Sudan director, told the BBC's Newshour programme that what happened was not random. Relaying what two surviving female members of staff had described, he said RSF fighters went into a safety bunker and shot the nine victims in the head and chest. In a statement released on Saturday, the RSF said it was not responsible for attacks on civilians and that scenes of killing in Zamzam were staged to discredit its forces. The following day, the group said it had completed a ""successful liberation"" of the camp from Sudan's army. The RSF accused the army of using Zamzam as ""a military barracks, and innocent civilians as human shields"". Assessing satellite images, a team of specialists at Yale University in the US said on Friday that ""this attack conservatively represents the most significant ground-based attack on Zamzam... since fighting erupted in the el-Fasher area in spring of 2024"". The Yale School of Public Health's Humanitarian Research Lab said it had observed that ""arson attacks have burned multiple structures and significant areas of the camp in the center, south, and southeast portions of the camp"". The war - a power struggle between the army and the RSF - has created the world's largest humanitarian crisis, forcing more than 12 million people from their homes and pushing communities into hunger. It began on 15 April 2023, after the leaders of the army and RSF fell out over the political future of the country. El-Fasher is the last major town in Darfur under army control and has been under siege by the RSF for a year.

Ukraine war: ‘Russians are even trying to ban our holidays',"'Russians are even trying to ban our holidays' - life in occupied Ukraine

2 days ago Share Save Vitaliy Shevchenko Russia editor, BBC Monitoring Share Save

""Russians are trying to ban everything Ukrainian here: language, and also traditions. Even Ukrainian holidays are forbidden."" This is the sorrow and fear of a rarely heard voice from within Ukraine - that of someone living in one of the Russian-occupied areas of the country. We are calling her Maria. As the US leads efforts to negotiate peace in Ukraine, those living under Russian occupation face a brutal, repressive future. Already, the Kremlin has put in place severe restrictions designed to stamp out Ukrainian identity, including harsh punishments for anyone who dares to disagree. Now, there are fears that Kyiv could be forced to give up at least some of the territory occupied by Russia as part of a potential ceasefire or peace deal. Ukrainian officials reject this, but Moscow says that at the very least it wants to fully capture four Ukrainian regions it partly controls - Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia - in addition to Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. Due to repression by the Russian authorities, speaking to the media and even your own relatives in occupied territories can be fraught with danger. The Kremlin has also launched a wide-ranging campaign to force Ukrainians in occupied territories to take Russian passports. Evidence suggests that Ukrainians are being denied healthcare and free movement unless they take up Russian citizenship. Maria (not her real name) said she was a member of an all-female underground resistance group waging a campaign of peaceful resistance in those territories, mainly by distributing leaflets and newsletters. In an interview with the BBC's Today programme, she used a Ukrainian proverb to describe the danger she is facing: ""You have fear in your eyes, but your hands are still doing it. Of course it's scary."" The BBC cannot reveal her real name or location so as not to put her in danger.

Atmosphere of fear

The atmosphere of fear and suspicion is such that when I was trying to contact residents of occupied Mariupol, I was accused of being a Russian journalist. ""You won't like what I've got to say. People like you kill if you tell them the truth,"" one person told me via direct message on social media. They claimed to be from the port city, captured by the Russians in May 2022 after a bloody siege that left it in ruins.

Later, I asked some Ukrainian friends if I could speak to their relatives living in occupied areas. All said no - that would be too dangerous. Sofia (also not her real name) is from a village in Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region. It was occupied at the start of the full-scale invasion of 2022. Sofia is now in the UK but her parents are still in her village and she told me about the care she needs to take when talking to them. ""About a year ago, my parents were searched by the [Russian security service] FSB. They confiscated their phones, accusing them of telling the Ukrainian army about where Russian troops were stationed. That wasn't true, and later the Russian military told my parents that they had been reported by their neighbours. That's why I try not to provoke anything like that,"" Sofia tells me. ""I have to read between the lines when they tell me about what's going on."" And just speaking to them at all is becoming more difficult. Sofia says that her parents are unable even to top up their mobile phones or insure their car because they refuse to take Russian passports. ""It's getting really awkward living without Russian IDs,"" she says.

Yeva, whose name we have also changed, has a sister working at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. ""Whenever we move from the weather or our children on to our subjects, her tone changes,"" Yeva says. ""She tells me: 'You don't understand!'"" ""What I do understand is that being a nuclear power plant worker, her phone is likely to be bugged,"" Yeva tells me. She also says that her sister often repeats pro-Russian narratives when speaking to her. Another friend, Kateryna, tells me that someone she knows in the occupied part of Kherson region was thrown into a punishment cellar for talking to her brother who had been helping the Ukrainian army. ""I can't put them at risk,"" Kateryna told me when I asked to be put in touch with her friend.

Ways of punishment

According to Maria, Russian administrations have been installing surveillance systems to monitor any manifestations of dissent. ""They are putting up a lot of CCTV cameras to control everybody, to find all the activists,"" she says. Numerous Ukrainian activists have been killed or disappeared under Russian occupation. According to the Ukrainian rights group Zmina, at least 121 activists, volunteers and journalists have been killed during the full-scale invasion, most of them during its first year. Prior to the invasion, Russia had drawn up lists of activists to be arrested or killed, the group says. More recently, Russia-installed authorities have been applying a host of repressive laws against dissenters. They can be penalised for alleged transgressions such as spreading ""false information"", ""discrediting"" the Russian army or supporting ""extremism"". In Crimea alone, 1,279 cases have been launched so far on charges of ""discrediting"" the Russian armed forces, says the Ukrainian government office for Crimea. According to it, 224 people have been jailed in the occupied Ukrainian region for expressing dissent, most of them members of the indigenous Crimean Tatar community.

Despite the dangers, a number of underground resistance groups are active in occupied parts of Ukraine. Zla Mavka, which takes its name from a Ukrainian mythical creature, is a non-violent all-female movement mostly focused on distributing posters and leaflets across occupied regions. In Melitopol, Zaporizhzhia region, partisans have been targeting occupation troops and their transport while the Crimean Tatar group Atesh has been involved in reconnaissance and subversion. Meanwhile, the Yellow Ribbon movement distributes Ukrainian symbols in occupied territories. Because of the absence of independent media in occupied parts of Ukraine, it is hard to verify the impact of such activities. There is no evidence, however, to suggest that they have caused significant disruption for occupation forces.

Obesity in India: How 'pot belly' went from status symbol to silent killer,"Indian pot belly: From status symbol to silent killer

2 days ago Share Save Soutik Biswas • @soutikBBC India correspondent Share Save

The Indian pot belly - once a badge of prosperity, indulgence and aging respectability - has long been a target of satire and social commentary. In literature, it quietly signalled comfort or complacency; in films, it became a shorthand for the lazy official, gluttonous uncle, or a corrupt policeman. Cartoons exaggerated it to mock politicians. In rural settings, it was once considered a status symbol - a sign that ""this man eats well"". But what was once dismissed or even celebrated is now raising alarm bells. The obesity crisis in India is ballooning - and the seemingly harmless pot belly may be a far bigger villain than we think. India had the second-highest number of overweight or obese adults in 2021, with 180 million affected - behind only China. A new Lancet study warns this number could soar to 450 million by 2050, nearly a third of the country's projected population. Globally, more than half of all adults and a third of children and adolescents are expected to face the same fate. At the heart of this issue in India lies the pot belly, or in medical terms, abdominal obesity. This form of obesity refers to the accumulation of excess fat around the belly and doctors say it's more than a cosmetic concern. As far back as the 1990s, studies showed a clear link between belly fat and chronic conditions like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease.

Getty Images By 2050, 450 million Indians are projected to be overweight or obese

Obesity isn't just abdominal. It appears in different patterns, depending on fat distribution: peripheral obesity affects the hips, thighs, and buttocks, while generalised obesity involves fat spread more evenly across the body. The numbers on abdominal obesity in India are already troubling. According to the latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) - which, for the first time, measured waist and hip sizes - about 40% of women and 12% of men in India have abdominal obesity. Abdominal obesity, based on Indian guidelines, means a waist over 90cm (35 inches) for men and 80cm (31 inches) for women. Among women aged 30 to 49, nearly one in two already show signs of it. Urban populations were found to be more affected than rural ones, with high waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratios emerging as a key red flag. Indians are getting fatter - and it's a big problem

Why are Indian children getting fatter? So why is belly fat such a big deal? One reason is insulin resistance - a condition where the body stops responding properly to insulin, the hormone that helps regulate blood sugar. Abdominal fat disrupts how the body uses insulin, making it harder to control blood sugar. Studies have found South Asians, including Indians, tend to have more body fat than white Caucasians at the same Body Mass Index. (BMI is a simple measure that assesses a person's weight in relation to their height.) It's not just how much fat you have - it's where it goes. In South Asians, fat tends to collect around the trunk and under the skin, but not always deep in the abdomen as visceral fat. Though South Asians may have less of the more harmful deep abdominal fat around organs like the liver and pancreas, studies show their larger, less efficient fat cells struggle to store fat under the skin. As a result, excess fat spills into vital organs that regulate metabolism - like the liver and pancreas - raising the risk of diabetes and heart disease.

Reuters India, China, and the USA lead eight nations housing over half the world's overweight and obese population

Scientists still don't fully understand the biological reasons behind the fat distribution patterns. Though numerous genetic studies have been conducted, no single gene has consistently explained this tendency. One theory offers an evolutionary root. India, for centuries, was racked by famines and chronic food shortages, leaving generations to survive on meagre nutrition. In such conditions, the human body adapted for survival in extreme scarcity. The body needed a depot for this energy and the abdomen, being the most expandable area, became the prime storage site. Over time, as food became more plentiful, this fat store continued to grow - eventually to harmful levels. ""It's a conjectural but plausible evolutionary theory - one that can't be proven, but makes sense,"" says Anoop Misra, who heads Delhi's Fortis-C-DOC Centre of Excellence for Diabetes, Metabolic Diseases and Endocrinology. Last year, in a paper doctors belonging to the Indian Obesity Commission redefined obesity guidelines for Asian Indians, moving beyond BMI to better reflect how body fat relates to early health risks. They created a two-stage clinical system that considers fat distribution, related diseases and physical function. Stage one involves a high BMI, but without abdominal obesity, metabolic disease, or physical dysfunction. In such cases, lifestyle changes like diet, exercise and sometimes medication are usually enough. Stage two includes abdominal obesity - the harmful visceral fat - and is often accompanied by health issues like diabetes, knee pain or palpitations. This stage signals higher risk and calls for more intensive management.

Getty Images Bella Ramsey reprises their role of Ellie in season two of The Last of Us

""I made a real decision when I was, like, 11 that I wasn't gonna be like a typical teenager,"" says Bella Ramsey. Talk about an understatement. By the time Bella was 13, they had been cast in the world's biggest TV show at the time, Game of Thrones. And when the actor, now 21 years old, speaks to BBC Newsbeat, it's the night after walking the red carpet at the London premiere of The Last of Us season two. The smash-hit adaptation of the PlayStation video game was a critical and ratings success, launching the young star to full-on leading role status. ""I think it's quite a unique experience,"" Bella, who's originally from Nottingham, England, modestly admits. The rest of this article contains spoilers for The Last of Us season one.

Bella, who uses gender-neutral pronouns, plays Ellie in the HBO drama, set in a post-apocalyptic future where humanity has been almost wiped out by cordyceps. The deadly parasitic fungus turns humans into zombie-like creatures, but Ellie is immune from infection and is humanity's last hope for a cure. In the first season viewers saw a father-daughter relationship slowly blossom between Ellie and mercenary Joel, played by Pedro Pascal. After escorting the 14-year-old on a dangerous journey across the USA to meet doctors working on a vaccine, it becomes apparent Ellie must die for a potential remedy to be produced. Rather than sacrifice her, Joel kills the medics and flees with the unconscious teenager. When she awakes, he lies to her about what happened, and season one's cliffhanger ending leaves viewers with the strong impression that Ellie is well aware of the deception.

So when the new season begins, five years later, ""obviously there's tension in that relationship,"" says Bella. ""It was quite horrible to play."" Young Bella's vow to not be a ""typical teenager"" was actually less about their career and more about their relationship with their parents, they say. No screaming matches, no slamming doors. ""So I never went through that with my dad,"" says Bella. ""Me and my dad are great."" ""So it was kind of sad to do that with Ellie and Joel."" But, Bella adds, Ellie ""is very justified in her feelings about everything"".

Getty Images Co-stars Bella and Pedro Pascal are all smiles off-screen, but season two sees a strained relationship between their characters Ellie and Joel

Ellie is 19 in season two, not too much younger than Bella, who began shooting the first series back in 2021. Number two was delayed by the 2023 Hollywood strikes, so a lot has happened for Bella in the meantime. There's symmetry there. ""It's so fun getting to step back into a character but with kind of new revelations about her and about me in my own life,"" says Bella. ""There's always like a merging of me and whatever character I'm playing and that happens times 10 with Ellie because I'm spending so much time in her skin."" Bella's recently spoken publicly about being diagnosed with autism while working on the first series of the show. ""It was something that I didn't really think about too much before,"" Bella starts. ""Actually, no, that's a lie. I did, because I said that I was neurodiverse before, and then I was like, 'Why don't I just say what it actually is, which is, yeah, I'm autistic."" Bella says opening up has allowed them ""to be a bit more free"" and hopes it will inspire others. ""You can be in industries like this and openly say that you're autistic, why there shouldn't be sort of such a stigma around that and such a fear around that,"" says Bella. ""So I'm very proud to be able to say it out loud and also just to bring more awareness. ""Autism comes in all different shapes and sizes, and and I'm not someone that people would maybe typically see and go like 'oh, you're autistic'.""

Naughty Dog Ellie's relationship with Dina (left), is set to be a key plot point in season two, as it is in part two of the video game

Bella also identifies as non-binary, and the new series of The Last of Us more deeply explores Ellie's same-sex relationship with Dina, played by Isabella Merced. ""I feel like we're still figuring out how to portray queer storylines in the media in a way that feels very authentic but that also feels very genuine in terms of the story,"" says Bella. ""That's what The Last of Us does so well, I think, with Ellie and Dina. ""It doesn't feel like it's like representation added on top to check a box - it really feels like it's just a part of the story. ""So that was what was exciting about getting to portray this sort of relationship in this medium.""

The Last of Us has already been commissioned for a third series after a positive critical reception for season two, so Bella - and Ellie - will still be growing up in the public eye for a while yet. It's something that ""comes with pros and cons,"" says Bella. ""But it's kind of lovely that my growth and development has been immortalised on-screen. ""I feel very grateful for that."" But Bella says there's one thing that doesn't get any easier. ""The more that you grow up, you just realise how little you know, I think. And I think that's something that Ellie is also discovering.""

France considers response after Algeria expels 12 embassy staff,"France is considering its response after Algeria ordered the expulsion of 12 embassy staff over the arrest of an Algerian consulate official in Paris over alleged involvement in the kidnap of a TikTok influencer.

Algiers has given the French representatives 48 hours to leave the country in a move that has stretched already strained relations between the two countries to breaking point. The French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, has warned that if the expulsions go ahead Paris would be forced to respond immediately.

The influencer, Amir Boukhors, 41, is a critic of the Algerian president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, and has more than a million subscribers on TikTok where he posts as Amir DZ. He has lived in France since 2016 and was granted political asylum in 2023. Algeria has issued nine international arrest warrants against him on accusations of fraud and terrorism but France refuses to extradite him.

In April 2024, Boukhors was snatched outside his home in the Val-de-Marne, south of Paris, telling France 2 television in a later interview that he was handcuffed and bundled into a car by four men wearing police armbands. He claimed he was drugged and held in a “container” for more than 24 hours before being released at 3am. “I fell into a trap,” he said.

Three men were arrested and put under investigation on Friday for the “kidnap, holding and arbitrary detention” of Boukhors. France’s national anti-terrorist prosecutor confirmed that one of the men arrested works for the Algerian consulate at Créteil, south-east of Paris.

Algeria’s ordering of the expulsion of French embassy staff came a week after Barrot concluded an official visit to Algeria where he met Tebboune.

“I ask the Algerian authorities to stop these expulsion measures that have no link to an ongoing legal case,” he said on Monday. “If the decision to expel our staff is maintained we will have no other choice than to respond immediately.”

AFP reported that among the embassy staff ordered to leave the country were a number of members attached to France’s interior ministry whose minister, Bruno Retailleau, has taken a hard line against the former French colony.

Bilateral relations between Paris and Algiers have been tense since last July when France supported a Moroccan plan to grant autonomy to the western Sahara against Algerian-backed insurgents who want full independence for the disputed territory. Paris has accused Algeria of refusing to take back its nationals ordered to leave France and considered a security threat. In retaliation, France has threatened to slash the number of visas given to Algerians.

Emmanuel Macron has also called on Algeria to release writer Boualem Sansal, 75, sentenced to five years in prison for “undermining the integrity” of the country.

Algeria has denied the official’s involvement in Boukhors’ kidnapping and after his arrest summoned France’s ambassador, Stéphane Romatet, to express its displeasure at the consular official being arrested “in the public street … without any notification via diplomatic channels”.

UN calls on Trump to exempt poorest countries from ‘reciprocal’ tariffs,"The UN’s trade and development arm, Unctad, is calling on Donald Trump to exempt the world’s poorest and smallest countries from “reciprocal” tariffs, or risk “serious economic harm”.

In a report published on Monday, Unctad identifies 28 nations the US president singled out for a higher tariff rate than the 10% baseline – despite each accounting for less than 0.1% of the US trade deficit.

These include Laos, which is expected to face a 48% tariff; Mauritius, on 40%; and Myanmar, to be hit with 45%, despite trying to recover from a devastating earthquake.

The White House shocked many developing countries with the punitive tariff rates announced this month.

Trump claimed rival economies had “looted, pillaged, raped, plundered” the US with unfair trade practices, and he wanted to create a level playing field.

Unctad said many of the countries targeted with high tariff rates were unlikely to be a threat to the world’s largest economy, given their small size and modest levels of exports.

The White House last week put the higher tariff rates on pause for 90 days, after unleashing chaos on world financial markets, leaving a 10% levy in place across the board.

But the administration’s formal position remains that the “reciprocal” tariff rates will come into force, subject to negotiations.

“The current 90-day pause presents an opportunity to reassess how small and vulnerable economies – including the least developed countries – are treated,” Unctad said.

“This is a critical moment to consider exempting them from tariffs that offer little to no advantage for US trade policy but risk causing serious economic harm.”

Unctad’s analysis said many of these economies were so small that they were likely to generate little demand for US exports, even if they lowered tariffs, as the White House appears to be demanding.

Malawi, facing 18% tariffs, bought just $27m of US exports last year; Mozambique, which faces 16% tariffs, $150m; Cambodia, set for 49% tariffs, $322m.

Unctad’s experts added that 36 of these small and poor countries were likely to generate less than 1% of total US tariff revenue, even if the US did not cut imports from them as the tariffs took effect.

Part of the logic of the tariff policy is meant to be to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US. But for several tiny countries, their key exports are agricultural commodities, for which the US is unlikely to be able to find substitutes elsewhere – let alone develop a domestic industry.

Unctad highlighted the $150m in vanilla imported from Madagascar, close to $800m in cocoa from Ivory Coast and $200m in cocoa from Ghana.

With Madagascar set to face 47% tariffs, for example, the report said the main impact on the US was likely to be higher prices for consumers.

Some of the countries hit by the 10% tariffs – and due to face higher rates when the pause is over – were previously beneficiaries of a US policy called the African Growth and Opportunity Act.

The scheme had been in place since 2000 and gave sub-Saharan African countries tariff-free access to US markets in order to encourage economic development. As many as 32 countries were eligible, before Trump’s announcement appeared to tear up the scheme.

Financial markets and manufacturers in developing countries are continuing to wrestle with the changeable nature of US trade policy.

Trump sowed fresh confusion over the weekend by appearing to revisit an announcement made on Friday, that some hi-tech goods, including laptops, would be exempt from tariffs.

In a post on his social media site Truth Social on Sunday, the president said no one was getting “off the hook”, and the administration would be investigating the “whole electronics supply chain”.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/14/un-calls-on-trump-to-exempt-poorest-countries-from-reciprocal-tariffs,1
More than 200 civilians killed as Sudan’s RSF attacks Darfur displacement camps,"Paramilitaries in Sudan have murdered more than 200 civilians in a wave of attacks in displacement camps and around the city of El Fasher, the last big city still in the hands of the Sudanese army in the Darfur region.

The deaths include at least 56 civilians killed by the Rapid Support Forces over two days of attacks in Um Kadadah, a town they seized on the road to El Fasher.

The violence is some of the worst in the Darfur region since the civil war between the army and the paramilitary forces began almost exactly two years ago.

The UN said killings were continuing at two large displacement camps, including of the entire medical staff of Relief International, which was operating the only remaining clinic inside Zamzam camp. RSF forces were said to be burning buildings throughout Zamzam on Sunday, claiming they were seeking Sudanese government fighters hiding in the camps.

The US has condemned both sides in the war, saying the RSF has committed genocide in Darfur and that the army has attacked civilians.

The conflict has essentially divided Sudan in two, with the army holding sway in the north and east while the RSF controls most of Darfur and parts of the south.

The war has killed tens of thousands, uprooted more than 12 million and created what the International Rescue Committee described as “the biggest humanitarian crisis ever recorded”.

The deaths at the weekend put extra pressure on the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, to deliver a decisive response on the issue of civilian protection when he convenes a ministerial conference on Sudan in London on Tuesday. The conference of 20 countries and organisations will inevitably shine a spotlight on the United Arab Emirates, past backers of the RSF, to issue an unambiguous statement of condemnation.

The attacks on Um Kadadah, about 180km (112 miles) east of El Fasher, came one day after RSF fighters said they had taken the town from army forces. The victims appeared to be targeted because of their ethnicity.

Lammy tweeted: “Shocking reports are emerging from El Fasher, Darfur, where indiscriminate RSF attacks have killed civilians, including aid workers. This gives added urgency to Tuesday’s Sudan conference in London with international partners. All sides must commit to protection of civilians.”

The UN’s resident and humanitarian coordinator in Sudan, Clementine Nkweta-Salami, said she was “appalled and gravely alarmed by reports emerging from Zamzam and Abu Shouk displacement camps as well as El Fasher town in North Darfur”. The two camps protect as many as 700,000 civilians displaced by previous violence and famine.

The Yale School of Public Health’s Humanitarian Research Lab said it had observed that “arson attacks have burned multiple structures and significant areas of the Zamzam camp in the centre, south and south-east portions of the camp”.

The UN reported that the RSF had launched coordinated ground and air attacks on the camps and El Fasher from multiple directions on 11 April, triggering intense clashes and resulting in catastrophic consequences for civilians.

The UN said more than 100 people, including more than 20 children, were feared dead, including nine Relief International personnel. The Sudanese army said more than 70 people had been killed in El Fasher alone. The precise death toll was unverifiable due to deliberate internet shutdowns implemented by the RSF.

Last month the army recaptured the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, about 1,000km (600 miles) to the east.

Adam Regal, a spokesperson for the General Coordination for Refugees and Displaced in Darfur, said Zamzam and Abou Shouk remained under artillery shelling and an assault by RSF armed vehicles on Sunday.

Relief International said of the loss of its staff: “We understand this was a targeted attack on all health infrastructure in the region to prevent access to healthcare for internally displaced people. We are horrified that one of our clinics was also part of this attack – along with other health facilities in El Fasher.”

Both the Biden and Trump administrations in the US have said the RSF has committed genocide in Darfur, and that the army has attacked civilians. The Sudanese government last week took the UAE to the international court of justice, the UN’s top court, claiming the UAE was complicit in genocide.

Kate Ferguson, a co-director of Protection Approaches, said: “It appears that the RSF is attacking Zamzam, Abu Shouk and El Fasher simultaneously for the first time, including a ground assault on Zamzam. This is a significant escalation in violence against civilians in the North Darfur region and requires immediate diplomatic response.”

She said she feared such “a coordinated military effort by the RSF would represent the beginning of the assault we have all so long feared – including further acts of genocide and crimes against humanity – and should trigger all emergency diplomatic and other responses.”

She added: “In hosting the conference on Tuesday, Lammy holds the heavy responsibility of securing a collective response to the appalling atrocities committed yesterday and this weekend. It is a tough but rare opportunity to bring international commitment to protect civilians in Sudan from strong words to resolute action.

“This means sincerely confronting those backing and enabling atrocity crimes, and establishing a serious senior coalition willing to advance at pace the political and technical solutions necessary to halt genocide, crimes against humanity, war and famine.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/13/sudans-rsf-kills-civilians-in-attacks-on-darfur-refugee-camps,1
Coup leader favourite in presidential race as Gabon goes to the polls,"An estimated 1 million Gabonese citizens head to the polls on Saturday to vote in the country’s first presidential election since an August 2023 coup ended the 55-year Bongo family dynasty. For Brice Nguema, the junta leader turned civilian head of state, it could be a chance to cement his democratic credentials.

Last November, 860,000 registered voters approved a referendum for a new constitution with two seven-year presidential terms and an amnesty for participants in the removal of Ali Bongo, who had succeeded his father in 2009. Officials are yet to release data on the updated voters’ register but previously said they expected an additional 300,000 new registrations, including from those who have recently come of age.

Observer missions are already in place, including that of an eight-person Commonwealth team led by Danny Faure, a former president of Seychelles.

Four independents are in the race for president but analysts say the favourite is Nguema. Since coming to power, 50-year-old Nguema has styled himself as an anti-corruption crusader who had to resort to a coup to end an unpopular family dynasty, despite also being a cousin to Bongo. In October 2023, he made headlines for reportedly refusing to draw a salary for the presidency.

Those announcements drew plaudits in the oil-rich central African state where a third of the 2.3 million people live in poverty.

“Gabonese tell themselves that someone who works with this much ardour is trying to transform things,” Joseph Tonda, a sociologist at Omar Bongo University in Libreville, told Reuters news agency earlier this month.

But like his cousin, Nguema has maintained close ties with France even in the face of high anti-French sentiments in the region. And a 2020 investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) revealed multimillion-dollar assets abroad, believed to be the proceeds of embezzlement during his time in the presidential guard.

His closest challenger is the ex-prime minister Alain Claude Bilie By Nze, who was in government until the coup. Nze, who has campaigned as a pragmatic veteran seeking to create jobs and reduce the size of government, has also tried to dissociate himself from the old guard.

Other candidates include the former tax official Joseph Lapensée Essingone and Stéphane Germain Iloko, previously a member of the former ruling Gabonese Democratic party (PDG).

The coup, one of a string of military takeovers in west and central Africa between 2020 and 2023, was well received in Gabon, with many citizens trooping to the streets of Port Gentil and Libreville, its two biggest cities.

But there are concerns that Nguema may also be using the same Bongo playbook of muzzling dissent.

In particular, the Union for Democracy and Social Integration (UDIS) party – once allied with the former ruling party – has accused the administration of targeting its exiled leader, Hervé Patrick Opiangah, who is the subject of a criminal investigation for alleged incest and undermining state security.

Opiangah, 54, a former mining minister, has proclaimed his innocence and filed a complaint with the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights.

Edmond Ngadi, a UDIS spokesperson who has called the matter a “state conspiracy”, said Opiangah was being targeted for mobilising for people to vote no during the 16 November referendum.

“This is a blatant violation of human rights … he is a Gabonese citizen who simply asks to return to his country safely to be able to secure his family, secure his businesses and also participate in the life of his country,” Ngadi said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/11/coup-leader-brice-nguema-favourite-in-presidential-race-as-gabon-goes-to-the-polls,1
Zimbabwe starts compensating white farmers 25 years after land seizures,"Zimbabwe has started to make compensation payments to white former farm owners, 25 years after Robert Mugabe’s government began confiscating land.

The government paid $3.1m (£2.3m) to a “first batch” of 378 farms, the ministry of finance said in a statement on Wednesday, the first payout under a 2020 agreement to pay $3.5bn in compensation.

The remainder of the $311m due to this group of farmers will be paid in US dollar-denominated treasury bonds with two- to 10-year maturities and interest of 2%. That is much lower than the current yield on a two-year US treasury bond of about 3.8%.

Zimbabwe’s finance minister, Mthuli Ncube, said: “The payments will continue. We are very serious about this.”

Mugabe’s government seized more than 4,000 mostly white-owned farms, often violently, from about the year 2000 to redistribute to black people in what it claimed was restitution for the dispossession of British colonial rule.

However, Mugabe and his cronies took nearly 40% of the 14m hectares (about 35m acres) confiscated for themselves, according to a 2010 investigation by a local news outlet, ZimOnline. Agricultural production, which had accounted for 40% of exports, plunged and the economy collapsed, with hyperinflation reaching a staggering 500bn% in 2008.

Zimbabwe cannot borrow from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund as it has been in arrears since 2000 and 2001, respectively. Government debt was $21bn late last year, about half of which was arrears and penalties.

The compensation payments to the displaced farmers are one of the requirements of international lenders to start a debt restructuring process with Zimbabwe, including a new IMF programme.

Andrew Pascoe, who signed the 2020 compensation deal while head of the Commercial Farmers’ Union, confirmed the first payments had been received on 24 March and thanked Zimbabwe’s government, in comments included in the ministry of finance statement. He said: “We are extremely grateful.”

However, Tony Hawkins, a retired University of Zimbabwe economics professor, called the payments a “publicity stunt”, noting that the US could block an IMF programme. A US law “restricts US support for multilateral financing to Zimbabwe until Zimbabwe makes concrete governance and economic reforms”, according to the US state department.

Of using government bonds to pay farmers, Hawkins said: “We continue to accumulate arrears because we are unable to service our foreign debt, so we can’t really afford to take on new debt commitments … It’s derisory, the more you look at it.”

About 1,000 former farmers had signed up for compensation, said Harry Orphanides, one of Pascoe’s co-negotiators. He said: “Look, it’s not a perfect deal. But there was no other alternative.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/11/zimbabwe-starts-compensating-white-farmers-25-years-after-land-seizures,1
Weather tracker: early heatwave sweeps northern India,"Northern India has been experiencing early extreme heat this week as temperatures topped 40C (104F), including in the capital, New Delhi.

Hot weather across the north-west of the country peaked on Tuesday as Barmer, a city in the state of Rajasthan, reached 46.4C – more than 6C above the average maximum in April.

New Delhi rose to 40.3C on Wednesday, surpassing 40C for the first time this year. Farther south, Jaipur exceeded 40C for five consecutive days from Sunday, with a maximum temperature of 43C recorded on Wednesday, almost 5C above the average April high.

The Indian meteorology bureau said last week that most parts of the country would experience an intense heatwave this summer, with two to four more such days than normal.

The extreme early heat this week triggered severe thunderstorms across Bihar, including in Patna. At least 19 people have died in the past two days amid frequent lightning, significant hail and strong winds.

There was extensive damage to crops – including wheat, mango and lychee – weeks before the harvest. Stormy conditions are likely to persist across Bihar until Saturday, owing to a low-pressure system over the west-central Bay of Bengal.

Meanwhile, parts of east Africa are experiencing higher-than-average temperatures, which could approach the April record.

In Mali, the national meteorological agency issued an extreme weather warning covering the entire country from Wednesday to Sunday. Maximum temperatures are expected to reach 40-47C for at least three consecutive days.

This is comparable to average temperatures during the height of summer in June and July, whereas April averages tend to be 38-40C. People have been advised to stay indoors during the hottest hours, wear light-coloured clothing, eat foods with high quantities of liquid and drink plenty of water.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/11/weather-tracker-early-heatwave-sweeps-northern-india,1
Ecuador’s Noboa re-elected in presidential vote seen as test of his ‘war on drugs’,"In an election seen as a referendum on his “war on drugs”, Ecuador’s right-wing president, Daniel Noboa, won Sunday’s presidential runoff, defeating leftist candidate Luisa González.

With 97% of ballots counted, the incumbent had secured 55.65% of the vote, compared to 44.35% for the former congresswoman.

The National Electoral Council (CNE) stated that the margin “marks an irreversible trend,” effectively recognising Noboa’s victory.

In a speech shortly after the announcement, Noboa, called it a “historic victory”.

“A victory by more than 10 points, a victory by over a million votes, leaving no doubt about who the winner is,” he told his supporters.

González, meanwhile, said she would not accept the results. “We will request a recount and for the ballot boxes to be opened,” she told her supporters, while the crowd shouted “fraud”.

International observers from the European Union and the Organization of American States monitored the vote, but their official reports have yet to be released. Throughout the day, the heads of both missions said the atmosphere was one of “normality”.

The margin of victory – more than 1.1m votes – was significantly larger than suggested by opinion polls, which had indicated a technical tie, as well as the result of the first round in February, when Noboa had beaten González by just 16,746 votes (0.17%).

Noboa’s term has been defined by an “internal armed conflict” he declared in January 2024 against drug trafficking gangs.

He placed the armed forces at the centre of his mano dura (iron fist) offensive, which initially led to a drop in crime – soon followed by a surge in reports of human rights violations and a return to previous levels of violence.

Once one of the safest countries in Latin America, Ecuador registered the highest homicide rate in the region in 2024.

The population also faced an energy crisis that led to scheduled blackouts of up to 14 hours, a shrinking GDP, and rising poverty levels – yet the incumbent emerged victorious.

The heir to a banana fortune will now serve a full term in office – until 2029 – as his current 17 months in power were to complete the term of former president Guillermo Lasso, who dissolved Congress and stepped down to avoid impeachment.

In the 2023 snap election, Noboa also defeated González in the runoff but by a much narrower margin: 51.83% to 48.17%.

Voting is compulsory in Ecuador, and, according to the National Electoral Council, 83.76% of eligible voters turned out.

One move by Noboa on the eve of the election sparked controversy.

Less than 24 hours before polls opened, the president signed a decree declaring a 60-day state of emergency – something that has been a frequent feature of his presidency – suspending the right to freedom of assembly and authorising warrantless searches.

The president claimed there was a “serious internal disturbance” in light of rising violence levels, but the decision was sharply criticised by the opposition, Indigenous movements and even Congress.

Despite once again coming close to becoming the first female president in Ecuador’s history, González’s competitiveness had more to do with her political patron: former leftist president Rafael Correa, who governed Ecuador from 2007 to 2017.

A split between Correístas – the former president’s supporters, such as González – and anti-Correístas has since polarised Ecuador. Correa has lived in Belgium since leaving office and was convicted by an Ecuadorian court in 2020 for corruption during his presidency.

In the speech in which she said she would not recognise the election result, González claimed that none of the opinion polls showed such a large margin and that Noboa had abused his power by not stepping down from office to run, as required by law.

“This is a dictatorship, and this is the biggest electoral fraud that we, the Ecuadorians, are witnessing,” she said.

To the Ecuadorian outlet Primicias, Noboa said it was regrettable that González would not accept defeat. “I find it regrettable that, with an 11- or 12-point difference, she’s still trying to somehow question the will of the Ecuadorian people. The Ecuadorians have already spoken, and now it’s time to get to work starting tomorrow,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/14/ecuador-presidential-election-daniel-noboa,1
"US deports 10 more alleged gang members to El Salvador, says Rubio","The US has deported another 10 people that it alleges are gang members to El Salvador, secretary of state Marco Rubio said on Sunday, a day before that country’s president is due to visit the White House.

“Last night, another 10 criminals from the MS-13 and Tren de Aragua Foreign Terrorist Organizations arrived in El Salvador,” Rubio said in an X/Twitter post.

Last night, another 10 criminals from the MS-13 and Tren de Aragua Foreign Terrorist Organizations arrived in El Salvador.



The alliance between @POTUS and President @nayibbukele has become an example for security and prosperity in our hemisphere. — Secretary Marco Rubio (@SecRubio) April 13, 2025

The alliance between Donald Trump and El Salvador president Nayib Bukele “has become an example for security and prosperity in our hemisphere”, Rubio added. The US president is due to meet Bukele at the White House on Monday.

It comes as US officials said in court filings on Sunday that they were not obliged to help a Maryland resident get out of prison in El Salvador after he was erroneously deported, despite a supreme court ruling directing the government to “facilitate” his return to the US.

Attorneys for the Trump administration said the high court’s order to “facilitate” the return of Abrego García, 29, meant they should “remove any domestic obstacles that would otherwise impede the alien’s ability to return here”, not help extract him from El Salvador.

The Trump administration has acknowledged that García, a Salvadoran migrant who was living in Maryland and has had a work permit since 2019, was deported in March in violation of an immigration judge’s order blocking his removal to El Salvador. Trump administration lawyers were able to confirm on Saturday that García remains confined in a notorious prison in El Salvador.

Trump said on Saturday he was looking forward to meeting Bukele and praised him for taking “enemy aliens” from the United States. He said the two countries were working closely to “eradicate terrorist organizations”.

Administration officials have repeatedly made public statements alleging that detained immigrants are gang members that they have not backed up in court.

The Trump administration has deported hundreds of Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.

Lawyers and relatives of the migrants held in El Salvador say they are not gang members and had no opportunity to contest the US government assertion that they were. The Trump administration says it vetted migrants to ensure they belonged to Tren de Aragua, which it labels a terrorist organization.

The deportations have been challenged in federal court. The US supreme court said the US government must give sufficient notice to immigrant detainees to allow them to contest their deportations. It did not say how those already in El Salvador could seek judicial review of their removals.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/13/us-deportations-el-salvador-marco-rubio,1
Ecuador to deliver verdict on ‘war on drugs’ in knife-edge presidential runoff,"Ecuadorians go to the polls on Sunday in a vote seen as a referendum on a “war on drugs” offensive that has led to numerous human rights violations, as the incumbent Daniel Noboa faces the leftist Luisa González in a tightly contested runoff.

Noboa, 37, edged out González, 47, in the first round in February by just 16,746 votes (0.17%) from a 13.7 million electorate.

Polls now indicate a statistical tie in the rematch of Ecuador’s 2023 runoff, when the then little-known heir to a banana fortune unexpectedly won a snap election to complete the term of former president Guillermo Lasso, who had dissolved Congress and stepped down to avoid impeachment.

In his first months in office, Noboa declared an “internal armed conflict” and placed the armed forces at the centre of his mano dura (iron fist) policy against drug-trafficking gangs.

After an initial drop in crime, reports of human rights violations mounted, and violence levels soon returned to previous highs: Ecuador still has the highest homicide rate in Latin America, and the figures for January and February are the highest on record.

Last month, one of the most violent massacres in the country’s history took place in Socio Vivienda II, an impoverished neighbourhood in north-west Guayaquil, when 22 people were killed in a confrontation between rival gang factions.

“Everything is worse now,” said María, a Socio Vivienda II resident who asked not to be identified by her full name. “We’ve been abandoned by the state and left without the rule of law,” she said, adding that dozens of residents still had not been able to return home because of ongoing fighting.

But violence is far from the only issue affecting Noboa’s popularity. An energy crisis led to scheduled blackouts of up to 14 hours, GDP fell by 1.5% and the poverty rate rose from 26% to 28% between 2023 and 2024.

“Life has become unbearable,” said María. “You only eat once a day, and then you have to save a little for the afternoon so the children have something to eat. We just want to live with dignity,” she added.

In a YouGov survey commissioned by the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR), 61% of respondents said their economic situation and personal security had not improved since Noboa took office.

“The economy is not doing better, security is not doing better, people are facing blackouts, and they’re also witnessing a deterioration of the rule of law, with growing disregard for the constitution,” said Pedro Labayen Herrera, a researcher at CEPR specialising in Ecuador.

The political analyst Matías Abad Merchán said: “Despite Noboa having been in power for a short time, a small anti-Noboa segment of the electorate has indeed emerged – one that genuinely feels the president displays certain authoritarian tendencies.”

The president refused to step down during the electoral campaign period, as required by the constitution.

He also sparked an unprecedented diplomatic crisis by ordering police and military forces to storm the Mexican embassy in Quito to arrest Jorge Glas, once a vice-president under the former leftist president Rafael Correa.

Correa – who has lived in Belgium since leaving office and was convicted in 2020 by an Ecuadorian court for corruption during his presidency – is González’s political patron.

Noboa, on the other hand, has made efforts to showcase support from the US president: the Ecuadorian leader left his country in the middle of the campaign to travel to Florida, where he posed for a photo with Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach.

The incumbent has become embroiled in several controversies in the race’s final stretch.

He announced a “strategic alliance” with Erik Prince – the Trump-aligned founder of the controversial private military firm Blackwater – to supposedly reinforce his “war” on crime.

In early April, the Brazilian investigative outlet Pública revealed that at least three times cocaine has been found hidden in banana containers being sent to Europe by a company in which Noboa and his brother are the majority shareholders.

During a presidential debate, Noboa denied any wrongdoing and said that the family’s banana company was cooperating with investigators.

After the first round, Noboa alleged – without providing evidence – that there had been “irregularities”, a claim promptly rejected by observers from the European Union and the Organization of American States. For the runoff, he stated that he would only accept defeat “if there was no indication of fraud”.

“So if things don’t go his way, I think there’s a real risk that he won’t accept the results,” said Herrera.

On Wednesday, 14 Democratic members of the US Congress sent a letter to the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, expressing concern that Noboa might not accept the results if he loses: “It’s therefore imperative that you send a clear message to the government of Ecuador and other Ecuadorian leaders emphasising the need for a free, fair and transparent electoral process, and noting that, if electoral observers determine these conditions to be met, the outcome of the election must be respected,” they wrote.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/13/ecuador-presidential-runoff-election-noboa-gonzalez,1
Trump lawyers confirm wrongly deported Maryland man in El Salvador prison,"The Trump administration on Saturday confirmed to a federal judge that a Maryland man who was wrongly deported last month remains confined in a notorious prison in El Salvador.

However, the White House filing did not address the judge’s demands that the administration detail the steps it was taking to return Kilmar Abrego García to the United States. The White House only confirmed that García was under the authority of the El Salvador government.

The administration’s confirmation of García’s location was confirmed to the court by Michael G Kozak, who identified himself in the filing as a “Senior Bureau Official” in the state department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs.

The filing comes one day after a US government attorney struggled in a hearing to provide the US district judge Paula Xinis with any information about García’s whereabouts. Xinis issued an order after Friday’s hearing requiring the administration to disclose García’s “current physical location and custodial status” and “what steps, if any, Defendants have taken (and) will take, and when, to facilitate” his return.

“It is my understanding based on official reporting from our Embassy in San Salvador that Abrego García is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador,” Kozak’s statement said. “He is alive and secure in that facility. He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador.”

Kozak’s statement did not address the judge’s latter requirements.

Xinis was exasperated Friday with the government’s lack of information.

“Where is he and under whose authority?” the judge asked in the hearing. “I’m not asking for state secrets. All I know is that he’s not here. The government was prohibited from sending him to El Salvador, and now I’m asking a very simple question: Where is he?”

The US supreme court on Thursday upheld the judge’s order to facilitate Abrego García’s return to the US, after Abrego García and his family filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of his summary deportation on 15 March.

Abrego García has had a US work permit since 2019 but was stopped and detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers on 12 March and questioned about alleged gang affiliation. He was deported on one of three high-profile deportation flights to El Salvador made up chiefly of Venezuelans whom the government accuses of being gang members and whom it assumed special powers to expel without a hearing.

Abrego García’s wife, US citizen Jennifer Vásquez Sura, has not been able to speak to him since he was flown to his native El Salvador last month and imprisoned. She has been rallying outside court and has urged their supporters to keep fighting for him “and all the Kilmars out there whose stories are still waiting to be heard”.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/12/kilmar-abrego-garcia-wrongly-deported,1
Jamaican reggae artist Max Romeo dies aged 80,"Max Romeo, the influential Jamaican reggae artist best known for tracks such as Chase the Devil and War Ina Babylon, has died at the age of 80.

The singer, known to his family and friends as Maxie Smith, died after heart complications in Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica, on Friday.

Romeo rose to fame in the late 1960s with his provocative hit Wet Dream. Despite being banned by the BBC, the song became a UK Top 10 single and spent 25 weeks in the charts, cementing his legacy as one of the world’s most recognisable reggae voices.

“To hear of his passing is quite shocking,” said Max Romeo’s lawyer, Errol Michael Henry. “He was a perfect gentleman, and a gentle soul. He had great love for his family, and he was a legend in his own right. You couldn’t meet a nicer person – which makes the loss more difficult.”

Romeo began his career in 1965 as the lead vocalist for the Emotions, before his music became synonymous with the Jamaican social democracy movement of the 1970s. His song Let the Power Fall on I became a ballad for Jamaica’s People’s National party during its successful 1972 election campaign.

His 1976 album War Ina Babylon, released on Island Records and backed by Jamaican band the Upsetters, is widely regarded as a classic of the roots reggae era. It featured Chase the Devil, a song that has since been sampled by artists across genres, including the Prodigy and Kanye West.

Romeo later moved to New York in 1978, where he co-wrote and starred in the musical Reggae, while he went on to perform backing vocals on the Rolling Stones’ track Dance on their Emotional Rescue album.",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/apr/12/jamaican-reggae-artist-max-romeo-dies-aged-80,1
"Ted Kotcheff, director of First Blood, Weekend at Bernie’s and Wake in Fright, dies aged 94","Ted Kotcheff, the prolific Canadian director of films including First Blood, Weekend at Bernie’s, Wake in Fright and The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz, has died aged 94. His daughter Kate Kotcheff told the Canadian Press that he had died of heart failure on Thursday in Nuevo Vallarta, Mexico, where he lived. His son Thomas said: “He died of old age, peacefully, and surrounded by loved ones.”

In an amazingly varied career, Kotcheff’s work ranged from hardhitting TV plays and low-budget features in the UK, to hit Hollywood comedies and prestige-laden award-winners and cult films. Kate Kotcheff said: “He was an amazing storyteller. He was an incredible, larger than life character [and] he was a director who could turn his hand to anything.”

The son of Bulgarian/Macedonian immigrants to Canada, Kotcheff was born in 1931 in Toronto, and raised in the city’s Cabbagetown district. After earning a degree in English literature from Toronto University, Kotcheff joined the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in the early 1950s, part of a remarkable generation that included Norman Jewison, Arthur Hiller, Sidney J Furie and Alvin Rakoff. Like them, he felt he had to move away to further his career, and Kotcheff came to London in 1957 and began making TV plays for strands including Hour of Mystery, Armchair Theatre and ITV Playhouse. These included an adaptation of Eugene O’Neill’s Emperor Jones in 1958, written by Terry Southern and starring Kenneth Spencer and Harry H Corbett, No Trams to Lime Street in 1959, written by Alun Owen, and – infamously – Underground in 1958, in which actor Gareth Jones collapsed and died during a live transmission.

Kotcheff moved into features in the early 60s, making his debut with the 1962 comedy Tiara Tahiti, starring James Mason and John Mills, following it up with Life at the Top, the sequel to hit kitchen sink drama Room at the Top, in 1965, and the race-issue drama Two Gentlemen Sharing in 1969. In the same period Kotcheff also directed the original production of Lionel Bart’s celebrated musical Maggie May, which premiered in 1964. Kotcheff continued to work in TV, directing Ingrid Bergman in an adaptation of Jean Cocteau’s La Voix Humaine in 1967, and achieving perhaps his high point with a contribution to Play for Today in 1971: Edna the Inebriate Woman, starring Patricia Hayes as a homeless alcoholic.

However his career had taken an unexpected detour in the same year with the cult Australian film Wake in Fright, for which he was offered the job to direct despite never having visited the country. Despite being poorly received in its home country due to its uncompromising depiction of a brutally cruel Australian outback, including notorious scenes of a kangaroo hunt, Wake in Fright was selected for the Cannes film festival and went on to become celebrated as a landmark film, both as part of the Australian new wave of the 1970s and as a pioneering entry in the “Ozploitation” subgenre.

In 1974 Kotcheff finally realised his ambition of making a successful Canadian feature film with The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz; starring Richard Dreyfuss, it was adapted from a novel by his friend (and former housemate in London) Mordecai Richler, with whom he had worked on a string of British productions – including an Armchair Theatre adaptation of Duddy Kravitz in 1961. The film won the Golden Bear at the Berlin film festival and was a major commercial success in Canada.

As a result, Hollywood took notice and Kotcheff was hired to make satirical comedy Fun with Dick and Jane, starring George Segal and Jane Fonda as a successful married couple who turn to crime after Segal is fired. It was a hit on its release in 1977, and Kotcheff followed it up with another Segal comedy Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe? and Nick Nolte American football film North Dallas Forty.

Kotcheff then released arguably his most influential film: the Sylvester Stallone action film First Blood, which had numerous directors and lead actors attached to it before Kotcheff offered the role to Stallone and production got underway in 1981. A depiction of an emotionally embattled Vietnam veteran, First Blood was a sizeable hit and spawned two sequels, including Rambo: First Blood Part II which became a career-defining success for Stallone in 1985. Kotcheff had another big success at the end of the decade: the dead-body comedy Weekend at Bernie’s, starring Andrew McCarthy.

After the failure of the Tom Selleck comedy Folks! in 1992, Kotcheff returned to TV, and in 2000 joined the long running crime show Law & Order: Special Victims Unit as executive producer and occasional director, where he remained for 12 seasons.

Sky-high US-China tariffs are a mutual trade embargo that will hurt both sides,"Sky-high tariffs that now hang heavily over US-China trade mean, effectively, that they have declared a trade embargo on each other, normally an act of war. The economic consequences for both will hurt.

The US’s $150bn (£113bn) or so of exports to China will fall away quickly, while China’s $440bn worth of exports to the US may drop by up to 75% over the next 18 months, unless some sort of negotiation happens. No one will be spared the effects.

The consequences could tip the US into a mild recession this summer, and are undermining one of the country’s principal weapons, namely the power, leverage and reach of its financial system. The leading indicators of consumer confidence, inflation, and capital spending are all flashing warning signs. It is also an ill wind that last week brought both rising bond yields in the US Treasury market and a falling dollar.

This trade war is distinctly unwelcome for the Chinese Communist party, which only last month revealed its alarm at the underlying fragility of China’s economy. Chinese exports were on fire last year, accounting for half of its growth and expanding three times as fast as world trade. The country ran a $2tn trade surplus in manufactured goods. The government can ill-afford a trade torpedo as it tries to stabilise its beleaguered property sector, along with debt and asset deflation in local governments, and finance.

Trade negotiations would not be a panacea for the fundamental issues that divide these two powers, but they might … at least keep dialogue going.

Donald Trump and Xi Jinping boast resilience and determination, but have reasons to pull back, if not call off, the trade dogs of war. The chances of immediate rapprochement look poor, but not hopeless. China’s ministry of commerce said over the weekend it would ignore future US escalation. The US announced tariff exemptions for smartphones, chips, and electronic equipment, though only temporarily. Some sort of eventual transactional “deal” – some rollback of high tariffs, maybe TikTok, other issues – still seems probable.

The US wants to contain and decouple from China, but has not as yet exercised some of its more potent financial and export control weapons. China has been pursuing decoupling under the slogan of self-reliance for a long time, and if Xi wanted to, he could shut down any chance of talks by devaluing the yuan much more aggressively, and targeting a swathe of US firms.

Trade negotiations would not be a panacea for the fundamental issues that divide these two powers, but they might buy some time and at least keep dialogue going.

Implications for the rest of the world were hinted at, curiously, by the crisis surrounding British Steel and its Chinese owner, Jingye Group. Seemingly a world away, there is though an important connection. In the firm’s UK and French plants, Jingye has been able to make, finish and export steel, branding it “Made in UK” and so avoid steel tariffs and other trade restrictions when selling to the EU and US.

In addition to using investment in this way, China has also had growing recourse to “trans-shipment”, or the practice of using third countries, especially in Asia, such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and India, and also Mexico, to bypass sanctions and trade barriers, and obfuscate country of origin. About a quarter of all China’s exports are now trans-shipped. US so-called “reciprocal tariffs” on more than 100 countries, with the top tariffs applying in Asia, were designed partly to stop this from happening.

The recently announced 90-day pause in these tariffs (ex-China) were both a reaction to stabilise the US’s battered financial markets, but also a window in which the US hopes that several important countries will negotiate new trade arrangements with Washington, possibly including restrictions on trade and investment with China.

The EU and the UK appear now in “pause” mode with respect to retaliation, formal channels have opened with Japan and South Korea, and the US reports encouraging signals from Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and India, for example. It is a complicated picture. Many countries are highly integrated into China’s trading system, but many have also implemented trade measures against China to protect their own manufacturing, jobs and communities. No one wants to lose access to the US consumer market, which is 30% of the world total. China’s mercantilist character means it will not and cannot fill the gap, and wants only to expand its exports.

The manner in which the Trump administration is prosecuting this trade war is chaotic and often barely thought out. Yet, it is important not to lose sight of the reason that trade conflict has erupted in the first place, and that is as reaction to China’s surging trade surplus. This comes from a political system that gives exceptionally large support to its companies, distorts competition, restricts market access and imposes real economic costs on other nations.

"‘No winners’ in a trade war, says China’s Xi as he heads to Vietnam on charm offensive","The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, warned there would be “no winners” in a trade war and that protectionism “leads nowhere”, as he began a three-nation trip to south-east Asia, starting in Vietnam on Monday.

Xi’s tour, which started in Hanoi, also includes rare visits to Malaysia and Cambodia and will seek to strengthen ties with China’s closest neighbours amid a trade war that has sent shock waves through global markets.

Writing in an article published in Vietnam’s Nhân Dân newspaper on Monday, Xi urged Vietnam to “resolutely safeguard the multilateral trading system, stable global industrial and supply chains, and open and cooperative international environment”, Beijing’s Xinhua news agency said.

He added that a “trade war and tariff war will produce no winner, and protectionism will lead nowhere”.

It is expected Xi’s visit will seek to present China as a reliable partner, in contrast to Washington, which imposed – then suspended – tariffs of more than 40% on some countries in south-east Asia, an export-reliant region.

Officials in Vietnam, a manufacturing powerhouse, were shocked when the country was hit with a tariff of 46%, even after various efforts to appease the Trump administration. The tariff, which has been paused, threatens to devastate the country’s ambitious economic growth plan.

Xi’s visit was reportedly planned prior to Trump’s tariff announcement. During meetings Vietnam and China will sign about 40 agreements across different sectors, Vietnam’s deputy prime minister, Bùi Thanh Sơn, said on Saturday. It is expected this will include cooperation to develop Vietnam’s railway network.

Vietnam’s leader, Tô Lâm, wrote in an article published in state media on Monday that Hanoi wanted to boost cooperation in defence, security and infrastructure, especially on rail links.

Xi’s visit will probably form part of an effort to prevent economic encirclement by the US and in the region, said Dr Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow at the Vietnam studies programme of the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, who cited reports that Washington would prioritise trade negotiations with countries such as Vietnam, Japan, South Korea and India.

For Vietnam, Giang added, Xi’s visit presented “a risk and an opportunity”.

Vietnam, and many other south-east Asian countries, are trying to maintain a delicate balancing act between the US and China. The US is Vietnam’s main export market, with US exports accounting for 30% of Vietnam’s GDP. However, China is Vietnam’s top import source, which it relies on for raw materials and other supplies that will be used to produce exports destined for the US.

Vietnam has traditionally sought to avoid taking sides between the US and China and will want to avoid antagonising either party, especially as it tries to persuade Washington to lower tariffs.

Vietnam is vulnerable to Washington’s tariffs because its trade surplus with the US has grown rapidly over recent years to more than $123bn (£94bn), fuelled in part by companies relocating production to Vietnam to avoid tariffs imposed on China by the last Trump administration.

Hanoi is preparing to crack down on Chinese goods being shipped from its territory to the US, in an effort to appease Washington, according to a Reuters report, and to tighten controls on sensitive exports to China. It has also made other concessions, including offering to remove all tariffs on US imports and promising to buy more US goods.

Cambodia and Malaysia, which face tariffs of 49% and 24% respectively, are also seeking to negotiate with Donald Trump, while China has previously vowed to “fight until the end” if the US continued to escalate the trade war.

Hanoi will want to avoid being seen as moving too close to Beijing during Xi’s visit, given the tension between China and Washington, said Giang, but he added that China may be able to offer a “life-saving opportunity for Vietnamese economy … at least in the short run”.

This could include a commitment from China not to export its excess capacity to Vietnam. Across many south-east Asian countries there is concern that tariffs imposed on China by the US will worsen a problem of cheap Chinese goods overwhelming domestic industries. China could also increase its imports from south-east Asia, including in areas such as agriculture.

A willingness to pursue peaceful solutions to the dispute in the South China Sea, where Beijing and several south-east Asian countries have overlapping claims, would also improve perceptions of China in the region, added Giang.

“Now we are viewing the US as a global disruptor – that presents China a golden opportunity to be a responsible stakeholder in the region. And if they can do so, I think more and more south-east Asian countries will eventually move closer to China,” Giang said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/14/no-winners-in-a-trade-war-proclaims-chinas-xi-as-he-heads-to-vietnam-on-charm-offensive,1
‘The sky won’t fall’: China plays down Trump tariff risks as stock markets rally,"China has played down the risk of damage to its exports from Donald Trump’s tariffs, with an official saying the “the sky won’t fall”, as stock markets rose on Monday amid signs of a retreat on electronics restrictions.

The world’s second-largest economy has diversified its trade away from the US in recent years, according to Lyu Daliang, a customs administration spokesperson, in comments reported by state-owned agency Xinhua.

China has retaliated forcefully to Washington’s tariffs, with 125% levies on US imports against the US’s total of 145% border taxes on goods moving the other way. The trade war has prompted turmoil on financial markets since Trump first revealed tariffs on every country in the world on 2 April. Since then he has partly retreated on the highest levies on most trading partners for at least 90 days, but has doubled down in his spat with China.

The White House offered further relief over the weekend with an exemption from the steepest tariffs for electronics including smartphones, laptops and semiconductors. Trump officials later appeared to walk that back with the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, saying such devices would be “included in the semiconductor tariffs which are coming in probably a month or two”.

Trump said on Sunday night on his social network, Truth Social, that “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’”, highlighting that smartphones are still subject to 20% levies and suggesting they could still rise higher.

However, investors on Monday appeared unconvinced by Trump’s attempts to play down the retreat. Japan’s Nikkei gained 1.2% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose by 2.2% and the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges climbed by 0.8% and 1.2%, respectively. European stock market indices also jumped in opening trades, with London’s FTSE 100 up by 1.6%, Germany’s Dax up 2.2%, and France’s Cac 40 up 2%.

“The sky won’t fall” for Chinese exports,” China’s Lyu said. “These efforts have not only supported our partners’ development but also enhanced our own resilience”.

The customs report also played up China’s “vast domestic market”, and said “the country will turn domestic certainty into a buffer against global volatility”. China has increasingly tried to stimulate private consumption.

China’s president, Xi Jinping, on Monday criticised the US tariffs, during a visit to Vietnam. Vietnam has in recent decades grown to become the eighth largest source of goods for US consumers, but it is facing the threat of 46% tariffs when Trump’s 90-day pause expires.

In an article in a Vietnamese newspaper, Xi said that a “trade war and tariff war will produce no winner, and protectionism will lead nowhere”.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/14/the-sky-wont-fall-china-plays-down-trump-tariff-risks,1
UK MP refused entry to Hong Kong accuses China of ‘hidden blacklist’,"A Liberal Democrat MP refused entry to Hong Kong to see her young grandson has said her experience should be “a wake-up call for any parliamentarian”, given that it seems to show China holds a secret list of banned politicians.

Wera Hobhouse, who was turned back by officials on Thursday, said she was given no explanation as to why this happened, and could only assume that it was because she had spoken out about rights abuses by China.

Speaking earlier on Monday, the Treasury minister James Murray said Douglas Alexander, the trade minister who is currently in China on a visit, had raised the matter with Chinese authorities.

Hobhouse told Sky News that after she and her husband arrived, he was quickly given permission to stay but that she was asked to step aside. The couple’s son, a university academic, lives in Hong Kong, and they were visiting to see their three-month-old grandson.

“And at the end of about three hours, my husband was told he was free to go but I was denied entry, and I was going to go back on the next plane home,” Hobhouse said.

The Bath MP said that while she tried to be “cooperative and friendly” in the expectation she would eventually be allowed in, on being told she could not, she “slightly lost it” and demanded an explanation, but was told only: “We are so sorry, Madam, we understand.”

She said: “No explanation was given to me, ever. And this is what is so chilling, and should really be a wake-up call for any parliamentarian, because I had no warning that I was on the blacklist.”

China has in the past publicly banned several British MPs from entering the country, including Iain Duncan Smith and Nusrat Ghani who, like Hobhouse, are members of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (Ipac).

Ipac is an international group of politicians that scrutinises Beijing’s approach to human rights and has criticised the crackdown on free speech in Hong Kong.

Hobhouse said her apparent presence on “a sort of hidden blacklist” appeared likely to be connected to her membership of Ipac.

“I’m a member of Ipac,” she said. “Ipac is watching the human rights adherence, or not, of the Chinese Communist party, but I’m not more outspoken than other MPs about criticising the Chinese Communist party.

“Therefore anybody who ultimately is seen as standing up for freedom, democracy and human rights should feel that they are going to be targeted by the Chinese authorities. And that is really, really chilling.”

Asked how she felt personally about not being able to see her grandchild, Hobhouse said it was “depressing”. She said: “There are many, many more tragedies that are far, far worse, but I am sad.”

Asked about Hobhouse’s case by Sky, Murray said: “We are very concerned about this. We need to find out exactly what happened. And I know that the trade minister, Douglas Alexander, who is in China at the moment, has raised this with authorities there.

“Clearly, it would not be right to prevent a British MP from entering another country purely on the basis of what they had said as a parliamentarian.”",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/apr/14/uk-mp-wera-hobhouse-refused-entry-hong-china-blacklist-human-rights,1
"‘Invasion’ barges, subsea cable cutters and surprise naval drills: how China is testing Donald Trump","In the space of just five weeks, China held live-fire drills on the doorsteps of Australia, Taiwan and Vietnam. It tested new landing barges on ships that could facilitate an amphibious assault on Taiwan. And it unveiled deep-sea cable cutters with the ability to switch off another country’s internet access – a tool no other nation admits to having.

China has been flexing its maritime muscle in the Indo-Pacific to send a message of supremacy to its regional neighbours, experts say. But it’s also testing the thinking of a bigger rival further afield: Donald Trump.

Since Trump took office in January, he and his cabinet members have focused their China strategy on tariffs and have launched an escalating trade war with Beijing. They had been largely silent on China’s growing acts of aggression in the Indo-Pacific’s seas.

That’s starting to change.

On April 1, the US state department condemned Beijing’s “aggressive military activities and rhetoric” in relation to unannounced military drills in the Taiwan Strait, which have become bigger in scale in recent months and are increasingly resembling actual invasion. That came on the heels of a visit to the region by US defence secretary Pete Hegseth, where he assured Japan and the Philippines that America would continue to defend them against China. He clarified the US had not changed its status quo stance on Taiwan, and the Pentagon reiterated China remained the US’ biggest threat.

But the US’s Indo-Pacific allies will want to hear those assurances from Trump, who has not shown his cards on issues like Taiwan. When asked by a journalist in February for his stance, Trump refused to be drawn and has said nothing on Taiwan since. He’s not afraid to diverge from his senior advisers, and his haphazard approach to Ukraine ceasefire talks – and tariffs – gives little confidence the president has a consistent, long-term strategy on any given global affair.

“The Chinese are watching what’s happening with the Trump administration and seeing how far they can push things,” said Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.

And in their testing of Trump, the seas around China are likely to become more restive, Davis said, adding that China will keep ratcheting up its drills in the Taiwan Strait and target countries with which it has territorial disputes, including the Philippines and Japan.

“China will be more willing to impose the risk of casualties on the Philippines through ramming ships and so forth. It might go from using water cannon to something a bit more aggressive,” Davis said. “The goal is to intimidate Manila into accepting China’s interests.”

How heavily involved the US military should get in the Indo-Pacific and how far the US should go to protect Taiwan from China are issues that have divided Trump’s most senior officials, according to a former state department staffer who worked in Trump’s initial weeks in office.

“There are definitely different competing camps that you could liken to a royal court, all competing for the last word and influence with Trump,” the former staffer said. “There is definitely a split over Taiwan policy between traditional NatSec folks like (Marco) Rubio and (Mike) Waltz versus Maga folks.”

But which side Trump is on isn’t clear.

Sam Roggeveen, director of the Lowy Institute’s international security program, said it was known that a faction of the Trump administration wanted to turn away from Europe. “But it’s not at all clear that he agrees with the second part of it – doing more in Asia,” he said.

What is clear from Trump’s posture in Ukraine talks is that he is open to putting deals on trade and major geopolitical issues on the same table. He also has a tendency to change his stance on a subject in a matter of days.

Beijing will be watching to see how Trump sways. If Russia’s Vladimir Putin can strike a grand bargain with Trump by using economic incentives in exchange for Ukrainian land, Beijing may look to do the same with Taiwan.

And that’s causing anxiety among the US’s closest allies in the Indo-Pacific, said Jenny Schuch-Page, managing principal in energy and sustainability with the Washington-based Asia Group. “Even the prospect for a ‘grand bargain’ with China will make countries in South-east Asia wary about how they will fare,” she said.

A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, did not comment on whether Beijing was looking for such a deal, but he said China “deplores” the US’ criticisms of its drills near Taiwan, calling them “a mischaracterisation of the facts and truth and an interference in China’s internal affairs.”

What Trump is likely to focus on is staying competitive with China, which is ahead in areas including artificial intelligence, robotics, electric vehicles and 6G internet.

The lack of a long-term China strategy is problematic, according to Danny Russel, a former US diplomat and vice-president of international security and diplomacy with the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington.

He points to mass firings in the country’s intelligence services, which included laying off dedicated China researchers from the CIA, as a dangerous move in terms of security and the US’s bargaining position in trade talks.

China will probably try to recruit those laid off for its own intelligence gathering on the US, he said. A Reuters report suggests it already is.

“We’re blinding ourselves at a moment when the national security and economic interests of the United States and our allies call for clarity,” Russel said.

How China is using salami slicing tactics against Taiwan – video

The defunding of Radio Free Asia – a sister organisation of Voice of America – is another own-goal, Russel said, cutting off a valuable source of information from China and other countries that are difficult to report from, like North Korea.

“It’s a kind of unilateral disarmament in the information space at a time when China, Russia, and North Korea are ramping up,” Russel said of the cuts. “Why are we voluntarily giving up our best tools of competition? There’s a big difference between belt-tightening and self-sabotage.”

That may become a security concern for countries like Australia, which has a long tradition of sharing intelligence back and forth with the US. China is likely to ramp up its missions in international waters near Australia, Davis and Roggenveen said, so a reliable flow of information on China is crucial.

A Chinese research vessel making a loop around Australia is a case in point. The Tan Suo Yi Hao has been cruising international waters off Australia’s southern and western coasts for two weeks surveying subsea communication cables – critical infrastructure that allows Australians to send everything from emails to military secrets.

“I’d prefer it wasn’t there,” is about as much as Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese could say when asked by journalists for his thoughts.

UK could target parts of Chinese state under new foreign influence rules,"The government could target parts of China’s security apparatus under new foreign influence rules, the Guardian has learned.

Ministers are considering including parts of the Chinese state accused of interference activities on the enhanced tier of the foreign influence registration scheme (Firs).

China as a whole is not expected to be included on the enhanced tier, according to several people briefed on the discussions, but government sources stressed that no final decision about its status had been taken.

Firs, which will launch on 1 July, will require anyone in the UK acting for a foreign power or entity to declare their activities to the government.

The scheme will operate on two tiers. The enhanced tier will cover countries and entities deemed a particular risk, which will require extra disclosures.

Ministers have announced that Iran and Russia will be on the enhanced tier, meaning anyone directed by those two countries to carry out activities in the UK will have to declare it or face five years in prison.

The government has yet to say anything about China’s place in Firs, a matter which is subject to internal debate by ministers and officials weighing up security concerns against the economic benefits of closer ties with Beijing.

Financial services companies have privately argued against including China on the enhanced tier on the basis that they would have to fill out burdensome paperwork to justify business meetings.

In an effort to strengthen security without compromising economic ties, ministers are considering including specific parts of the Chinese political system that have been accused of interference in the west on the enhanced tier.

Entities under consideration include Beijing’s Ministry of State Security, which is its intelligence service, the United Front Work Department, often referred to as the international arm of the Chinese Communist party (CCP), and the People’s Liberation Army, China’s military. The government could also target the CCP as a whole.

A Home Office spokesperson said: “We do not comment on security matters.”

MI5’s director general, Ken McCallum, said in a 2022 speech that “the Chinese intelligence services, or bodies within the CCP itself – such as its United Front Work Department (UFWD) – are mounting patient, well-funded, deceptive campaigns to buy and exert influence” in the UK.

McCallum said the UFWD aimed “to amplify pro-CCP voices, and silence those that question the CCP’s legitimacy or authority”. He said its activities had “very real consequences in communities here in the UK” and that “it needs to be challenged”.

Conservative MPs have called for China to be included in the enhanced tier. The former security minister, Tom Tugendhat, told the Commons last year that “the advice from MI5 was very, very clear. If China isn’t in the enhanced tier, it’s not worth having.”

There are long-running tensions over the issue between the Home Office and the Treasury, which is relaying concerns about the potential burden on businesses.

Labour has pursued a rapprochement with Beijing since taking office. The foreign secretary, David Lammy, and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have made trips to China in an effort to maintain positive economic relations despite security concerns.

Douglas Alexander, a trade minister, became the latest government figure to visit China last week for talks amid the intensifying trade dispute between Beijing and Washington. China is the UK’s fifth-largest trading partner.

"Rohan Dennis shows ‘no remorse’ over death of Melissa Hoskins, says her family","Former world champion and Olympic cyclist, Rohan Dennis, has shown no remorse and “perceives himself as a victim” despite him accidentally killing his wife, her family has told a court in South Australia.

Melissa Hoskins, 32, also an acclaimed world and Olympic cyclist, died when she was struck by a car driven by her husband in December 2023.

Dennis, 34, has pleaded guilty to committing an aggravated act likely to cause harm but he has not been held criminally responsible for his wife’s death.

During sentencing submissions in the district court in Adelaide on Monday, Hoskins’ family delivered victim impact statements while Dennis sat in the dock.

Amanda Hoskins said her daughter had loved Dennis “and I know that you would never intentionally hurt her”.

“I believe this is a tragic accident. Your temper is your downfall and needs to be addressed,” she said.

Hoskins’ sister, Jessica Locke, said she still had nightmares about police coming to her home on 31 December 2023 to inform her of the tragedy.

“Neither myself, my family or friends have received any kind of apology from Rohan for his actions on that night,” Locke said.

“No remorse has been shown. If anything, Rohan’s actions since that night appear to suggest he perceives himself as a victim of the situation. Seeing him behave like this overwhelms me with sadness and anger.

“The lack of empathy and understanding for his actions … I’ve really struggled to process.”

She had been “cut off from my niece and nephew, and my kids from their cousins”.

Melissa Hoskins’s father, Peter Hoskins, said the family did not get to say goodbye to Melissa, who had just returned to Australia after living in Spain.

In a video call on 30 December, “she could hardly contain her joy at the prospect of hosting her first new year’s eve party”, he said.

“The next time I saw Melissa was in the mortuary viewing room at the Royal Adelaide Hospital … that, I will never forget. It will haunt me forever,” he said.

“Our greatest fear is losing access to [our grandchildren, now aged six and four].”

They were “silent grievers” who were too young to realise the present and future impact of their mother’s loss on their lives.

Addressing Dennis, he said: “Can I forgive you for the abandonment of your responsibilities as a husband and father? I doubt I can do that just yet given what you have taken from me and my family.”

Prosecutor, Tali Costi. told the court that while Dennis was not criminally responsible for Melissa’s death, he was “reckless to the fact she was holding onto the vehicle”.

Dennis’s barrister, Jane Abbey KC, said her client presented as a “very stoic man”.

“He says that’s important for his children,” she said. “When the public is not watching … he is not at all stoic. He is experiencing deep, deep grief.”

Before the incident, the couple had been involved in a dispute over kitchen cupboards, “the sort of thing that husbands and wives disagree about all the time”.

“Your honour, from looking at the CCTV, might see that there’s a period of less than three seconds in which a lot is happening,” Abbey said.

“[Dennis] describes to police hearing a noise, that noise it would seem was her jumping onto the car ... and one can see that shortly after that noise, and allowing for some response time, the brake lights show.”

She asked that her client receive a suspended sentence, which was not opposed by the prosecution.

Hoskins competed at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics in the cycling team pursuit, and was in the squad that won the 2015 world title in the event.

During his competitive career, Dennis won two world titles in the road time trial, as well as silver in the team pursuit at the 2012 Olympics and bronze in the road time trial at the Tokyo Olympics.

Albanese says Coalition tactics ‘beyond my comprehension’ after diss track release,"Anthony Albanese says Liberal campaign tactics such as releasing a hip-hop diss track against Labor are “beyond my comprehension”, accusing his opponents of “borrowing ideas” in their election pitch.

The Liberal campaign released a rap song with lyrics critical of Labor’s record on the cost of living, claiming the economy was “looking a mess” and that “eggs and cheese” cost $100. The song, titled Leaving Labor, was shared on the opposition’s SoundCloud account on Monday. While Coalition sources maintained the song was not generated by artificial intelligence, the campaign did not reveal the artist behind it, only saying it was a “commercial artist”.

Hours after the Liberal campaign had shared the song with journalists, the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, was asked about it at a press conference, and said he had not heard it. “I’m sure the gurus have put together a cracking ad,” he said.

At his own press conference in Tasmania, the prime minister said jokingly that the song had been “drawn to my attention”.

“The Liberal party can explain their own campaign,” he said at a paper mill in Boyer, north of Hobart. “Some of it is way beyond my comprehension, some of the things they’re doing in this campaign.”The noted rock’n’roll fan continued: “You know, there’s lots of really good Australian music around.”

“We heard one of those at my campaign launch yesterday: Sounds of Then by the great Ganggajang. We can all sing ‘This is Australia’,” he said.

“We are a different country. I’m running as an Australian prime minister on Australian values. I’ll leave it to others to see why they consistently just borrow cultures and ideas and policies from other places as well.”

Albanese and Labor have regularly used American music in campaign videos online. One recent video of Albanese was soundtracked by a Kendrick Lamar song; Labor has also referenced Sabrina Carpenter or her music in several posts.

When sharing the song, Coalition sources referenced famous American rap feuds including Drake and Lamar, and Nas and Jay-Z. The cover art for the song, with Albanese’s face superimposed on shrugging emojis, appeared to be a nod to Drake’s 2021 album Certified Lover Boy, which was referenced several times in diss tracks from Lamar during their 2024 feud.

Critics and music fans reached broad consensus Drake lost the feud after a weeks-long public battle with Lamar, who later performed several songs criticising him at the February 2025 NFL Super Bowl.

Leaving Labor includes lyrics such as: “We living cheque to cheque / Labor’s got us feeling so stressed”; “We need to find a solution / we need to switch up the people in power”; and “Albo’s got to leave”.

The song carries an authorisation message at the end for the Liberal party.

Comments about the song on SoundCloudwere mostly negative.

The track recalled a similar stunt from the Liberals in the 2022 election, an ad jingle titled There’s a hole in your budget, later released with a “club remix”.

The Coalition senator Matt Canavan backed the new song on Monday as a “catchy tune”, but when asked if he’d put it on his own playlist, admitted “probably not”.

“If it gets the message out … If it makes people to understand those real issues which are causing pain for everyday Australians, I’m all for it,” he told ABC’s Afternoon Briefing.

The Greens senator Barbara Pocock, on the same panel, suggested it was “not going to be a memorable hit for the 2025 election”.

“If you want to connect with young people, have some policies that actually matter to them: deal with student debt, talk about housing and make real changes that make a difference,” she said.

Sony hikes PlayStation 5 price by 25% as Trump tariffs bite,"Sony has increased the price of its PlayStation 5 by 25% as the video game industry reels from the impact of Donald Trump’s tariffs.

The Japanese game developer said it had made the “tough decision” to raise the price of the console’s digital edition to £429.99 in the UK and €499.99 in Europe, starting from Monday. There will be no price change for the standard PS5, which comes with a disk drive.

The company cited “a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates” behind its decision to increase the retail price of the PS5 in some markets in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Oceania.

In Australia, the standard PS5 will rise to A$829.95, while the digital edition will increase to A$749.95. In New Zealand, the standard console will increase to NZ$949.95, and the digital to NZ$859.95.

The technology industry has been grappling with the possible impact of President Trump’s tariffs on its supply chains. Rival Japanese game developer Nintendo unveiled its new handheld console, the Switch 2, the day before Trump launched his barrage of “reciprocal” tariffs on foreign goods on 2 April. A few days later, the company postponed preorders of the device in the US, as it said it would need to assess the potential effect of tariffs.

Japan was hit with a 24% tariff on its exports to the US on Trump’s “liberation day” on 2 April. Like most of Trump’s new tariffs, they have been paused for 90 days. However, the Japanese prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, said on Monday that his country did not plan to make big concessions in negotiations with the US and that it would not rush to reach a deal. Talks between the two governments are due this week.

Companies such as Apple, whose products are largely assembled in China, are also bracing for higher costs. Analysts at the investment bank UBS have warned that the price of an iPhone 16 Max, with 256GB of storage, could rise 79% from $1,199 (£915) to about $2,150 (£1,600), based on a total tariff of 145%.

While there is still a great deal of uncertainty around Trump’s trade policy, Japanese shares rose on Monday after the US said it would pause levies on some electronics, including smartphones. Tokyo’s index of blue chip stocks, the Nikkei 225, closed up 1%.

However, US officials said on Sunday that the pause on smartphones, laptops and other electronic products from import tariffs on China will be short-lived, with Trump warning on Sunday that no one was “getting off the hook”.

A ‘diss track’ and Harry Dutton’s campaign cameo: the Coalition wants to show it ‘gets it’,"Harry Dutton – the 20-year-old apprentice carpenter and son of the opposition leader, Peter Dutton – is struggling to afford his first home.

We didn’t learn this from a journalist or member of the public trawling through his personal affairs, offending the unwritten rule that a politician’s family should be spared the scrutiny necessarily applied to their father, mother or partner.

No, we know this because Harry told us.

A day after he and siblings Bec and Tom featured prominently in the Coalition’s official campaign launch, Harry was in tow as his father started the big sell of a policy designed to make it easier for young people to break into a broken housing market.

The Liberal leader wants to allow first home buyers to deduct mortgage repayments from their income tax because, as he told reporters at a housing construction site on Monday, it “kills him” to hear stories of young, hard-working Australians who save and save and yet can’t afford a home.

That cohort – as we now know – includes Harry, and Bec, a childcare worker.

“I am saving up for a house and so is my sister, Bec, and a lot of my mates, but as you probably heard, it’s almost impossible to get in, in the current state,” Harry said.

“So I mean we’re saving like mad but it doesn’t look like we’ll get there in the near future.”

Dutton was quickly and predictably confronted with the obvious question: would a father who has reportedly made $30m in property transactions over 35 years give his son a hand?

3:18 Albanese v Dutton, Chalmers v Taylor. The week of debates - TLDR: Election 2025 – video

Dutton ignored the question, perhaps concluding there was little more to gain from Harry’s campaign cameo.

There is also the somewhat awkward possibility that Harry’s aspiration might be bettered achieved under Labor’s election offering, which would allow all first home buyers to buy a home with a 5% deposit without paying mortgage insurance.

So what was the benefit of him showing up?

Whatever the Dutton family’s financial circumstances might be, Harry’s apparent struggle to afford a first home is one many young Australians can empathise with.

Dutton appears to have made a calculated judgment that the risk of exposing his son to the national media was outweighed by the opportunity to show millennials and gen Z – and their worried parents – that he “gets it” and “gets them”.

Separately on Monday, the Liberals released a “diss track” titled Leaving Labor – a homage to the viral feud between rap rivals between Kendrick Lamar and Drake.

The tune and Harry’s guest appearance were unrelated, for all we can tell.

But the two deliberate campaign events speak to the Coalition’s attempt to engage younger voters, a powerful, growing (and largely disengaged) cohort that both major parties believe are up for grabs on 3 May.

Asked about the “diss track” on Monday, Dutton said he hadn’t heard it.

“Harry may have,” he said.

Harry’s cameo served another purpose.

As part of a months-long process to refine Dutton’s image, the very public father-son interaction could help – if only momentarily and only for some – to humanise a man widely viewed as the hard-nosed ex-Queensland cop.

Dutton’s critics will view it as the desperate act of a desperate politician tanking in the polls.

Others aren’t so cynical.

“This is who he [Dutton] is: an intensely focused family man,” says Andrew Carswell, a former senior adviser to former prime minister Scott Morrison, whose wife, Jenny, and children Abbey and Lily featured at times during his election campaigns.

“This is not a leader trying to save his political skin.”

Albanese’s son, Nathan, joined his father and the prime minister’s partner, Jodie Haydon, on stage at Labor’s campaign launch in Perth.

But he has otherwise remained outside public spotlight, where the families of politicians typically are.

David Pocock says major parties lack the ‘courage’ to tackle housing crisis – as it happened,"7h ago 08.49 CEST David Pocock says major parties missing the ‘long-term thinking and courage’ to tackle housing crisis The independent senator David Pocock says both Labor and the Coalition are missing “long-term thinking and courage” on housing. He told ABC’s Afternoon Briefing that while the Labor policy will add to supply, neither party wants to tackle one of the root causes which is the tax system treating housing as an investment vehicle, “not a human right or something you actually need to be able to flourish in your community in society”. This is what the major parties on missing is long-term thinking and courage to take on these challenges. It seems like the whole election strategy is to basically say “we are slightly better than the other bunch”. How have we got to this point in Australia? I think you are seeing independents across the country listening to their community, saying we want a long-term vision and a plan for this, and we want to tackle the things that have been in the too-hard basket for too long. When it comes to our tax system, capital gains tax, discounts, negative gearing, stamp duty are all things we should be dealing with. When it was pointed out Labor went to the 2019 election with a policy on this and lost, Pocock says he is hearing the housing situation is desperate, and very different from the situation in 2019.

7h ago 08.42 CEST Katy Gallagher backs ‘tried and tested’ deposit guarantee The finance minister and Labor campaign spokesperson, Katy Gallagher, is on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing and was asked to respond to criticism that both Labor and the Coalition’s housing policies announced yesterday will lead to increased prices. Gallagher said the 5% deposit guarantee is one of a number of programs aimed at getting more homes, and people into homes. She said the Coalition’s policy is “fewer homes and higher prices” forcing young people to “ransack their savings”. Asked whether she would like to see house prices rise in Australia, Gallagher says the government is focused on making sure there is enough supply. On whether this transfers the risk to taxpayers, Gallagher said the program already exists, and it’s a “tried and tested” system with only three defaults out of 150,000 in the program already. Share Updated at 08.57 CEST

8h ago 08.26 CEST Canavan says migration cuts will prevent house price rises On whether the Coalition’s housing policies will push up prices, Canavan says that is not the case due to the Coalition’s promised cuts to migration. I don’t necessarily think that is true in the overall context of cutting migration as well. The other thing we will do is lots of different things going on with policies and the other aspect we will do, which the government has failed to do, and not promising to do anything believable, is we will have 100,000 homes opened up over the next five years by bringing in fewer migrants. We can’t bring in the number of people we are right now, and that’s a big reason for the housing crisis we have right now. Barbara Pocock says the Coalition’s policy will cause prices to rise, while adding Labor’s policies are just “tinkering at the edges”, and there should be tax reform, including taking away tax benefits for the second or more investment properties. Pocock says rent increases should also be capped, and there should be affordable social housing. Share Updated at 08.40 CEST

8h ago 08.21 CEST Canavan ‘all for’ anti-Albanese diss track … but won’t be putting it on his playlist Asked on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing whether he will put the Liberal’s diss track on his campaign playlist, Nationals senator Matt Canavan says “probably not” – but said it is helping get the message out. It gets the message out, you are pushing the message that the average Australian is paying $3,000 a year [more] for groceries and the loss of control in energy policy at some of the highest prices in the world is to blame for that. It gets people to understand those issues causing pain for everyday Australians, I’m all for it. The Greens senator Barbara Pocock says it is “not a memorable hit for the 2025 election” and to connect with young people they need to talk about policies young people care about like student debt, and housing affordability. She said Dutton’s theme song should involve “backflips”. View image in fullscreen Matt Canavan. Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian Share Updated at 08.59 CEST

8h ago 08.08 CEST ‘No way’ Liberal candidate endorses views expressed in paper he co-authored, shadow multicultural affairs spokesperson says The shadow minister for multicultural affairs, Jason Wood, has told local media there is no way the Liberal candidate for Bruce holds the views expressed in a parliamentary submission he co-authored. On Saturday, Guardian Australia revealed Zahid Safi co-authored a 2021 parliamentary submission suggesting the Hazara community in Afghanistan was not persecuted on the basis of its ethnicity, contradicting the Australian government and drawing rebuke from international human rights groups. The comments led members of the Hazara community, which has a significant presence in the electorate of Bruce, to lodge their own dissenting submissions to the inquiry, alleging the co-authors including Safi sought to erase the “well-documented persecution of an entire ethnic group”. View image in fullscreen Jason Wood (right) has defended the Liberal candidate for Bruce, Zahid Safi (left). Photograph: Mick Tsikas/EPA Wood has told the Berwick Star that he spoke to Safi in recent days and said “his input into the report was on the health aspect”: There’s no way that he or anyone at the Liberal party has the same view [as the report on downplaying Hazara genocide]. Guardian Australia asked the Coalition whether the co-authored report reflected its policy position but did not receive a response. Safi said he was “a staunch advocate for freedom of religion or belief for all individuals worldwide” and that “a full and fair reading of my submission makes clear that I advocated for every single living individual at risk from the national atrocity and humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan under the Taliban.” Liberal candidate co-authored inquiry submission suggesting Hazaras not persecuted for ethnicity in Afghanistan Read more Share Updated at 08.18 CEST

8h ago 07.54 CEST A quick roundup of the last three questions: Albanese was again asked about the Liberals’ diss track – he said people can look up his DJ sets on Spotify, and he offered to play his music to the travelling press pool. On why the work deductions (where you can just claim $1,000 in deductions without needing receipts) won’t come in for 27 months, Albanese said that came off the back of advice from the ATO on when it could be ready for such an initiative.



And finally, he was asked, given Labor is trying to closely tie Peter Dutton and the Coalition to the Trump administration, and Albanese pointed out the Trump administration didn’t do the mortgage tax deduction policy, doesn’t it prove Dutton isn’t like Trump? Albanese alludes to this story: Oh, people will make their own conclusion – but people can have a look at the caps that my team wear, and the caps that the other team wear and draw their own conclusions.

8h ago 07.50 CEST Manufacturing ‘just leaves’ without investment, Albanese says On whether the investment funding announcement today can keep the industry alive, Albanese says it is a “very specific investment”. There was a previous investment by the former Labor government many years ago that allowed an upgrade of this facility. And you know what? Those 310 people who work here, and the more than 1,000 people whose jobs depend upon this – they pay taxes, they contribute to the economy, they create jobs in this local economy as well. This is about supporting our manufacturing. He said without supporting manufacturing it “just leaves”, and said the former Coalition government “told the car industry to bugger off”. And as a direct result, that had a multiplier effect as well, because when you have manufacturing, skills are learned off each other, there’s a flow-on effect both for the technology and also the skills.

8h ago 07.47 CEST Help-to-buy scheme ‘won’t be competing with investors’, PM says Asked about whether the government’s help-to-buy scheme for first home buyers is “dangerous” or a risk when we could be headed into a global recession, Albanese says of the 150,000 people who have been through the system so far, there have been just three defaults. So all of the same conditions, right, to get your borrowing still apply. The only difference is that the government effectively is guarantor for 15% of the loan. So we’re very confident. When asked whether the houses being built will be offered at a lower market rate, especially for expensive cities like Sydney, the prime minister said: They won’t be competing with investors. I can’t explain it more simply than that. If you speak to young people about what is happening in auctions right around, if you exclude investors and keep things just for people who are first home buyers, it’s a gamechanger.

8h ago 07.41 CEST Albanese says Coalition diss track tactics ‘beyond my comprehension’ Josh Butler asks the PM about that diss track by the Liberal party, and Albanese says it was “drawn to my attention”. Albanese says he’ll leave the party to explain their own campaign tactics but adds: It’s beyond my comprehension, some of the things they’re doing in this campaign. I gotta say, there’s lots of really good Australian music around … I’ll leave it to others to say why they [Liberals] consistently just borrow cultures and ideas and policies from other places. Butler also asks, more seriously, about whether Labor supports the Liberal’s policy for tax deductible mortgages for first home buyers. Albanese says the policy (which he says he read in the AFR) was tried and abandoned by the Trump administration in the first term. This is a policy that has never been supported, wasn’t supported by them the entire time that they were in government. They did nothing about housing. They helped create the problem for a decade.

8h ago 07.37 CEST PM rules out changes to native forest logging On to questions, Albanese is asked about native forest logging, which he says there will be “no changes to” despite many Labor voters wanting to see an end to it. We have no change to our native forestry policy because we don’t. Then asked (by a newspaper journalist) whether its a risky idea to put this money into a business so closely tied to a “sunset industry like newspaper distribution”. Albanese seems a little taken aback and says “good luck” explaining that to his team on Monday. Good luck, on Monday, explaining that. I love picking up a paper. I love holding it. I love reading it. So do many Australians. And you know what? I think it’s important that it continue to exist.

Albanese calls Collins a “fantastic cabinet minister” but again won’t confirm the portfolio. Julie Collins is a fantastic cabinet minister, but we’re not getting ahead of ourselves. We’re not getting ahead of ourselves. We’re focused on 3 May. Julie Collins will always have my support because she’s a fantastic minister and she’s a great representative for Tasmania.

Albanese says: $9m of that over the next two years will be to ensure its financial viability, as this transition occurs upfront, so that they can decarbonise and to diversify its production. We’ll also provide up to $15m to match the company’s own investments in electrification that are occurring.

‘I should’ve done the elbow bump’: Plibersek and Albanese brush off awkward greeting at Labor election campaign launch,"Tanya Plibersek and Anthony Albanese have brushed off an awkward moment at Sunday’s Labor federal election campaign launch when the prime minister appeared to block a hug from the environment minister, insisting that the pair are good friends.

The interaction took place as Albanese greeted members of his frontbench in the audience, with Jim Chalmers giving him a backslap and the former PM Julia Gillard shaking his hand, before Albanese held her arm up in the air.

But Plibersek went in for a hug and a kiss, at which point Albanese grabbed both her hands and blocked her from getting any closer.

Plibersek was asked about the moment on breakfast television on Monday morning and suggested that Albanese may have avoided the hug to protect himself from infection.

“I reckon we should still all be elbow bumping,” she told Sunrise. “During an election campaign, the last thing you want is to catch a cold from someone – so that’s on me. I should’ve done the elbow bump, I reckon.”

Asked if she and prime minister still got on, she responded: “Yeah, of course!” Asked if they were “buddies” she replied: “Yep … yeah, I said of course,” after a pause and some ribbing.

Later on Monday Albanese was asked about the same moment and whether he would keep Plibersek in the environment portfolio for three more years.

“You know what … Tanya Plibersek has been a friend of mine for a long period of time,” he said. “We live in neighbouring seats. We’re good mates, and she’s doing a fantastic job.”

The pair have had more than one awkward moment of late, most notably when Albanese helped to tank a deal Plibersek had struck with the Greens and the independent senator David Pocock to pass Labor’s legislation for a new environmental protection agency. The prime minister has since promised that, if Labor gets in again, he’ll put a new EPA on the table.

He also sidestepped his environment minister when he introduced legislation to protect Tasmania’s salmon farming industry in Macquarie Harbour.

Sir Thomas Drew will take over as ambassador in Paris starting in August 2025. He has spent the last four years as the FCDO’s most senior official responsible for Defence and Intelligence where he led on issues ranging from Covid-19 to threats from hostile states. He will take over from Dame Menna Rawlings in the summer. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the British prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, have grown into close political allies in the last few months as they have tried to build support for some kind of European led protection force in Ukraine.

Zelenskyy urges Trump to view devastation in Ukraine caused by Russia’s invasion,"Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged Donald Trump to visit Ukraine to see the devastation caused by Russia’s invasion, while the US president appeared to play down Moscow’s latest deadly attack, the worst on civilians this year, calling it “a mistake”.

International leaders condemned Russia’s strike on the centre of the Ukrainian city of Sumy on Sunday, which killed 34 people, including two children. Two ballistic missiles hit as people made their way to church for Palm Sunday.

One of the missiles exploded next to a crowded trolleybus, killing many of the passengers onboard. Bodies lay on the ground and cars burned as rescuers carried away bloodied survivors. More than 100 were injured.

Asked about Russia’s attack on civilians, Trump said he was trying to get the war stopped. “I think it was terrible and I was told they made a mistake, but I think it’s a horrible thing. I think the whole war is a horrible thing,” he said.

On Monday, the Kremlin denied its army had targeted civilians or that there had been any kind of “mistake”.

“Our army hits only military and military-related targets,” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said when asked about the strike and Trump’s comments.

Russia’s defence ministry appeared to concede there had been civilian casualties, but placed the blame on Ukraine. “The Kyiv regime continues to use the Ukrainian population as a human shield, placing military facilities and holding events with the participation of soldiers in the centre of a densely populated city,” the ministry said. Russia has made similar accusations since it invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

Trump also implied his predecessor, Joe Biden, was at fault for the war that began with Vladimir Putin’s invasion. “This war would never have started if I were president. That war is a shame,” he said.

His latest comments prompted an angry response from Ukrainians who are frustrated at Trump’s failure to confront or condemn Putin.

Olena Halushka, of the Anti-Corruption Action Centre in Kyiv, said: “No one accidentally uses a cluster munition warhead against a crowded city centre on a major holiday.” She also noted that Russia had killed nine children in a similar strike last week on the city of Kryvyi Rih.

Gabrielius Landsbergis, a former Lithuanian foreign minister, said: “This was not a mistake. A mistake is something like imposing tariffs on penguins. What we saw in Sumy is a deliberate continuation of a genocidal invasion. Our real mistake is not helping Ukraine enough.”

In an interview with the CBS show 60 Minutes, recorded before the attack on Sumy, Zelenskyy urged Trump to see the damage from Russia’s invasion for himself. “Please, before any kind of decisions, any kind of forms of negotiations, come to see people, civilians, warriors, hospitals, churches, children destroyed or dead,” he said.

The Ukrainian president pushed back on a suggestion made by the US vice-president, JD Vance, that Ukraine laid on “propaganda tours” for foreign leaders. “We will not prepare anything. It will not be theatre. You can go exactly where you want, in any city which [has] been under attacks,” Zelenskyy said.

He expressed frustration that senior White House figures continued to repeat Kremlin talking points. Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff – who met Putin on Friday in St Petersburg – recently said four Ukrainian regions had “voted” to join Russia, a reference to fake referendums in occupied territory.

“I believe that Russian narratives prevail in the United States. It seems to me that the vice-president is justifying Putin’s actions. This is a change in reality. The Russians are the aggressors, and we are the victims,” Zelenskyy said.

Kyiv has accepted a US proposal made a month ago for a 30-day ceasefire. During this period Russia has escalated its bombardment of Ukrainian cities. Zelenskyy said: “Putin can’t be trusted. I told that to President Trump many times. So when you ask why the ceasefire isn’t working – this is why.”

He added: “Putin never wanted an end to the war. Putin never wanted us to be independent. Putin wants to destroy us completely – our sovereignty and our people.”

Zelenskyy said the conflict could “escalate into world war three if Putin is not stopped”. He said the “dictator’s ultimate goal was to revive the Russian empire” and to “return territories under Nato protection” – meaning the Baltic states and eastern Europe.

Ukrainian officials said Zelenskyy had been trying to fix his relationship with Trump after their disastrous February meeting in the White House. The Trump administration has indicated that Ukraine’s future security needs are now Europe’s problem.

Speaking to CBS, Zelenskyy said US military aid to Ukraine had “practically stopped”, adding that Kyiv was willing to buy US-made Patriot air defence systems.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/14/zelenskyy-invites-trump-to-ukraine-to-see-damage-from-russia-invasion-first-hand,1
Weather tracker: north-west Italy braces for thunderstorms and snow,"North-west Italy is braced for heavy rainfall and thunderstorms across the southern side of the Alps, particularly in Piedmont and Liguria.

Turin and Genoa are expected to be among the worst affected, with snowfall also likely on higher ground. The region has been forecast to receive 140-160mm of rainfall between Sunday and Friday this week.

Turin could face 50-60mm of rain on Wednesday alone – equivalent to north-west Italy’s average rainfall for the entire month of April – with a chance of flooding and landslides.

Corsica is expected to be hit by significant rainfall totals of more than 120mm in places. Tuscany is under alert for rainfall totals exceeding 55mm from Monday.

The stormy weather is driven by a developing low-pressure system over the region, which is drawing in warm, moist air from the Tyrrhenian Sea. As this air mass meets the Alps, it is being forced upwards, triggering rapid condensation and heavy precipitation as a result of orographic lift.

Meanwhile, central and eastern Europe could get an early taste of summer this week, with unusually high temperatures forecast across several countries.

Daytime highs of up to 24C (75F) are likely in Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia – more than 10C above the seasonal average.

Berlin could top 26C on Wednesday and Thursday, while temperatures in the Polish city of Łódź and Albania’s capital, Tirana, could climb past 28C, a sharp departure from typical mid-April conditions.

The warm spell follows Europe’s hottest March on record, according to the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. Experts say this may signal a challenging summer, with an increased risk of severe heatwaves and wildfires across the continent.

Over the weekend, Storm Olivier swept across the Canary Islands, lashing tourist hotspots such as Tenerife, Gran Canaria and Fuerteventura. Lanzarote was hit particularly hard and received 60mm of rainfall on Saturday. Homes and streets were flooded with muddy water that triggered widespread power outages and flight cancellations.

Spanish authorities declared a state of emergency after more than 300 weather-related incidents.

Recovery efforts are under way, with emergency crews using pumps to drain flood waters and begin repairs.

With the Easter holidays in full swing for many travellers, Storm Olivier has caused significant disruption across the region.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/14/weather-tracker-north-west-italy-braces-for-thunderstorms-and-snow,1
Hungary poised to adopt constitutional amendment to ban LGBTQ+ gatherings,"Hungarian lawmakers are expected to vote in a controversial constitutional amendment on Monday that rights campaigners have described as a “significant escalation” in the government’s efforts to crack down on dissent and chip away at human rights.

Backed by the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, and his rightwing populist party, Fidesz, the amendment seeks to codify the government’s recent ban on Pride events, paving the way for authorities to use facial recognition software to identify attenders and potentially fine them.

The amendment, which the government says prioritises the protection of children’s physical, mental and moral development, also enshrines the recognition of only two sexes, providing a constitutional basis for denying the gender identities of some in Hungary.

After Orbán’s repeated claims of foreign interference in the country’s politics, the amendment will also allow the government to temporarily suspend Hungarian citizenship in the case of dual nationals deemed to pose a threat to the country’s security or sovereignty.

The Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a rights group, described the amendment as a means of “legislating fear” in the EU country. “These laws represent a significant escalation in the government’s efforts to suppress dissent, weaken human rights protection and consolidate its grip on power,” it said in a statement.

The opposition Momentum party highlighted similarities with restrictions in Russia. Much like Vladimir Putin, Orbán has sought to portray himself as a champion of traditional family values, ushering in policies that include blocking same-sex couples from adopting children and barring any mention of LGBTQ+ issues in school education programmes.

Momentum has issued a call on social media for Hungarians to join it in a blockade of the country’s parliament on Monday, in the hope of keeping lawmakers from voting in the legislation. “Let’s collectively prevent them from leading us down the Putin road and depriving us of our freedom,” it said.

The constitutional amendment is expected to be approved almost a month after lawmakers fast-tracked a law that banned public events held by LGBTQ+ communities. Thousands of people have since taken to the streets, blocking bridges and major thoroughfares with chants of “democracy” and “assembly is a fundamental right” in weekly protests.

“This government isn’t just dismantling democracy brick by brick, it’s now going at it with a bulldozer,” Ákos Hadházy, an independent lawmaker who campaigns alongside Momentum, said at a recent rally, according to Bloomberg. “We are here because we need to act fast to get ahead and stop it.”

Orbán and his government have said their aim is to protect children from what they describe as “sexual propaganda”, but analysts have pointed to forthcoming elections to argue that the country’s LGBTQ+ minority is being scapegoated by a government intent on mobilising its conservative base.

Orbán, who has long faced criticism for weakening democratic institutions and gradually undermining the rule of law, is facing an unprecedented challenge from a former member of the Fidesz party’s elite, Péter Magyar, before next year’s elections.

As news of the Pride ban broke last month, 22 European embassies in Hungary, including those of the UK, France and Germany, issued a joint statement saying they were deeply concerned that the legislation would result in “restrictions on the right of peaceful assembly and the freedom of expression”.

The EU’s equality commissioner, Hadja Lahbib, also weighed in, writing on social media: “Everyone should be able to be who they are, live & love freely. The right to gather peacefully is a fundamental right to be championed across the European Union. We stand with the LGBTQI community – in Hungary & in all member states.”

The organisers of Budapest Pride, which regularly attracts tens of thousands of people, said they were determined to go ahead with this year’s march on 28 June. “This is not child protection, this is fascism,” they said last month.

The amendment, the 15th to Hungary’s constitution since it was unilaterally authored and approved by the ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition in 2011, also seeks to reinforce Orbán over what he claims are foreign efforts to influence Hungary’s politics.

In a recent speech laced with conspiracy theories, Orbán pledged to “eliminate the entire shadow army” of foreign-funded “politicians, judges, journalists, pseudo-NGOs and political activists”.

Rights groups described the amendment as a step in this direction for Orbán, a self-described “illiberal” leader, because it allows for the suspension of Hungarian citizenship for up to 10 years for dual nationals deemed to pose a threat to public order or security. The suspensions would only apply to Hungarians who hold citizenship of another country that is not a member of the EU or European Economic Area.

The Hungarian Helsinki Committee, the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International and the Háttér Society have urged the European Commission to launch a procedure against Hungary’s government, arguing that the recent changes breach EU law.

The groups highlighted the “gravity and urgency of the consequences of the adopted changes” in a recent statement, noting that they would “force LGBTQ+ people complete out of the public eye”. The nationwide ban is believed to be the first of its kind in the EU’s recent history.

The groups also said the amendment went further than violating the rights of LGBTQ+ people and those who support them, describing it as a tool to further instil fear among those who voice dissent in the country. “The changes have overarching consequences that affect fundamental rights well beyond the issue of Pride,” they said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/14/hungary-poised-to-adopt-constitutional-amendment-to-ban-lgbtq-gatherings,1
Civilian deaths in Sumy attack may force Washington to get tough with Putin,"Even by the warped standards of wartime, Russia’s Sunday morning attack on Sumy was astonishingly brazen. Two high-speed ballistic missiles, armed, Ukraine says, with cluster munitions, slammed into the heart of the border city in mid-morning as families went to church, waited for a theatre performance or were simply strolling about on a mild spring day.

The death toll currently stands at 34, including two children. Images from the scene show bodies or body bags on the ground, a trolley bus and cars burnt out, rubble and glass scattered around. It was reckless, cruel and vicious and its consequences entirely predictable to those who gave the order and pressed “launch”.

To contemplate a daytime city-centre attack, in the full knowledge that civilians will be present, reflects a Russian culture of impunity that has been allowed to endure without effective challenge. Nevertheless, Washington’s approach, under Donald Trump, has been to try to negotiate an end to the war by talking directly with Moscow, while remaining mostly silent on Russian attacks on civilians.

Talks between the US and Russia have continued unabated over the past two months at a time when Russian attacks on Ukraine’s cities appear to have stepped up. Nine adults and nine children were killed when a Russian ballistic missile using cluster bombs struck a children’s playground in Kryvyi Rih at the end of last week.

People were burned alive in their cars and the bodies of children were found dead in the playground, yet the attack was weakly condemned by the US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, who, toeing the White House line, would not say the deadly missile was from Russia as she tweeted: “This is why the war must end.”

Brink has since announced she will step down and been more forthright. On Sunday, the ambassador attributed the Sumy attack to Russia and repeated that it appeared cluster bombs had been used. But now that she is on her way out, it is easier for her to speak her mind while Russia’s Vladimir Putin toys with Trump and the rest of the US administration in peace talks that have hardly developed in two months.

On Friday, the Russian leader spent four hours in talks with Steve Witkoff, a donor real estate developer who has become a key Trump adviser on Ukraine as well as the Middle East. What they talked about is unclear, but reports suggest Witkoff has been pushing the idea that the quickest way to get Russia to agree a ceasefire in Ukraine is to force Kyiv to hand over the entirety of four provinces that are only partly occupied by Russia’s military, including the cities of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.

The dissonance between the killing and destruction in Sumy on Sunday and the photographed handshake between Witkoff and Putin is all too evident to most observers. It is not clear why it should even be contemplated that Ukraine hand over territory (something that even the US cannot easily force on Kyiv) when Russia is willing to countenance daytime attacks on civilians.

But Moscow believes, and acts like it believes, it can get away with it. The Kremlin will ignore condemnation from European leaders and wait for the news cycle to move on – and will almost certainly continue to attack Ukrainian cities to little military purpose. Not only are drone attacks commonplace, but there are now concerns they are routinely being armed with cluster munitions, while almost every day one or two hard-to-intercept ballistic missiles are thrown into the deadly mix.

In Kyiv, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hopes that gradually Trump will realise Putin is not negotiating in good faith. Certainly, the attack on the centre of Sumy hardly suggests a strong appetite for peace. But it is unclear at what point, if any, the White House is prepared to conclude that killing of civilians means that it needs to put genuine pressure on Russia to negotiate rather than indulge the Kremlin.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/13/ukraine-civilian-deaths-sumy-attack-russia-us-talks-trump-putin-analysis,1
Russian missile strike kills dozens in Ukrainian city of Sumy,"At least 34 people have been killed and more than 100 injured in a Russian ballistic missile strike in the Ukrainian city of Sumy as people were going to church for Palm Sunday, in the worst attack on civilians this year.

Two missiles landed in the crowded city centre on Sunday morning. One hit a trolley bus full of passengers. Footage from the scene showed bodies lying in the street, burning cars, and rescuers carrying bloodied survivors. Two of the dead were children.

“My seven-year-old son was running for shelter when the second missile struck. The blast ripped off a door which hit him in the leg. He has a bruise but is OK,” said Volodymyr Niankin, a film director. “My son said this is the most terrible day of his life.”

Niankin said he saw bodies on the ground. “Many of the people who died were sitting on the bus or walking in the road. A lot of people were out and about because it was a religious festival. I think this is genocide.”

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said there were “dozens of dead and wounded civilians”. He accused Russia of carrying out an act of deliberate terror and said tough reaction was needed from the US, Europe and the rest of the world.

“Enemy missiles hit an ordinary city street, ordinary life: houses, educational institutions, cars on the street … And this on a day when people go to church: Palm Sunday, the feast of the Lord’s entry into Jerusalem,” he posted on social media.

The attack caught the attention of Donald Trump, who described it as “horrible” and a “mistake”.

“I think it was terrible. And I was told they made a mistake,” he told journalists on Air Force One on Sunday. “But I think it’s a horrible thing. I think the whole war is a horrible thing.”

Earlier, Trump’s envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said the attack “crosses any line of decency”. “As a former military leader, I understand targeting and this is wrong. It is why President Trump is working hard to end this war,” he wrote on X.

Zelenskyy said the Kremlin was ignoring a US proposal for a full and unconditional ceasefire. “Unfortunately, there in Moscow they are convinced they can keep killing with impunity. Action is needed to change this situation,” he said.

Officials said 117 people had been injured, including 15 children.

European leaders also expressed their outrage.

UK prime minister Keir Starmer said he was “appalled at Russia’s horrific attacks on civilians”. Vladimir Putin “must now agree to a full and immediate ceasefire without conditions”, he said.

France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, agreed on the “urgent need to impose a ceasefire on Russia”. “Everyone knows it is Russia alone that wants this war,” he said. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, described the scenes from Sumy as heartbreaking and horrific.

The EU’s ambassador to Ukraine, Katarína Mathernová, called the strikes a war crime. “Nothing seems to be sacred to the Russians – neither churches, nor Ukrainian children,” she said.

Ukrainians contrasted the images of bodies in Sumy with photos of Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, warmly shaking hands with Putin on Friday. The two held four hours of talks in St Petersburg.

Putin’s press spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Sunday that the talks were going very well but that it was “impossible to expect any instant results”.

Trump has said he is “pissed off” at Russia’s failure to stop bombing, but has so far not taken any concrete measures against Moscow. Ukraine has signed up to a 30-day ceasefire that Washington proposed a month ago.

Since then, Russia has escalated its bombardment of Ukrainian cities, firing 70 missiles and 2,200 drones. Nine children and nine adults were killed earlier this month when a Russian missile hit a playground in the city of Kryvyi Rih.

Zelenskyy has been pressing allies to send another 10 Patriot air defence systems to protect Ukraine’s skies. “Talks have never stopped ballistic missiles and air bombs. We need the kind of attitude towards Russia that a terrorist deserves,” he said on Sunday.

Sumy is 15 miles (25km) from the border with Russia and is a major Ukrainian military hub. The missiles landed in a central civilian area where many people carrying willow branches for Palm Sunday were on their way to church.

Video from a car dashcam shows an orange flash as one of the missiles struck at 10.20am. Plumes of grey smoke can be seen as other vehicles reverse away from the danger and passersby run in panic.

The first missile hit a conference centre belonging to Sumy’s state university. Several children were waiting outside for an 11am theatre performance in a basement venue. The second landed 200 metres away, in Pokrovska Street, as the trolley bus rolled past.

Niankin said the centre was a unique arts hub and home to a theatre he ran. “I feel like half of my heart has been taken away. It was a place where we could play and create. Everything is destroyed: the stage, costumes, all our stuff. We have no chance to continue our work,” he said.

The director, who made a film about Sumy’s resistance to Russia’s 2022 invasion, said there were not a lot of people inside the building when it was flattened. “It happened half an hour before the show was due to start. My son was nearby attending a class in a studio.”

Ukraine’s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, said Russia had launched two Iskander-M missiles from its western territory in the Voronezh and Kursk regions. He identified the army forces responsible as the 112th and 448th missile brigades. “Another proof of the godlessness of the disgusting cursed Moscow,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/13/russian-missile-strike-kills-injured-ukraine-sumy,1
Hundreds of former Mossad operatives criticise Israel’s return to war in Gaza,"Hundreds of former operatives from Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency have criticised the return to war in Gaza amid growing frustration over the failure to bring home the remaining hostages held by Hamas.

A group of more than 250 former Mossad figures – including three ex-chiefs – gave their backing to a letter first signed by air force veterans and reservists that urged the Israeli government to prioritise bringing back the hostages over fighting Hamas in Gaza.

The Israeli government believes that 24 of the remaining 59 hostages, who were taken captive in Hamas’s attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, are still alive.

The letter decried the amping-up of Israeli strikes and ground operations in Gaza since the collapse of the ceasefire in March as driven by the personal interests of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. It accused his government of putting the lives of soldiers and the hostages at risk for his own political gain.

Critics have alleged that Netanyahu’s decision to return to war in Gaza was driven by a need to appease the far-right parties in his coalition, who have threatened to bring down his government if he does not completely crush Hamas.

“The war mainly serves political and personal interests and not security interests,” said the letter.

The letter was first published and publicly signed last week by almost 1,000 reservists and retired officers from Israel’s air force, which has been at the forefront of the continued assault on Gaza.

It prompted a vehement response from Netanyahu, who said it was written by “an extreme fringe group that is once again trying to break Israeli society from within” and ordered the dismissal of all the active-duty reservists who had signed it.

Several similar statements were successively made in support, including by reservists from Israel’s elite Unit 8200, the biggest military intelligence unit, and hundreds of reservist doctors.

Israel and Hamas have been engaged in negotiations in Cairo, with the involvement of Qatar, Egypt and the US, who have been attempting to broker another ceasefire after the last one collapsed in March and Israel launched a wave of strikes.

Reports emerged on Monday that Israel had proposed a deal to Hamas that would see 10 hostages released. According to Tikva Forum, a rightwing group advocating for the hostages, Netanyahu told the father of the hostage Eitan Mor on Sunday that the government was working on a deal that would bring home 10 captives, but gave no further details on the conditions Israel had put forward.

A Hamas official who spoke to the Lebanese newspaper Al Mayadeen said Israel had proposed the return of 10 hostages in return for an initial 45-day ceasefire, when the Israeli government’s blockade on aid going into Gaza would be lifted and the Israel Defense Forces would withdraw from Gaza territory they had seized since March.

According to the official, Israel and Hamas would also commit to negotiations for a second stage, which is where the previous ceasefire commitments had stalled and ultimately fallen apart. This would include discussions of a permanent ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, and the disarmament of Hamas.

Speaking to AFP on Monday, Taher al-Nunu, a senior Hamas official, accused Israel of obstructing progress towards a ceasefire. He said Hamas was willing “to release all Israeli captives in exchange for a serious prisoner swap deal, an end to the war, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and the entry of humanitarian aid”.

However, he made it clear that the disarmament of Hamas was not “up for negotiation”.

On Sunday night, hundreds of people, including dozens of family members of former and current hostages, staged a protest outside the home of Ron Dermer, the minister Netanyahu has put in charge of the hostage negotiations, leading to five arrests.

In recent days, hostage families have alleged that Dermer, who is one of Netanyahu’s closest advisers, has been delaying and obstructing negotiations in order to suit the government’s political agenda. The Netanyahu government has pushed back at the allegations, stating that it was doing everything to free the hostages.

Doron Zektser, the adoptive father of the hostage Edan Alexander, addressed Dermer in a statement: “Come out, update us on the situation. That’s your responsibility. If you can’t do the job, resign. He doesn’t speak with the families. They’re rushing to war when it’s clear that only a deal will bring the hostages back.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/14/israel-government-gaza-hostages-mossad-criticism,1
"Palestinian medic attacked in Gaza is being detained in Israel, says ICRC","A Palestinian paramedic who has been missing since a massacre of medics and rescue workers by Israeli troops in Gaza last month is being detained in Israel, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).

The whereabouts of Assad al-Nsasrah, a Palestinian paramedic, had been unknown for weeks since an incident on 23 March when workers from the Palestinian Red Crescent (PRCS) and Palestinian civil defence came under fire as they drove ambulances to rescue injured colleagues in the southern city of Rafah.

Fifteen Palestinian paramedics and rescue workers, including at least one United Nations employee, were killed in the attack by Israeli troops. The UN has said they were deliberately shot “one by one” and the bodies, along with the rescue vehicles, were then buried with a bulldozer in a sandy pit, in what appears to have been an attempt to cover up the killings. Witnesses who uncovered the bodies said the workers were found still in their uniforms and some had their hands tied.

The Red Crescent called the attack on its workers a “grave violation of international law” and has called for an international investigation.

Nsasrah, 47, from Gaza, who had been working for Red Crescent for 16 years, was among the medics in the ambulances caught up in the ambush, and he had not been seen since. In an interview with the Guardian, another survivor, the Red Crescent volunteer Munther Abed, 27, said he had seen Nsasrah being taken away alive and blindfolded by Israeli officers at the scene of the killings.

On Sunday, the ICRC said it had “received information that the PRCS medic Assad al-Nsasrah has been detained in an Israeli place of detention”. The ICRC spokesperson gave no further details on where Nsasrah was being held and confirmed that Israel had not granted access to visit him.

“The ICRC has not been able to visit any Palestinian detainees held in Israeli places of detention since 7 October 2023,” said the spokesperson. “The ICRC continues to call for access to all places of detention and reiterates publicly and privately that all detainees must always be treated humanely and with dignity.”

In a statement, PRCS called on the international community to demand the release of Nsasrah, a father of six, stating that he had been “forcibly abducted while carrying out his humanitarian duties”.

There was no immediate comment from the Israel military.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have faced mounting pressure over inconsistencies in their account of the attack. They had initially claimed troops opened fire on vehicles that were “advancing suspiciously” without headlights or emergency signals.

However, the IDF had to backtrack after mobile phone footage, from a medic who was among those killed at the scene, showed the ambulances – clearly marked with the Red Crescent logo – driving with flashing red emergency lights and headlights on their vehicles.

Abed, the medic who survived the attack, described how he was held for several hours by Israeli forces after the ambulances came under fire. He said he was fully stripped, beaten again and interrogated about his past before he was finally released.

The IDF said they were now re-examining “operational information” to understand why the initial account had been “mistaken”, and that an investigation was being carried out.

They added that a preliminary inquiry had indicated “troops opened fire due to a perceived threat after a previous encounter in the area, and that six of the individuals killed in the incident were identified as Hamas terrorists”. However, none of those killed in the attack were armed and no proof has yet been presented that any of those killed were Hamas militants.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/13/palestinian-medic-assad-al-nsasrah-attacked-gaza-detained-israel-says-icrc,1
Airstrike destroys parts of Gaza City hospital as Israel intensifies offensive,"An Israeli airstrike destroyed parts of a hospital in Gaza City early on Sunday, as Israel continued its military offensive in the war-battered Palestinian territory and cut off access to the southern city of Rafah.

The Palestinian civil defence agency said Israel’s air force fired missiles at al-Ahli hospital at around 2am. It was the only hospital still fully functioning in Gaza City after the destruction of medical facilities in the northern area of the strip.

The agency said the bombing “led to the destruction of the surgery building and the oxygen generation station for the intensive care units”.

There were no reports of casualties but the Gaza health ministry said one child died during the rushed evacuation as doctors were unable to provide urgent care.

The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, was among those who condemned the strike, calling it “deplorable”. “Israel’s attacks on medical facilities have comprehensively degraded access to healthcare in Gaza,” Lammy said.

Hospitals, which are protected under international humanitarian law, have repeatedly been hit by Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas on 7 October 2023. The Israeli military has accused Hamas of embedding military operations in hospitals and civilian buildings, which the group has denied.

Al-Ahli hospital is run by the Anglican church in Jerusalem. In a statement, the episcopal diocese of Jerusalem said it was appalled at the airstrike, and said it was the fifth time the hospital had been targeted.

In a statement confirming the strike, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) alleged the hospital was a command and control centre used by Hamas.

“The compound was used by Hamas terrorists to plan and execute terror attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops,” the military said. In a statement in response, Hamas denied the allegations, calling them lies by the IDF “to “justify its savage crimes”.

According to witnesses, doctors and patients were given less than 20 minutes’ warning to evacuate the building before the strike. Video footage circulating online appeared to show people fleeing the building as it was engulfed in smoke and flames. The IDF said it had taken steps to “mitigate harm to civilians” and issued “advance warnings”.

Dr Moataz Harara, the head of the hospital’s emergency department, said of the evacuation: “The scene was heartbreaking and painful. You could see patients walking out on foot or being carried on beds, all of them filled with terror and fear etched on their faces. Women and children were screaming and crying.”

Harara said the hospital had previously been treating between 300 and 500 patients a day, on top of 120 inpatients. But he confirmed Sunday’s attack had left the hospital with a “complete inability to operate” and meant it could no longer accept any new patients. The radiology room and laboratories had also been devastated, he added.

Harara said growing numbers in Gaza were facing a “humanitarian disaster and famine” at the same time as medical facilities were coming under attack.

Since the breakdown of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in March, Gaza’s health sector has been further crippled by a blockade on humanitarian aid, including medical supplies, by the Israeli government.

It has left people facing acute shortages of food, water and medicines, a tactic that rights groups say amounts to a war crime. Israel maintains that enough essential medical supplies have entered Gaza.

Across the strip, Israel continued to escalate its military offensive and vowed to seize large parts of Gaza to put pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages and accept new ceasefire terms. The Gaza health ministry said that 35 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes across Gaza on Sunday.

On Saturday, Israel said it had completed its takeover of a new “security zone” that cut off the southern city of Rafah from the rest of Gaza, part of a wider Israeli operation to establish and expand a security buffer zone across southernmost Gaza where Palestinians are banned from entering.

The defence minister, Israel Katz, announced that Israel’s military had seized the corridor between Rafah and Khan Younis, which he referred to as the “Morag axis”, giving Israel effective control of the area stretching from the Egyptian border to Rafah. Evacuation orders were also given for several neighbourhoods in Khan Younis on Saturday night.

The prewar population of Rafah was about 275,000, which earlier this year expanded to an estimated 1.4 million as Palestinians were displaced from north and central Gaza by Israeli security operations.

But last week Israel once again issued sweeping evacuation orders for all those staying in Rafah, displacing swathes of Gaza’s population of 2 million people. In the last three weeks alone, dozens of evacuation orders have been issued and 400,000 Palestinians told to move, according to the UN.

On Friday, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said more than two-thirds of Gaza was either under active displacement orders or designated as “no-go” zones, where humanitarian groups cannot operate freely. The areas of Gaza that remain habitable continue to shrink and most people are living packed together in squalid tents or the rubble of their homes.

The establishment of Israeli control over crucial corridors in the south and northern areas of Gaza, as well as the expanding security buffer zone, means Israel now controls more than 50% of the strip.

Katz vowed to continue to expand operations “vigorously” across the rest of Gaza. “IDF activity will soon expand strongly to additional locations throughout most of Gaza and you will have to evacuate the fighting zones,” he said.

The statement by Katz urged Palestinians to stand up and remove Hamas and release the remaining hostages, saying: “This is the only way to stop the war.” There was no immediate Hamas response.

Since the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023 on southern Israel, which killed about 1,200 people, Israel’s retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 50,000 people, most of them civilians, according to the territory’s health ministry.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/13/gaza-city-hospital-hit-ahli-baptist-civil-defence-agency-israel-intensifies-military-operations-katz,1
Labour MPs push for Foreign Office to recognise Palestinian statehood,"The Foreign Office is under pressure from Labour MPs to recognise a Palestinian state if Emmanuel Macron, the French president, presses ahead with plans to recognise Palestine at an international conference set for June.

France is co-chairing the conference at the UN in New York alongside Saudi Arabia, and Macron has said the conference must be a decisive moment.

Emily Thornberry, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said the time was coming for the UK to recognise Palestinian statehood, adding: “We need to do it with friends. We need to do it with the French. There are a lot of other countries sitting back and waiting.”

She said that if the west did not act soon, there would be no Palestine left to recognise.

Chris Doyle, the chair of the Council on Arab-British Understanding (CAABU), also backed the measure, saying it should have been done long ago and that such a step by two permanent members of the UN security council would send a powerful message.

He also said that if the UK did not take this step soon it may be too late since Israel was clearly intent on pressing ahead with the effective annexation of the West Bank.

The CAABU has a strong following among Labour MPs, many of whom are furious with Israel’s behaviour in Gaza. There is also anger that two Labour MPs were banned by Israel from visiting the West Bank last week.

The Foreign Office’s formal position is to say it will recognise Palestine at an appropriate moment of maximum impact, but when David Cameron was foreign secretary he marginally advanced the UK policy by affirming that recognition need not come at the end of a process that leads to a two-state solution. In a reference to Israel, he said no state could have a veto over a UK decision to recognise Palestine.

Macron surprised observers last week when he announced he hoped the June conference would act as a trigger for a group of nations to recognise Palestinian statehood, remarks that put clear diplomatic pressure on the UK to follow the French initiative. He told France 5: “We must move toward recognition [of the Palestinian state] and so, in the coming months, we will.”

He added in a reference to some Gulf states including Saudi Arabia: “I also want to participate in a collective dynamic, which must allow all those who defend Palestine to recognise Israel in turn, which many of them do not do.”

The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman – who has personally accused Israel of genocide against the Palestinians – has said Saudi Arabia will only recognise Israel as part of a pact that includes an irreversible path to a Palestinian state.

Although there is scepticism in some British quarters as to how far Macron is prepared to antagonise Israel, personal and political relations between Keir Starmer and Macron are strong. It will be hard for the Foreign Office to resist a strong French push for Palestine’s recognition, especially if it is seen as part of a European-Gulf peace push.

In May last year France chose not to join Spain, Ireland and Norway in recognising Palestine following an overwhelming vote in favour by the UN general assembly. At present 148 of the 193 member countries of the UN have officially recognised Palestinian statehood. So far no western G20 country, including Canada, Italy or Germany, has taken the step.

The Knesset voted heavily last month against a two-state solution, but the leader of the Israeli opposition, Yair Lapid, still sees a medium-term pathway to it so long as Hamas is not part of any Palestinian government.

European recognition would infuriate the US and Israel, but the French argue an alliance with Gulf states may prompt the Trump administration to recalibrate its support for Benjamin Netanyahu.

Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, said on social media: “Unilateral recognition of a fictional Palestinian state … is a reward for terror and a boost to Hamas.”

Faced by the backlash, Macron, writing in Hebrew on the social media site X, claimed he was the victim of a host of unfounded interpretations. He said France’s position was “yes to peace. Yes to Israel’s security. Yes to a Palestinian state without Hamas.”

He wrote: “This requires the release of all hostages, a sustainable ceasefire, the immediate resumption of humanitarian assistance, and the promotion of a two-state political solution. There is no other way but a political solution. I stand for the Palestinians’ legal right to a state and peace, just as I stand for the Israelis’ right to live in peace and security, and while both states are recognised by their neighbours.

“The two-state solution conference in June must be decisive. I am doing everything I can, alongside our partners, to achieve this goal of peace. We need it so much.”

In a sign of the US’s apparent willingness to tolerate the annexation of the West Bank, the US Senate, voting largely along party lines last week, confirmed Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, as US ambassador to Israel. Huckabee has referred to the West Bank by its Jewish biblical names Judea and Samaria. At his confirmation hearing he claimed Donald Trump did not support the enforced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza.

Erdoğan lambasts Israel for undermining stability in Syria,"The Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has lambasted Israel for undermining stability in neighbouring Syria during a diplomatic forum, days after the two countries held talks aimed at defusing an escalating conflict between them on Syrian soil.

“Turkey will not allow Syria to be dragged into a new vortex of instability,” Erdoğan told attendees at the Antalya diplomacy forum on the southern Turkish coast, accusing Israel of “trying to undermine the 8 December revolution”, in reference to the insurgency that toppled the former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad after decades in power.

“We are in close dialogue and in common understanding with all influential actors in the region, especially Mr Trump and Mr Putin, regarding the preservation of Syria’s territorial integrity and stability,” he added.

Attendees at the forum included the Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov as well as Syrian president Ahmed al-Sharaa, who met Erdoğan on the sidelines of the conference in Antalya.

The Turkish presidency said Erdoğan reiterated Ankara’s efforts to lift sanctions on Syria, and told Sharaa that Turkey “welcomes the fact that those who want chaos in Syria to occur again are not given an opportunity”.

Tensions between Israel and Turkey have grown since Assad’s overthrow, peaking after Israeli forces pounded three military bases across Syria with airstrikes earlier this month. Reuters reported that Turkish military teams had scoped out the main airport in Hama province as well as the T4 and Palmyra air bases in Homs, assessing the runways, hangars and infrastructure to see if forces and military hardware could be deployed there as part of a planned joint defence pact between Ankara and Damascus.

The defence minister Israel Katz called airstrikes “a clear message and warning for the future”.

Israel has struck military sites in Syria hundreds of times since Assad fled to Moscow four months ago, destroying military assets including missile systems and air defences that the transitional government in Damascus had hoped to inherit.

Assad’s overthrow marked the end of over 50 years of dictatorial rule by his family, as well as a halt to a decade-long civil war that became a frozen proxy conflict. The former autocrat’s backers Russia and Iran faced off against forces supported by Ankara in northern Syria, and an American military presence in the east and south.

After an insurgency spearheaded by Sharaa’s forces took power in Damascus, Ankara emerged as the most significant regional backer of Syria’s nascent transitional government.

Turkish officials have established fast ties with Damascus, while negotiating a reported defence pact that could see Turkish forces using Syrian airspace and establishing bases on the ground. Israel meanwhile moved to expand its decades-old occupation of the Golan Heights into a designated buffer zone following Assad’s departure.

“Assad had Russia as his protector in the second half of the Syrian civil war. If Turkey comes in and begins installing air defence systems or introducing jets into Syrian airspace, that limits Israel’s freedom of action significantly,” said Aron Lund, an analyst with the New York thinktank Century International.

“For Turkey, the problem now is not just Israel objecting to their military presence but doing things that by design or default are weakening or preventing the emergence of a functioning government in Syria, such as saying the new Sharaa government can’t have forces south of Damascus,” he said.

Israeli military forces infiltrated a remote town in the Daraa countryside south of Damascus earlier this month, with Syrian state media saying nine civilians were killed in shelling during the deepest Israeli incursion into Syria.

Amid few signs that Israeli forces intend to leave the area around Mount Hermon, an Israeli tour company has reportedly begun offering twice-daily hiking tours of the area in cooperation with troops stationed there.

Less than a week after Israel struck three airbases in Syria, the two sides held talks in Azerbaijan aimed at finding ways to defuse growing tensions in Syria. The office of the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a delegation composed of top security and diplomatic officials met their Turkish counterparts, with the two sides agreeing “to continue on the path of dialogue in order to maintain regional stability.”

The Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan told local broadcaster CNN Türk that “while we are conducting certain operations in Syria, there needs to be a deconfliction mechanism with Israel, which flies aircraft in that region, similar to mechanisms we have with the US and Russia.”

Fidan added that technical teams from both sides are in contact “when needed”, in order “to prevent combat elements from misunderstanding each other”.

Lund labelled the talks “a very positive thing”, given the risk of a clash between the two powers in Syria, amid regional conflict including Israel’s 18-month assault on Gaza.

“They will be both be military involved in Syria, and this could spiral in a number of different ways. So some form of red lines or communication channels are essential to managing that tension, and this seems to be a step in that direction,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/12/erdogan-lambasts-israel-for-undermining-stability-in-syria,1
Iran and US agree to continue nuclear talks after first indirect round,"Iran and the US completed a successful opening round of indirect talks in Oman designed to prevent the weaponisation of Iran’s nuclear programme. In a sign the talks over a joint agenda had gone well, they agreed to meet again on 19 April.

A breakdown would have come if Donald Trump had demanded the complete dismantling of Iran’s civil nuclear programme, something that Iran is not prepared to contemplate. Iran insists it is pursuing only a civil nuclear programme, but Donald Trump took the US out of the previous nuclear deal claiming Tehran’s regime was seeking a nuclear weapon.

It appears he is resolved to pursue an updated version of the deal.

The Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said the talks had been “constructive”, and held in a “calm and respectful environment” with “no sharp words exchanged”.

“Both sides don’t want to talk for sake of talking and wasting time, and want to reach a deal as quickly as possible. Both sides showed commitment to take these talks forward until we reach a favourable deal,” he added.

Oman’s foreign minister acted as the mediator in the talks in Muscat, shuttling between Araghchi and Trump’s diplomatic envoy Steve Witkoff.

Witkoff has admitted he does not have technical expertise about civil nuclear disarmament programmes, but Trump implicitly trusts his judgment.

Witkoff also said the discussions had been held in a positive and constructive atmosphere. It is likely the next set of talks will not be held in Muscat, but Oman will retain the role of shuttling between the two negotiating teams in separate rooms.

It is understood that the two diplomats did have a brief exchange at the end of the process, but it was described as not a fully fledged negotiation.

An Iranian condition for the talks was there would be no direct talks with the US while Iran is under US economic sanctions.

But what was more important to the Iranian side was whether Witkoff would demand Iran stop uranium enrichment altogether and end its civil nuclear programme. There was also concern Trump might table demands that Iran stop backing militant groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas.

Witkoff mapped out an agenda apparently similar to the intent behind the 2015 nuclear deal, but that will also have to address the fact that since 2018 Iran has amassed a large stockpile of uranium enriched to 60%, a purity greater than what is required for a civil nuclear programme.

The next round of talks will have to agree how to dispense with this stockpile and how Iran will allow the reintroduction of an independent inspection regime. The UN nuclear weapon inspectorate, the IAEA, has seen its cameras switched off in Iran’s key nuclear sites on successive occasions, making it next to impossible to know what Iran is producing.

Rafael Grossi, the IAEA director general, is due in Iran next week, but it is not clear whether he is yet working in tandem with the small and relatively inexperienced US negotiating team.

Oman’s foreign minister, Badr al-Busaidi, said he was proud to have hosted the talks in Muscat and to have mediated. He said the goal was “a process of dialogue and negotiations with the shared aim of concluding a fair and binding agreement.”

“I would like to thank my two colleagues for this engagement which took place in a friendly atmosphere conducive to bridging viewpoints and ultimately achieving regional and global peace, security and stability. We will continue to work together and put further efforts to assist in arriving at this goal,” he added.

Sina Toossi, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, said “the outcome signals progress. A likely framework is likely now on the table, centred on no weaponisation and sanctions relief.”

Toosi added: “Both sides were likely to sound positive today – even with talks focused on format and agenda – because they currently need the negotiations to continue.



“But without real progress, this dynamic – sustainable in past talks – is unlikely to hold as long this time.”

Ryan Costello, policy director with the National Iranian American Council, said the parties had cleared a low bar today.

He said: “Now, it is important for both the US and Iran to insulate the apparent positive environment of negotiations from those who want to sabotage a move toward a deal.

“Each side should exercise restraint. For the US, this could mean dialling back the military threats. President Trump will also have to make sure that Israel does not go behind the administration’s back and undertake provocative steps that could derail negotiations, including sabotage, as we saw in 2021.

“For Iran, signalling more openness to direct negotiations and ceasing warnings of weaponisation options can help build momentum toward and put a breakthrough in reach.”

With the Iranian economy in freefall, and Iranians suffering energy blackouts, the country’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has always favoured talks with the US as the way to escape “the cage of sanctions”, but he has faced resistance from parliamentary hardliners and parts of the group around the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. On 7 February, Khamenei said experience showed it was “not rational, intelligent or honourable” to hold talks with Trump, a judgment that Pezeshkian said he had no option but to accept.

But the Iranian foreign ministry – supportive of talks – persuaded Khamenei that his regime, already weakened by reverses in Syria, Lebanon and Gaza, might crumble unless he negotiated. Trump also threatened to give Israel the freedom to bomb Iran’s nuclear sites.

To preserve Iran’s dignity, Khamenei insisted the initial talks at least be indirect, but there will be pressure from the US side to allow direct talks. The two countries broke off formal diplomatic relations after the 1979 Iranian revolution.

Pezeshkian, in an effort to talk Trump’s transactional language, said this week: “His excellency [Khamenei] has no opposition to investment by American investors in Iran. American investors: come and invest.”

Trump, too, has relented both in his rhetoric and possibly his demands, saying on Friday: “I’m not asking for much; they can’t have a nuclear weapon,” adding: “I want them to thrive. I want Iran to be a great, wonderful, happy country.” Trump and Witkoff also badly need a diplomatic breakthrough since their peace efforts in Gaza and Ukraine have so far been abject flops. A further war in the Middle East is fiercely resisted by the Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia.

Netanyahu said this week that a deal would only work if Iran’s nuclear facilities were blown up, “under American supervision with American execution”. He also called for a “Libya-style agreement”, a reference to Muammar Gaddafi’s voluntary dismantlement of his nuclear programme under international supervision. But Iran senses that Netanyahu is losing influence with Trump over the nuclear file.

Iran’s deputy foreign minister for political affairs, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, who is involved in parallel talks with European leaders, said: “If the American side does not raise irrelevant issues and demands and puts aside threats and intimidation, there is a good possibility of reaching an agreement. The Islamic republic of Iran believes in dialogue and interaction based on mutual respect, and any bullying and coercion is unacceptable in our view.”

Araghchi, a veteran of the 2015 talks who holds a PhD in political thought from the University of Kent, is accompanied by a technical team.

Iran, which has a reputation for being an exhaustive and exhausting negotiator, knows it is working against a deadline of two months, European officials say, because the UK, Germany and France must signal by the end of July whether they will reimpose punishing UN sanctions against Tehran. The option to reimpose those sanctions, which were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal, will expire on 18 October.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/12/iran-foreign-minister-oman-us-nuclear-programme-talks,1
Arrest warrant issued in Bangladesh for UK MP Tulip Siddiq,"An arrest warrant for the former City minister Tulip Siddiq has been issued in Bangladesh with a new allegation accusing her of illegally receiving a plot of land from her aunt, the ousted former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.

Bangladeshi media reported the warrant was issued by a judge for 53 people connected to Hasina, including Siddiq. There is no formal extradition treaty between the UK and Bangladesh.

Siddiq’s representative said there was “no basis at all for any charges to be made against her, and there is absolutely no truth in any allegation that she received a plot of land in Dhaka through illegal means”.

The MP for Hampstead and Highgate has denied allegations of corruption linked to her aunt’s collapsed regime and accused the Bangladeshi authorities of a “targeted and baseless” campaign against her.

Siddiq resigned in January as economic secretary to the Treasury, citing the risk of becoming a distraction and saying the government was being harmed by the furore over her use of properties given to herself and her family by allies of the regime of Hasina.

She was not deemed by Keir Starmer’s ethics adviser to have broken any rules over her use of the homes and he found no evidence to suggest that any of Siddiq’s assets were derived from anything other than legitimate means.

But Laurie Magnus did find a lack of records and said lapse of time meant he had “not been able to obtain comprehensive comfort in relation to all the UK property-related matters”.

A Conservative party spokesperson said: “If it is the case that Keir Starmer’s choice for anti-corruption minister is the subject of an international arrest warrant for corruption, she should immediately stand down as Labour MP.

“It is shocking that Keir Starmer believes ‘the door remains open’ for Ms Siddiq returning to a government position. Keir Starmer must put his close friendship and association with Ms Siddiq aside and take the action he should have months ago.”

Bangladesh’s anti-corruption commission (ACC) has alleged that Siddiq, 42, received a 670 sq metre plot in the diplomatic zone of the capital, Dhaka, through ties to the former rulers, according to the Sunday Telegraph.

The allegation is that Siddiq persuaded her aunt to allocate three plots of land in the exclusive enclave for her family members, including her mother, Sheikh Rehana, her brother Radwan and her younger sister Azmina. The family are all based in Britain.

The ACC chair, Mohammad Abdul Momen, previously told the BBC the investigations in Bangladesh were “based on documentary evidence of corruption” and Siddiq should return to fight her case in Bangladesh.

In a statement made through her lawyers, Siddiq’s representatives said: “The ACC has made various allegations against Ms Siddiq through the media in the last few months. The allegations are completely false and have been dealt with in writing by Ms Siddiq’s lawyers.

“The ACC has not responded to Ms Siddiq or put any allegations to her directly or through her lawyers. Ms Siddiq knows nothing about a hearing in Dhaka relating to her and she has no knowledge of any arrest warrant that is said to have been issued.

“To be clear, there is no basis at all for any charges to be made against her, and there is absolutely no truth in any allegation that she received a plot of land in Dhaka through illegal means.

“She has never had a plot of land in Bangladesh and she has never influenced any allocation of plots of land to her family members or anyone else.

“No evidence has been provided by the ACC to support this or any other allegation made against Ms Siddiq and it is clear to us that the charges are politically motivated.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/13/tulip-siddiq-uk-mp-arrest-warrant-issued-bangladesh,1
Elderly British couple ‘interrogated 29 times by Taliban’ since imprisonment,"An elderly British couple taken captive by the Taliban have been interrogated 29 times since they were imprisoned more than two months ago, and still have “absolutely no idea” why they have been incarcerated, their daughter has said.

No charges have been brought against Peter Reynolds, 79, and his wife, Barbie, 75, who ran school training programmes and were arrested alongside an American friend, Faye Hall, as they travelled to their home in Bamyan province, in central Afghanistan, in February.

Hall was released last weekend after the Trump administration lifted bounties worth $10m (£7.8m) from the heads of senior Taliban figures, including Sirajuddin Haqqani, the interior minister.

Their daughter, Susie Romer, told Channel 5 that hearing her parents cry on the phone was “excruciating” for her, and called on the UK government to do more to secure their release.

The daughter of Peter and Barbie Reynolds, a British couple currently being held by the Taliban, has told 5 News in an exclusive interview that she urges the UK government to do more to secure their release.



Susie Romer says her parents have lived in Afghanistan for over 18… pic.twitter.com/Rs3gn58rgQ — Channel 5 News (@5_News) April 10, 2025

Romer said that although the British government had been assisting the family, she would like the government to do more to make it clear to the Taliban that her parents “should be immediately released”, she said.

“It’s been 10 weeks now, and we’ve not been reassured that this message has been conveyed, but this is really urgent.

“Each day that they remain in prison, they’re at risk, so we’ll keep on asking the government to send that message.”

The couple have endured 29 interrogations so far, and have now been told “there is not actually a charge against them”, she said.

She described the conditions her parents were being held in as “absolutely horrific”. Mice and cockroaches are “running about” their cells and they receive just one meal a day.

In recordings shared with the Sunday Times last week, Peter Reynolds said: “I’ve been joined up with rapists and murderers by handcuffs and ankle cuffs, including a man who killed his wife and three children, shouting away, a demon-possessed man.”

He said he was living in “a cage rather than a cell”, but described his circumstances as “VIP conditions” compared with where his wife was being held.

During an interview with BBC News last week, the couple’s son, Jonathan Reynolds, said he had been “interacting” with the US government after a video plea to Donald Trump for help to have his parents released.

This week, the Taliban told the Associated Press the case “will soon be resolved” and “should not be a cause for concern”.

A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: “We are supporting the family of two British nationals who are detained in Afghanistan.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/10/peter-barbie-reynolds-british-couple-interrogated-taliban-since-imprisonment,1
US extradites Canadian citizen to India for alleged role in deadly Mumbai attacks,"A Pakistan-born Canadian citizen wanted for his alleged role in the deadly 2008 Mumbai siege has landed in New Delhi after his extradition from the United States.

Tahawwur Hussain Rana, 64, arrived at a military airbase outside the Indian capital under heavily armed guard late on Thursday, and will be held in detention to face trial.

India accuses Rana of being a member of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) group, designated by the United Nations as a terrorist organisation, and of helping to plot the attacks.

The National Investigation Agency said it “secured the successful extradition of … Mumbai terror attack mastermind Tahawwur Rana from the US”.

The extradition took “years of sustained and concerted efforts to bring the key conspirator behind the 2008 mayhem to justice”.

Donald Trump announced in February that Washington would extradite Rana, whom he called “one of the very evil people in the world”.

Rana was flown to India after the US supreme court this month rejected his bid to remain in the United States, where he was serving a sentence related to another LeT-linked attack.

New Delhi blamed the LeT group – as well as intelligence officials from New Delhi’s arch-enemy, Pakistan – for the 2008 Mumbai attacks wherein 10 Islamist gunmen carried out a multiday slaughter in the country’s financial capital, killing 166 people and injuring hundreds more.

India accuses Rana of helping his long-term friend, David Coleman Headley, who was sentenced by a US court in 2013 to 35 years in prison after pleading guilty to aiding LeT militants, including by scouting target locations in Mumbai.

Rana, who denies the charges, is accused of playing a smaller role than Headley, but India maintains he is one of the key plotters.

Rana “is accused of conspiring with David Coleman Headley, and operatives of designated [Pakistan-based] terrorist organisations LeT and Harkat-ul-Jihadi Islami … to carry out the devastating terror attacks,” the NIA said in the statement.

Rana, a former military medic who served in Pakistan’s army, emigrated to Canada in 1997, before moving to the United States and setting up businesses in Chicago, including a law firm and a slaughterhouse.

He was arrested by US police in 2009.

A US court in 2013 acquitted Rana of conspiracy to provide material support to the Mumbai attacks. But the same court convicted him of backing LeT to provide material support to a plot to commit murder in Denmark.

Rana was sentenced to 14 years for his involvement in a conspiracy to attack the offices of the Jyllands-Posten newspaper, which had published cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad.

In February, Devendra Fadnavis, chief minister of Maharashtra state, which includes the megacity Mumbai, said that “finally, the long wait is over and justice will be done”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/10/mumbai-attacks-tahawwur-hussain-rana,1
Apple said to be flying iPhones from India to US to avoid Trump tariffs,"Apple is reportedly chartering cargo flights to ferry iPhones from its Indian manufacturing plants to the US in an attempt to beat Donald Trump’s tariffs.

The tech company has flown 600 tonnes of iPhones, or as many as 1.5m handsets, to the US from India since March after ramping up production at its plants in the country, according to Reuters.

Trump’s threatened tariffs of 26% on Indian imports are on hold for about three months after the US president called a 90-day pause, but he has announced that tariffs on goods from China – where Apple assembles most of its iPhones – will be subject to a levy of at least 145%.

A source familiar with the planning behind the move told Reuters Apple “wanted to beat the tariff”. Imports to the US from India still face a tariff under Trump’s policy but at the reduced rate of 10%.

Analysts have warned iPhone prices could surge after the US imposed its highest tariff on imports from China, with the investment bank UBS estimating an iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB of storage could increase in price by more than two-thirds from $1,199 (£925) to nearly $2,000 if Apple passes on a substantial chunk of the tariff costs.

Reuters reported that Apple had targeted a 20% increase in production at iPhone plants in India. It did this by increasing the number of workers, and temporarily extending operations at the biggest Foxconn India factory in Chennai to Sundays.

The Chennai plant produced 20m iPhones last year, including the latest iPhone 15 and 16 models. Apple has three plants in India operated by Foxconn and Tata.

The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Apple planned to send more iPhones to the US from India as a “short-term stopgap” while the company attempted to secure an exemption from the China tariffs. If Apple diverted all India-made iPhones to the US it would account for about 50% of American demand this year, according to the Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan.

Analysts have warned that moving iPhone production to the US would be prohibitively expensive because of factors such as the cost of paying hundreds of thousands of workers. Analysts at Wedbush Securities, a US financial services company, have said a US-made iPhone would cost $3,500.

EU urged to put human rights centre stage at first central Asia summit,"The EU is being urged to put human rights centre stage as it begins its first summit with the leaders of central Asia.

The president of the European Council, António Costa, and the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, are meeting the leaders of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan on Friday.

Hosted by Uzbekistan’s president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, the group will discuss trade, counter-terrorism, climate and energy ties in Samarkand, a stop on the ancient Silk Road linking Asia and the west that is now a symbol of rapid development in the region.

Ties between the EU and the former Soviet republics of central Asia have intensified since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The two sides have pledged to improve transport links, through a project known as the trans-Caspian transport corridor, which aims to cut the overland journey between the EU and central Asia by half, down to no more than 15 days. Brussels also hopes for endorsement of a text on critical raw materials that are abundant in the region and needed for the EU’s green transition.

One senior EU official said it was “a landmark summit” and that central Asian countries showed “a corresponding wish to deepen the relationship with the EU and to diversify their foreign policy”.

Ahead of the summit, the most complex issue – for the central Asian countries – was how to refer to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the final declaration. Kazakhstan, once one of Russia’s closes allies, has sent humanitarian aid to Ukraine, maintained contact with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and banned Russian military propaganda symbols. Kazakhstan, however, joined Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in abstaining on a recent UN general assembly vote calling for “peaceful resolution of the war in Ukraine”.

The European parliament has also raised concerns about Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan being “possible hubs” allowing Russia to circumvent western sanctions.

Amid shifting geopolitical alliances and the scramble for mineral wealth, campaigners are urging the EU not to overlook human rights.

“These new partnerships are very important, but they will not be sustainable and will not really secure the EU’s interests unless the EU also cares about rule of law in the region and protection of rights,” Iskra Kirova, of Human Rights Watch, said.

The EU, she added, was not using its leverage in a credible way. She questioned the union’s decision to sign a wide-ranging trade and cooperation deal with Kyrgyzstan last June, after Bishkek adopted a Russian-style “foreign representatives” law that requires NGOs receiving funds from abroad to bear this designation. The law stigmatises organisations and has had a “very chilling effect” on Kyrgyz civil society, Kirova said.

The EU “does not insist that there will be concrete achievements before it grants these kinds of straight benefits or bilateral agreements”, she said, referring also to preferential trade deals.

A senior EU official said a plan for criminal sanctions in the original Kyrgyz NGO bill had been dropped following EU intervention, adding this was “a major difference” with similar laws in Russia and Belarus. “We are not going there to preach,” a second official said. “But the more we have a dialogue and engagement and interaction, the more we believe that we can change and improve all the things that concern us.”

Maisy Weicherding at Amnesty International said the EU needed to set an example by ensuring “human rights due diligence” was part of any infrastructure project, listing actions including environmental and climate impact assessments, consulting local people and ensuring no forced displacement.

Such due diligence would be crucial in Uzbekistan, she said, where a UN special rapporteur found in 2024 that large numbers of people were being forced out of their homes to make way for large-scale redevelopment. “It is really imperative that [the EU] do not just go in and endorse repressive practices in these countries but try and insist proper human rights procedures are followed.”

The summit host, Mirziyoyev, became Uzbekistan’s president in 2016, after the death of the dictator Islam Karimov. He has introduced reforms, including clamping down on forced labour in cotton fields. Rights groups say his government allows no dissent and voting remains tightly controlled, such as in a recent referendum introducing constitutional changes that will enable Mirziyoyev to remain in power until 2040.

Jana Toom, the vice-chair of the European parliament’s delegation for central Asia, said central Asian countries were not doing enough to stop circumvention of EU sanctions against Russia, although she added that they had not made any commitments on this score.

Asked whether the EU was striking the right balance between economic interests and human rights, the Estonian liberal MEP said: “I believe that if we have beneficial cooperation between the European Union and central Asia, things will improve. It will take time, of course. And we have to take into account also the fact where they find themselves: between Russia and China, and they are trying to balance.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/04/eu-urged-to-put-human-rights-centre-stage-at-first-central-asia-summit,1
US tourist arrested for landing on forbidden Indian tribal island,"Indian police said on Thursday they had arrested a US tourist who sneaked on to a highly restricted island carrying a coconut and a can of Diet Coke to a tribe untouched by the industrial world.

Mykhailo Viktorovych Polyakov, 24, set foot on the restricted territory of North Sentinel – part of India’s Andaman Islands – in an attempt to meet the Sentinelese people, who are believed to number only about 150.

All outsiders, Indians and foreigners alike, are banned from travelling within 3 miles (5km) of the island to protect the Indigenous people from outside diseases and to preserve their way of life.

“The American citizen was presented before the local court after his arrest and is now on a three-day remand for further interrogation,” the Andaman and Nicobar Islands police chief, HGS Dhaliwal, told AFP.

Satellite photographs show a coral reef-fringed island – stretching to some 6 miles at its widest point – with thick forest and white sand beaches.

The Sentinelese last made international headlines in 2018 after they killed John Allen Chau, 27, an American missionary who landed illegally on their beach.

Chau’s body was not recovered and there were no investigations over his death because of the Indian law prohibiting anyone from going to the island.

India sees the wider Andaman and Nicobar Islands as strategically sited on key global shipping lanes. They are closer to Myanmar than mainland India.

New Delhi plans to invest at least $9bn (£6.7bn) to expand naval and airbases, troop accommodation, the port and the main city in the region.

Dhaliwal said Polyakov kept blowing a whistle off the shore of North Sentinel Island for about an hour to attract the tribe’s attention before he went ashore.

“He landed briefly for about five minutes, left the offerings on the shore, collected sand samples, and recorded a video before returning to his boat,” Dhaliwal said. “A review of his GoPro camera footage showed his entry and landing into the restricted North Sentinel Island.”

Police said Polyakov was arrested late on Monday, about two days after he went ashore, and had visited the region twice in recent months.

He first used an inflatable kayak in October 2024 but was stopped by hotel staff, police said on Thursday. Polyakov made another unsuccessful attempt during a visit in January 2025.

This time Polyakov used another inflatable boat with a motor to travel the roughly 35 kilometres (22 miles) of open sea from the main archipelago.

The Sentinelese, whose language and customs remain a mystery to outsiders, shun all contact and have a record of hostility to anyone who tries to get close.

A photograph issued by the Indian coastguard and Survival International two decades ago showed a Sentinelese man aiming a bow and arrow at a passing helicopter.

Indian authorities have prosecuted any locals who have aided attempts to enter the island and are trying to identify anyone who may have helped Polyakov.

The Andamans are also home to the 400-strong Jarawa tribe, who activists say are also threatened by contact from outsiders. Tourists have previously bribed local officials in an attempt to spend time with the Jarawa.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/03/us-tourist-arrested-for-landing-on-forbidden-indian-tribal-island,1
No 10 ‘confident’ on securing supplies to keep Scunthorpe furnaces burning – UK politics live,"From 3h ago 14.08 CEST Government remains 'confident' it will secure supply of materials needed to keep Scunthorpe blast furnaces burning The government remains “confident” it will secure the supply of materials needed to keep blast furnaces burning at the Scunthorpe steel plant, Downing Street has said. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said: “We are now confident in securing the supply of materials needed. Obviously we will be working with the management to identify further raw materials needed to keep a steady pipeline, and to keep the furnaces burning. “I’m not going to get ahead of what comes next, but we’ll obviously now work on the issues of ownership.” The spokesperson added there are two ships carrying materials docked at Immingham port in North Lincolnshire, with “a third ship which is currently en route off the coast of Africa, which will be making its way to the UK”. The spokesperson would not say whether money had been exchanged for the materials, and said they would reach the plant in the “coming days”. Downing Street also attempted to play down claims that there had been deliberate “sabotage” of steel-making efforts at the plant, saying: No, we’re not aware of any deliberate acts of sabotage. But as the business secretary and the industry minister said over the weekend, [during] the talks that we were engaging with the Chinese owners [it] became clear that they wanted to shut the blast furnaces. That wasn’t an outcome that we wanted to see. They had decided not to order more raw materials. Earlier China’s foreign ministry warned the UK not to “politicise” trade cooperation or “link it to security issues” in order “not to impact the confidence of Chinese enterprises in going to the UK.” Share Updated at 14.13 CEST

10m ago 16.36 CEST Jessica Murray Our social affairs correspondent Jessica Murray has this report on the vote to reject a deal that end the Birmingham bin strike Bin workers have “overwhelmingly” rejected a deal that would have ended an all-out strike in Birmingham, during which bin bags have piled up in the streets and the city has faced an influx of rats. Negotiations between the council and Unite, representing the striking workers, have stalled for months, and refuse workers have been on indefinite strike since 11 March. On Monday, workers were balloted on a “partial deal on pay protection for a few”, according to the Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham. Workers voted overwhelmingly to reject the deal, the union said. “The rejection of the offer is no surprise as these workers simply cannot afford to take pay cuts of this magnitude to pay the price for bad decision after bad decision,” said Graham. “The government must now call a meeting with the stakeholders to ensure these steps are taken to bring the strike to an end. The government must now also urgently consider Unite’s proposal for debt restructure at Birmingham city council and other local authorities. Workers and communities cannot continue to pay the price.” Birmingham bin workers reject deal to end strike Read more Share

13m ago 16.32 CEST Deputy prime minister Angela Rayner has been asked about the deployment of logistical help from the army to tackle a backlog of waste refuse in Birmingham. She said: There’s no boots on the ground, let me be very clear, we’ve deployed a couple of army logistics to help with the logistical operation of clearing up the rubbish. We’ve got over two-thirds of the rubbish cleared off the streets now, this week we’ll start to see cleaning up the pavements and streets as well as the clearance of all of that rubbish, I’m very pleased about that. The kids are off school, obviously it’s Easter holidays, we want that rubbish cleared.

21m ago 16.24 CEST Unite rejects pay offer in Birmingham refuse worker dispute Refuse workers in Birmingham have voted to reject a “totally inadequate” offer from the city council aimed at ending a long-running strike over pay, union Unite said, PA Media reports. Unite said the deal would have included “substantial” pay cuts for workers and did not address potential pay cuts for 200 drivers. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: “For weeks, these workers have faced attacks from government and their employer pushing the lie that only a handful of workers are affected by the council’s plans to cut pay by up to £8,000. “Instead of peddling untruths about these low paid workers and focusing on winning a media war, the government should have taken the time to check facts and used its office to bring the council to the table in a meaningful way. “The rejection of the offer is no surprise as these workers simply cannot afford to take pay cuts of this magnitude to pay the price for bad decision after bad decision.” Share

44m ago 16.01 CEST Jasper Jolly The largest steelworkers’ union has welcomed the promotion of two British Steel veterans to lead the company under government control. The Community union said it welcomed the appointments of Allan Bell as chief executive and Lisa Coulson as chief commercial officer, after a near-total breakdown in relations between workers and British Steel’s Chinese owners, Jingye. Assistant general secretary Alasdair McDiarmid added “We have enjoyed a constructive relationship with Allan and Lisa in their previous roles, and we know that they will fulfil the government’s ambition of maintaining reliable and professional leadership on site. The focus now must be on securing the continued operation of the blast furnaces and delivering a brighter future for British Steel.” Jingye remains the owner of British Steel, but ministers have acknowledged that full nationalisation remains an option. Many people in the industry expect it to be the next step, as Jingye’s has proven unwilling to invest. In an earlier statement, Bell said “Our immediate priorities are securing the raw materials we need to continue blast furnace operations, ensuring we have the dedicated personnel to run those furnaces, and maintaining the highest levels of health and safety for our workforce.” Share

47m ago 15.59 CEST I mentioned earlier that the Conservative party were pushing waste collection in Birmingham as a local election issue ahead of polling in some regions of England on 1 May. Opposition leader Kemi Badenoch has just issued a video of her meeting residents in Birmingham. In it she says: I’m standing in a park in Birmingham that should be full of children playing. Instead, it’s full of rubbish, needles, rotten food. This is not what life is supposed to be like. This is what Labour run Birmingham looks like and the people here are suffering because of Labour incompetence. We need to do better for our local residents. That’s why I’m telling people to vote Conservative for better services. You can’t just hope for a better Council, you’ve got to vote for one. The local elections [in some regions of England] are coming up. And if you don’t want your community to end up like this one, there’s only one credible alternative, and that’s the Conservative party. In the video residents are seen complaining about council tax rises and the closures of local libraries. Kemi goes to Birmingham to investigate the rat-infested trash piles plaguing local residents.



What she found was shocking 👇pic.twitter.com/qTbCPkvtPJ — Conservatives (@Conservatives) April 14, 2025 The Conservative party have also claimed on social media that “the rubbish piling up on Birmingham streets now weighs as much as two Eiffel Towers”, although it isn’t entirely clear how they have calculated that. Keir Starmer’s social media output has also been in campaigning mode, although in his case he is aiming to champion success in government policy on the NHS in England. The prime minister’s message in the last couple of minutes was: Over three million more appointments delivered. Over 1,500 new GPs recruited. Over 100,000 more people treated on time. Over 80% of patients having cancer ruled out or diagnosed within 28 days. Waiting lists down for the sixth month in a row. Our plan for change is working. Share

2h ago 15.12 CEST Tulip Siddiq has claimed allegations by Bangladeshi authorities against her are a “politically motivated smear campaign” and insisted there is “no evidence that I’ve done anything wrong”. PA Media reports that speaking to reporters on Monday, the Hampstead and Highgate Labour MP said: “no one from the Bangladeshi authorities has contacted me. The entire time they’ve done trial by media. “My lawyers proactively wrote to the Bangladeshi authorities, they never responded. I’m sure you’ll understand I can’t dignify this politically motivated smear campaign It’s a completely politically motivated smear campaign, trying to harass me – there is no evidence that I’ve done anything wrong.” Siddiq resigned from her post in the Treasury earlier this year after an investigation by the prime minister’s ethics adviser into her links to her aunt, the ousted former prime minister Sheikh Hasina Yesterday it was reported An arrest warrant for the former City minister Tulip Siddiq has been issued in Bangladesh with a new allegation accusing her of illegally receiving a plot of land from Hasina. Bangladeshi media reported the warrant was issued by a judge for 53 people connected to Hasina, including Siddiq. There is no formal extradition treaty between the UK and Bangladesh. Share

2h ago 14.49 CEST Scotland must not be an “afterthought” for the UK government, John Swinney has said, as he called for the Grangemouth refinery to be nationalised. Speaking at a press conference on Monday, the first minister said: “If British Steel is to be nationalised to protect it, then so too should Grangemouth. I’m determined to make sure that Scotland is not viewed as an afterthought.” Owners Petroineos announced plans to shutter the Grangemouth refinery last year and it was confirmed in recent weeks that 377 workers have accepted voluntary redundancy, with a further 28 compulsory redundancies. PA Media quotes a Petroineos spokesperson saying: “If governments had wanted to seriously consider different ownership models, the time to start that work was five years ago when we first alerted them to the challenges at the refinery. We have also been clear throughout about the fundamental operational challenges and the scale of losses incurred.” Share

2h ago 14.38 CEST The government has issued a further comment on the decision by authorities in Hong Kong to refuse entry to Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse. It said: During his visit to mainland China and Hong Kong, minister for trade policy and economic security Douglas Alexander relayed our immediate and deep concern regarding MP Wera Hobhouse’s denial of entry into Hong Kong. Minister Alexander raised our concerns and demanded an explanation with senior Chinese and Hong Kong interlocutors, including Hong Kong’s chief secretary for administration, to understand why the Hong Kong authorities refused access to a British MP. It is deeply concerning that a UK MP was refused permission to enter Hong Kong last week. Unjustified restrictions on the freedom of movement for UK citizens into Hong Kong only serves to further undermine Hong Kong’s international reputation and the important people-people connections between the UK and Hong Kong. As the foreign secretary has made clear and Minister Alexander relayed in person, it would be unacceptable for any MP to be denied entry for simply expressing their views.

2h ago 14.25 CEST Downing Street was also asked earlier to comment on the latest situation with waste disposal in Birmingham, where office-based military specialists have been called in to deal with the mounting piles of rubbish on the streets. PA Media reports the prime minister’s official spokesperson said: The residents of Birmingham are our first and foremost priority. That’s why we’ve provided a number of staff to support the council to help get the streets cleaned up and address the public health risks. This includes coordinating the local response with local authorities, providing additional vehicles and crews, and opening household waste centres to Birmingham residents and, as set out over the weekend, a handful of office-based military personnel are supporting operational planning and have made themselves available to the council to support. And as the deputy prime minister has said, we are now urging Unite to suspend its action and accept the offer that is on the table. Downing Street said there “no plans” to bring in frontline personnel, and claimed that more than 100 vehicles had left depots on Monday morning. Earlier the Conservative party attempted to use the issue as part of their campaign for the local elections taking place in some parts of England on 1 May. In a message posted to social media, the party said “Labour have lost control of Britain’s second city. Now Keir Starmer is being forced to call in the ARMY to bail out his failing Labour-run council.” Earlier this year, when proposing its budget, Cllr John Cotton, leader of Birmingham city council, said “Birmingham city council is facing a number of financial challenges. Our situation has been made much worse by a national crisis in local government finance.” “A combination of austerity and underfunding – Birmingham has lost over £1bn in funding since 2011 – added to a rising demand for services and inflation mean that, across the country local authorities are facing some of the biggest budget challenges in living memory.” Share

Prison Service bans dangerous inmates from kitchens after officers attacked,"The Prison Service is to suspend the use of kitchens for the most dangerous inmates after the brother of the Manchester Arena bomber attacked three officers at HMP Frankland.

Hashem Abedi, a convicted terrorist who was jailed for life after helping his suicide-bomber brother Salman Abedi carry out the Manchester Arena attack in 2017, set upon staff with hot cooking oil and blades made out of cooking trays.

Two male prison officers remain seriously ill in hospital after the attack on Saturday. A female colleague was treated in hospital and discharged.

The Prison Service will consider whether the ban on inmates in separation units using kitchens should be made permanent.

Police investigating the attack are talking to prosecutors about possible charges, believed to include attempted murder.

The Ministry of Justice, which is responsible for prisons in England and Wales, would not say where Abedi was now being held. The investigation into the attack is being led by counter-terrorism officers, but police are keeping an open mind about the motive.

Abedi is understood not to be under formal arrest. This avoids detectives facing time limits to complete key stages of their investigation, while any risk their suspect poses is mitigated by the fact that he is already behind bars and isolated.

A Downing Street spokesperson said: “The prime minister is appalled by the attack that we saw at the weekend, and his thoughts with the officers involved. Prison staff work around the clock to keep the country safe, and we will never tolerate the violence that is targeted towards them.

Prisoner at HMP Whitemoor arrested on suspicion of murdering convicted killer,"A prisoner has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a convicted killer at a high-security prison.

John Mansfield, who was jailed for life in 2007 for the murder of his 63-year-old neighbour, was found dead at HMP Whitemoor near March, Cambridgeshire, on Sunday.

A 44-year-old serving prisoner has been arrested on suspicion of murdering Mansfield, 63, at the jail.

Mansfield, then aged 45, was sentenced in 2007 at Manchester crown court to life in prison with a minimum term of 30 years for the murder of Ann Alfanso. In August 2006, she was found dead with 20 stab wounds in the head and neck at her home in Whalley Range, Manchester, by her carer, who supported her with her reduced mobility.

In 2014, Mansfield was handed a second life term after stabbing another prisoner with a broken plate at HMP Full Sutton, near York.

A Cambridgeshire police spokesperson said officers were called at about 4.10pm on Sunday “following the discovery of the body of a man in his 60s at HMP Whitemoor near March”, and confirmed that the arrested man was a serving prisoner.

They said: “A 44-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder. An investigation is ongoing.”

A Prison Service spokesperson said: “Police are investigating the death of prisoner John Mansfield at HMP Whitemoor on Sunday 13 April. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.”

The prison and probation ombudsman is required to launch an investigation into the incident.

This is the second security breach to take place in UK prisons within a week. On 12 April, the Manchester bomb plotter Hashem Abedi is alleged to have attacked three prison officers at HMP Frankland in County Durham. The officers suffered life-threatening injuries after they were attacked with hot oil and homemade weapons, according to the trade union covering prison staff.

The Ministry of Justice has said it would carry out a review into how the incident was allowed to happen.

Mark Fairhurst, the chair of the Prison Officers’ Association, said the incident highlighted the dangerous realities of being a prison officer and argued that more investment was needed from the Treasury in order to improve working conditions.

He said: “We deal with exactly the same incidents as police officers, exactly the same violence, the same hostilities, yet we don’t have the same protections. We don’t even have stab-proof vests.”",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/14/hmp-whitemoor-arrest-murder-convicted-killer,1
"Rightwing media falsely blame Ed Miliband for UK steel crisis, experts say","Ed Miliband and the UK’s net zero target are being falsely blamed for the UK’s steel crisis, experts have said.

On Saturday, parliament passed a law containing emergency powers to gain control of the last remaining maker of mass-produced virgin steel in England, based in Scunthrope, after its Chinese owner, Jingye, declined government support to keep the plant running over the next few weeks.

Some parliamentarians and media commentators placed the blame for Britain’s declining steel industry on the energy secretary, claiming that his net zero policies and lack of support for a proposed coalmine in Cumbria had made the energy and coking coal used to make steel more expensive.

During Saturday’s debate, the shadow business secretary, Andrew Griffith, said: “No one is more responsible for this than the energy secretary and the prime minister who appointed him.”

Andrew Neil blamed Miliband and what the broadcaster described as “net zero nonsense”, saying: “And now Miliband has the audacity to pose as the saviour of British steelworkers. In truth, the British political class has shamefully failed them, none more so than net zero zealot Miliband.”

The rightwing media were critical of Miliband, with calls for him to be reshuffled from his position and several pieces blaming the energy secretary for the perilous position of the Scunthorpe site.

But experts have said this characterisation is completely false. Prof Rob Gross, the director of the UK Energy Research Centre said: “The clean power mission can actually help save the steel industry.

“High energy prices in the UK undoubtedly play a role in the problems faced by steelmakers. But high energy prices are absolutely not created by net zero policies. Britain is acutely exposed to fluctuations in gas prices, and the gas price also drives UK electricity prices more than in other countries.

“Britain’s amazing wind resources offer the potential for cheap, stable energy prices. We need to build the infrastructure of clean power so we can have cheap power for decades. The drive for clean energy also creates a large demand for steel, for wind farms, nuclear power stations and pylons.”

Conservative and Reform UK MPs claimed the cancellation of a coalmine in Cumbria had led to the decline of British steel. The Tory MP Graham Stuart said: “We have a government which is shipping coking coal from Japan when it was perfectly possible to have the greenest production of coking coal in the world in Cumbria with thousands of jobs.” Richard Tice, the deputy leader of Reform, said the government had “declined” the “opportunity to use British coal from Cumbria”.

But the coking coal that was to be produced from this mine would not have been of a high enough quality to be used in the Scunthorpe steelworks, with at least 85% of it earmarked for export. This is because of its high sulphur content.

Jess Ralston, the head of energy at the not-for-profit Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “Lingering but persistent high energy prices, triggered by gas prices soaring around the invasion of Ukraine, have been the final straw for Scunthorpe and Port Talbot. The reality is that net zero actually means energy independence from volatile gas markets influenced by foreign actors like [Vladimir] Putin.

“British Steel itself admitted that it couldn’t use coking coal from the proposed coalmine in Cumbria on its own because the sulphur content is too high, and the mine operators admitted that 85% of the product would be exported, so it’s far from the silver bullet that some are claiming it is.”

Ralston added that the British steel industry had been in long-term decline since the 1970s, when Miliband was a child, and decades before net zero was signed into law. In 1971, there were approximately 323,000 steel workers in the UK. By 2014, that figure had dropped to 34,500.

A Labour source pointed out that UK Steel said last year: “The main driver of the price disparity is now wholesale electricity costs, driven by the UK’s reliance on natural gas power generation.” They added that gas set the price 98% of the time in the UK, compared with about 40% on average across the EU.

The source said: “Our mission is for clean power by 2030 because clean, homegrown energy is the best way to protect billpayers and boost Britain’s energy independence. We are already bringing energy costs closer in line with other major economies through the British industry supercharger, which reduces network charges by 60%. This fully exempts eligible firms from certain costs linked to renewable energy policies, particularly those exposed to the high cost of electricity, such as steel.”

Other countries including Germany, Sweden and China have industrial strategies to subsidise steel and keep the industry going. Experts said the UK’s failure to have a strategy for steel was the problem, rather than net zero.

"Don’t politicise row over Scunthorpe steel plant, says Chinese foreign ministry","China has urged the British government not to “politicise” the row over the Scunthorpe steel plant, saying that doing so could deter Chinese companies from investing in the UK.

A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry said on Monday that Jingye, the Beijing-based owner of British Steel, had acted as a commercial business when it tried to shut down the plant, not as an arm of the Chinese government.

The ministry issued its warning after an unprecedented intervention from the British government, which has taken control of the site and is trying to secure enough supplies to keep its two blast furnaces in operation.

The Chinese foreign ministry’s spokesperson, Lin Jian, told a briefing in Beijing that the UK should “avoid politicising trade cooperation or linking it to security issues, so as not to impact the confidence of Chinese enterprises in going to the UK”.

He added: “When it comes to the operational difficulties currently faced by British Steel, the two sides should negotiate a solution on the basis of mutual benefit.”

Lin also said Beijing wanted the British government to “treat Chinese businesses that have invested and operate in the UK fairly and justly, (and) protect their legitimate and lawful rights and interests”.

He added that the company was “a Chinese private enterprise that has undertaken cooperation with the British side based on market principles”.

Ministers have accused Jingye of acting in bad faith last week, as the company negotiated a bailout package with the government while also trying to sell shipments of raw materials that would have kept the plant open.

Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, refused to rule out the idea that Jingye’s actions could have been a deliberate act of sabotage against British steelmaking on Sunday – though he added it could have been a case of “neglect”.

However, Downing Street on Monday dismissed suggestions the company might have been motivated by a political desire from Beijing to damage Britain’s industrial base.

A spokesperson said: “We’re not aware of any deliberate acts of sabotage. But as the business sector, and I think the industry minister, said over the weekend, in the talks that we were engaging with the Chinese owners, it became clear that they wanted to shut the blast furnaces.

“Obviously this relates to a commercial Chinese company, rather than a state-owned company.”

No 10 also insisted it had robust processes in place to check Chinese investment in British infrastructure. Those planned investments include the Bradwell B nuclear plant in Essex, where Chinese General Nuclear Power remains a lead ­developer.

A Downing Street spokesperson said: “When it comes to critical national infrastructure, we have rigorous processes and rules in place for managing our national security. Particularly when it comes to investment in our energy sector, those sorts of investments are subject to the highest levels of national security scrutiny.”

Ministers are in a race against time to keep Scunthorpe’s two blast furnaces operating, given that they will become impossible to restart should they run out of fuel and cool down too much.

The blast furnaces require materials including iron ore and coking coal. One person briefed on the situation said the company had made payments for some materials that had been held at the nearby port of Immingham.

No 10 said on Monday that ministers were confident they had secured two shipments of iron ore and coking coal. It said the shipments were docked 30 miles east of Scunthorpe and were expected to be delivered in the coming days.

Reynolds has also signed off on the decision to appoint two veterans of the Scunthorpe site to lead the company after the government’s takeover. Allan Bell will become the interim chief executive and Lisa Coulson will be interim chief commercial officer.

A company source said: “These were the serious people that kept the place running.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/14/dont-politicise-row-over-scunthorpe-steel-plant-says-chinese-foreign-ministry,1
Blue Origin crew including Katy Perry safely returns to Earth after space flight,"Six women – including the pop star Katy Perry and morning TV host Gayle King – safely completed a trip to the edge of outer space and back from a private Texas ranch on Monday morning on a rocket belonging to Jeff Bezos, the Amazon co-founder and commercial space flight entrepreneur.

The women, who also included Bezos’s fiancee, Lauren Sánchez, made the trip to the Kármán line – the internationally recognized boundary of space – to float about, weightlessly, in the rocket’s capsule for three minutes before returning to Earth.

“Yeah baby, go for launch,” a mission controller could be heard saying shortly before the single-engine New Shepard rocket blasted off on time, at 8.30am local time (9.30am ET and 13.30am GMT).

King’s longtime friend, the TV talk-show host Oprah Winfrey, was on hand in Texas for the launch. Winfrey remarked that, for King, “this is bigger than just going to space” and “more than just overcoming fear”.

“Life is about continuing into grow into the fullest expression of yourself,” Winfrey said.

The talk-show queen could later be seen rubbing her eyes as the rocket reached its maximum ascent velocity of 2,300mph – or Mach 3. A commentator remarked that the vehicle was rising into the atmosphere ahead of “a stream of steam”.

As the rocket reached its highest point, about 62 miles (100km) above the Earth, a passenger could be heard to exclaim: “Oh my goddess.” Another could be heard saying: “I love you, Jeff Bezos.”

On the way back down to earth, more screaming could be heard. The capsule, detached from its booster, made a soft landing on the Texas plains, two miles from the launchpad.

“Congratulations, and welcome back to earth,” the commentator said. “Everybody just as ecstatic to be back on Earth.”

Sánchez’s fiancee later opened the hatch to welcome her back to earth, followed by her crewmates. The billionaire greeted each with a hug and kiss.

Perry, holding a daisy, kissed the ground with King. In a post-flight interview, Sánchez said: “The Earth was so quiet but also really alive. We are all in this together, and some connected. It makes me just want to hug everybody.”

“I had to come back,” Sánchez, who is set to marry Bezos this summer in Venice, added tearfully. “I wanted to come back. I’m getting married.”

The alternative, she said, “would be a bummer for me”.

Perry, 40, said last week she was listening to an audiobook of Cosmos by Carl Sagan and reading a book on string theory in preparation for the ride.

“I’ve always been interested in astrophysics and interested in astronomy and astrology and the stars,” she told the Associated Press. “We are all made of stardust, and we all come from the stars.”

The pop star also said that she planned to channel “that feminine divine that I was born with” to prepare for the new experience.

Before liftoff, King – who co-hosts CBS Mornings – said she was approaching the rocket trip with trepidation. “I still get very uncomfortable when people say ‘astronaut’,” she said. “I in no means feel like an astronaut. They said: ‘But, Gayle, if you go to space, you’re an astronaut.”

The pair, along with former Nasa rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen and film producer Kerianne Flynn, traveled as the guests of Sánchez.

The flight was the 11th human flight for the New Shepard program, which has flown 52 people, including repeat astronauts, about the Kármán line.

Some critics have questioned whether the all-female trip is a moment of feminist progress since it comes as promotion for Bezos’s space tourism business that, in turn, is the marketing arm of Blue Origin’s commercial launch program.

The US actor Olivia Munn called the trip “a bit gluttonous” during a guest hosting appearance on Today with Jenna & Friends on CBS rival NBC.

“I know this is not the cool thing to say, but there are so many other things that are so important in the world right now,” Munn said. “What are you guys going to do up in space?”",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/apr/14/blue-origin-rocket-launch,1
New York helicopter tour operator behind fatal crash shuts down,"The company that operated the helicopter that crashed into New York City’s Hudson River on Thursday – killing all six people on board – has been shuttered with immediate effect, the US’s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said late on Sunday.

New York Helicopter Tours is “shutting down their operations immediately”, the FAA said in a statement on X. The agency added that it would launch a review of the company’s license and safety records in the meantime.

The tour operator was already the subject of an investigation from the National Transportation Safety Board, which said that the doomed helicopter – a Bell 206L-4 LongRanger IV – was not equipped with any flight data recording equipment.

It was on its eighth tour flight of the day when it crashed into the river near Hoboken, New Jersey, after taking off from Manhattan for an aerial tour of New York City.

Those killed in the crash were the pilot and his passengers: a family of five visiting from Spain.

The family members included the Siemens executive Agustín Escobar, 49, and his wife, Mercè Camprubí Montal, who was celebrating her 40th birthday at the time of the helicopter crash. The couple were joined by their three children: Víctor, 4; Mercedes, 8; and Agustín, 10.

The pilot, 36-year-old Seankese Johnson, was a US navy veteran who qualified as a commercial pilot in 2023 with more than 800 hours’ flying time.

News of the company’s closure came after Senator Chuck Schumer of New York urged the FAA to rescind New York Helicopter Tours’ operating certificate. The senator also called for the company’s operators to “cease their flights until the investigation is complete”.

“There is one thing for sure about New York City’s helicopter tour companies: they have a deadly track record,” Schumer at a Sunday news conference.

He added: “Eleven people killed in the last few years, and it is usually the companies, not the pilots, that are openly manipulating FAA rules, cutting corners and could well be putting profits over people.”

The company’s website was still online on Monday with a message to say it is “profoundly saddened by the tragic accident and loss of life that occurred on April 10, 2025, involving one of our helicopters in the Hudson River”.

The crash has drawn attention to the safety of civilian helicopter flights around Manhattan. The New York City mayor, Eric Adams has dismissed discussion of a blanket ban on helicopter tours in the city.

“That is part of the attraction of businesses being in the city, people coming to the city, seeing the city from the air,” Adams told NBC after the crash. “What we must do is make sure it’s safe, make sure it’s done correctly.”

But on the other side of the Hudson River, in New Jersey, opposition to air tourism is mounting, including from the mayor of Jersey City, which is just across the Hudson River from New York City.

“I think any reasonable person would come to the conclusion that the amount of air traffic over New York City and New Jersey – particularly Jersey City – is problematic,” the Jersey City mayor, Steve Fulop, told the Gothamist. “It’s just a matter of time before somebody else gets hurt.”

The Eastern Region Helicopter Council, an air tourism industry group, told the AP that New York City’s sightseeing tours “already operate under the most stringent of regulations”.

Thursday’s helicopter crash was one of two recent deadly mishaps involving small aircraft in New York. On Saturday, all six people aboard a twin-engine Mitsubishi MU-2B that crashed near the upstate community of Copake were killed.

The former college soccer star Karenna Groff – who was named the NCAA’s woman of the year in 2022 – was identified as one of the victims of that crash. Others included her father, Dr Michael Groff; her mother, Dr Joy Saini; and her boyfriend, James Santoro. Santoro’s father, John Santoro, identified him, Groff and her parents to the Associated Press.

Investigators as of Monday had not determined what caused the crash.

NTSB officials have said air traffic controllers at New York’s Columbia county airport said the pilot reported a missed initial approach. The air traffic controllers then tried to alert the pilot to a low-altitude warning but could not reach him, officials said.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/14/new-york-helicopter-tour-crash-shuts-down,1
Trump to meet El Salvador’s president at White House amid backlash over deportations – US politics live,"From 5h ago 12.03 CEST Trump to meet El Salvador president at White House amid backlash over deportations Donald Trump is due to meet El Salvador president Nayib Bukele at the White House on Monday with the small Central American country having become a focus of the US administration’s mass deportation operation. Since March, El Salvador has accepted from the US more than 200 Venezuelan immigrants – whom Trump administration officials have accused of gang activity and violent crimes – and placed them inside the country’s notorious maximum-security gang prison just outside the capital, San Salvador, called Cecot, an acronym for Terrorism Confinement Centre in Spanish. That has made Bukele, the most powerful leader in El Salvador’s modern history, a vital ally for the Trump administration, which has offered little evidence for its claims that the Venezuelan immigrants were gang members, nor has it released names of those deported. Bukele won a decisive victory in elections last year after voters cast aside concerns about erosion of democracy to reward him for a fierce gang crackdown that transformed security in El Salvador. The alliance between Trump and Bukele “has become an example for security and prosperity in our hemisphere”, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said yesterday. Trump told reporters he thought Bukele was doing a “fantastic job” and “taking care of a lot of problems that we have that we really wouldn’t be able to take care of from a cost standpoint”. Donald Trump meets with Nayib Bukele in New York during the UN general assembly in 2019. Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP US officials said in court filings on Sunday that they were not obliged to help a Maryland resident get out of prison in El Salvador after he was erroneously deported, despite a supreme court ruling directing the government to “facilitate” his return to the US. Attorneys for the Trump administration said the high court’s order to “facilitate” the return of Kilmar Abrego García, 29, meant they should “remove any domestic obstacles that would otherwise impede the alien’s ability to return here”, not help extract him from El Salvador. The Trump administration has acknowledged that García, a Salvadoran migrant who was living in Maryland and has had a work permit since 2019, was deported in March in violation of an immigration judge’s order blocking his removal to El Salvador. The White House has admitted that Garcia was deported due to an “administrative error”. He was one of the 238 Venezuelans and 23 Salvadorans the Trump administration has deported to Cecot – which houses both convicted criminals and those still going through El Salvador’s court system – under an agreement between the two countries. The case highlights the administration’s tensions with federal courts. Several have blocked Trump policies, and judges have expressed frustration with administration efforts – or lack of them – to comply with court orders. Kilmar Abrego García has had a US work permit since 2019 but was stopped and detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers on 12 March.

40m ago 16.06 CEST The most pressing question facing the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, when he meets with Donald Trump later this morning, is will he return a Venezuelan man whom even the Trump administration admits was sent to El Salvador by mistake? Per Politico, Kilmar Abrego Garcia was under specific court order not to be deported to El Salvador due to the risk of persecution, but got swept up in the Trump administration’s rush to deport alleged gang members. (CBS News reviewed the 238 cases last month and found precious few have criminal records. None of these men were given due process.) The supreme court last week confirmed lower court decisions and ruled that the administration must “facilitate” Garcia’s return to the United States. After which precisely nothing has happened. In a court filing published late last night, Politico reports that the Trump administration insisted Garcia’s lawyers have over-interpreted the Scotus ruling, and that to “facilitate” his return means simply allowing it to happen from a domestic point of view. The Trump administration is also claiming the US supreme court has no jurisdiction over what El Salvador does with prisoners, nor over how Trump should act with regard to foreign relations. Which means that in the White House’s view, it’s entirely up to Maga-aligned Bukele whether to send the prisoner back. Share Updated at 16.10 CEST

2h ago 15.11 CEST Zelenskyy invites Trump to Ukraine to see damage from Russia’s invasion Luke Harding Volodymyr Zelenskyy has invited Donald Trump to visit Ukraine to see the devastation caused by Russia’s invasion, while the US president appeared to play down Moscow’s latest deadly attack, the worst on civilians this year, calling it “a mistake”. International leaders condemned Russia’s strike on the centre of the Ukrainian city of Sumy on Sunday, which killed 34 people, including two children, and injured more than 100. Two ballistic missiles hit as people made their way to church for Palm Sunday. Asked about Russia’s attack on civilians, Trump appeared to claim it was accidental and said he was trying to get the war stopped: “I think it was terrible and I was told they made a mistake, but I think it’s a horrible thing. I think the whole war is a horrible thing.” Trump also implied his predecessor Joe Biden was at fault for the war that began with Vladimir Putin’s invasion. “This war would never have started if I were president. That war is a shame,” he said. In an interview with the CBS show 60 Minutes, recorded before the attack on Sumy, Zelenskyy urged Trump to see the damage from Russia’s invasion for himself. “Please, before any kind of decisions, any kind of forms of negotiations, come to see people, civilians, warriors, hospitals, churches, children destroyed or dead,” he said. The Ukrainian president pushed back on a suggestion made by the US vice-president, JD Vance, that Ukraine laid on “propaganda tours” for foreign leaders. “We will not prepare anything. It will not be theatre. You can go exactly where you want, in any city which [has] been under attacks,” Zelenskyy said. He expressed frustration that senior White House figures continue to repeat Kremlin talking points. Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff – who met Putin on Friday in St Petersburg – recently said four Ukrainian regions had “voted” to join Russia, a reference to fake referendums in occupied territory. “I believe that Russian narratives prevail in the United States. It seems to me that the vice-president is justifying Putin’s actions. This is a change in reality. The Russians are the aggressors, and we are the victims,” Zelenskyy said.

2h ago 15.05 CEST ‘The sky won’t fall’: China plays down Trump tariff risks as stock markets rally Jasper Jolly China has played down the risk of damage to its exports from Donald Trump’s tariffs, with an official saying the “the sky won’t fall”, as stock markets rose on Monday amid signs of a retreat on electronics restrictions. The world’s second-largest economy has diversified its trade away from the US in recent years, according to Lyu Daliang, a customs administration spokesperson, in comments reported by state-owned agency Xinhua. China has retaliated forcefully to Washington’s tariffs, with 125% levies on US imports against the US’s total of 145% border taxes on goods moving the other way. The trade war has prompted turmoil on financial markets since Trump first revealed tariffs on every country in the world on 2 April. Since then he has partly retreated on the highest levies on most trading partners for at least 90 days, but has doubled down in his spat with China. The White House offered further relief over the weekend with an exemption from the steepest tariffs for electronics including smartphones, laptops and semiconductors. Trump officials later appeared to walk that back with the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, saying such devices would be “included in the semiconductor tariffs which are coming in probably a month or two”. Trump said on Sunday night on his social network, Truth Social, that “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’,” highlighting that smartphones are still subject to 20% levies and suggesting they could still rise higher. However, investors on Monday appeared unconvinced by Trump’s attempts to play down the retreat. Japan’s Nikkei gained 1.2% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose by 2.2% and the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges climbed by 0.8% and 1.2%, respectively. European stock market indices also jumped in opening trades, with London’s FTSE 100 up by 1.6%, Germany’s Dax up 2.2%, and France’s Cac 40 up 2%. “The sky won’t fall” for Chinese exports,” China’s Lyu said. “These efforts have not only supported our partners’ development but also enhanced our own resilience.” ‘The sky won’t fall’: China plays down Trump tariff risks as stock markets rally Read more Share Updated at 15.23 CEST

2h ago 14.39 CEST Rome to host second round of US-Iran nuclear talks - reports A second round of nuclear talks between the US and Iran will be held in Rome, Italian foreign minister Antonio Tajani was reported as saying on Monday by the country’s main news agency Ansa. Iran and the US said they held “positive” and “constructive” talks in Oman on Saturday and agreed to reconvene this week. “We received a request from the interested parties and from Oman, which is playing the role of mediator, and we have given a positive response,” Tajani was quoted by Ansa as saying at the world Expo in Osaka, Japan. Rome has often hosted these type of talks, Tajani said, and is “prepared to do everything it takes to support all negotiations that can lead to a resolution of the nuclear issue, and to building peace”. Earlier, citing two unnamed sources with knowledge of the matter, Axios reported that the second round of the US-Iranian talks would be held in Rome on Saturday. Donald Trump, who has threatened military action if no deal is reached on halting Iran’s nuclear program, told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday that he met with advisers on Iran and expected a quick decision. He gave no further details. The previous day he had told reporters that the Iran situation was “going pretty good, I think”. Share Updated at 14.49 CEST

3h ago 14.14 CEST Donald Trump will meet this morning with El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, at 11am ET at the White House. Referring to the cost of imprisoning the detainees in El Salvador, Trump told reporters on Sunday about Bukele: I think he’s doing a fantastic job, and he’s taking care of a lot of problems that we have that we really wouldn’t be able to take care of from a cost standpoint. He’s been amazing. We have some very bad people in that prison. People that should have never have been allowed into our country. People that murdered, drug dealers, some of the worst people on earth are in that prison. And he’s able to do that. Pressed on whether he had concerns about alleged human rights abuses at the mega-prison, Trump said no. I don’t see it. I don’t see that,” he said. The US on Saturday deported 10 more people it alleges are gang members to El Salvador, said secretary of state Marco Rubio, who called the alliance between Trump and Bukele “an example for security and prosperity in our hemisphere”. Lawyers and relatives of the people held in El Salvador say they are not gang members and had no opportunity to contest the US government assertion that they were. The Trump administration says it vetted migrants to ensure they belonged to Tren de Aragua, which it labels a terrorist organization. Share Updated at 14.16 CEST

3h ago 13.52 CEST After the Trump administration erroneously deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Salvadoran immigrant who was living in Maryland and has had a work permit since 2019, to El Salvador, the White House claimed he was involved in human trafficking. But the allegation has not appeared in court records related to his deportation. As we mentioned in a previous post, Abrego Garcia was deported alongside 238 Venezuelan men alleged to be members of the Tren de Aragua gang who are now held in Cecot, a high-security Salvadoran prison known for its brutal conditions. A US immigration official conceded in court filings that many of the deportees had no criminal record but maintained they were still dangerous. It adds weight to a charge that Trump and his officials have been ignoring court orders and violating legal norms in his push to remove non-citizens or people whose beliefs are viewed by the White House as counter to US foreign policy interests. A case in point is that of Mahmoud Khalil, the Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate, who was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers in New York on 8 March and transferred to a detention facility in Jena, Louisiana, where he has been detained for over a month. As my colleague Oliver Laughland notes in this article, an immigration judge ruled on Friday that, despite being a legal US resident, Khalil, who participated in pro-Palestinian protests, is eligible to be deported from the US. Khalil isn’t accused of breaking any laws during the protests at Columbia. The government has said noncitizens who participate in such demonstrations should be expelled from the country for expressing views that the administration considers to be antisemitic and “pro-Hamas”. Khalil’s lawyers have challenged the legality of his detention, saying the Trump administration is trying to deport him for an activity that is protected by the first amendment.

Photograph: Jeenah Moon/Reuters Immigration judge Jamee E Comans ruled on Friday the government’s argument that Khalil’s presence in the US posed “potentially serious foreign policy consequences” was enough to satisfy requirements for his deportation. Comans said the government had “established by clear and convincing evidence that he is removable”. Khalil’s lawyers plan to appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals, and can also pursue an asylum case on his behalf if they choose to. The 31-year-old’s legal team is asking for Khalil to be released on bail so that he can reunite with his wife, who is due to give birth to their first child this month. Even though the judge found Khalil, who was born in a Palestinian refugee camp in Syria and holds Algerian citizenship, removable on foreign policy grounds, nothing will happen quickly in the immigration proceeding, his attorney, Marc Van Der Hout, said. “Today, we saw our worst fears play out: Mahmoud was subject to a charade of due process, a flagrant violation of his right to a fair hearing, and a weaponization of immigration law to suppress dissent,” Van Der Hout said in a statement. The judge gave lawyers for Khalil until 23 April to seek a waiver. Share Updated at 14.53 CEST

5h ago 12.15 CEST As we reported in the previous post, the US has sent hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador to be held without trial in a controversial mega-prison known for its harsh conditions. The Cecot prison has drawn ire from human rights organisations and has become central to the promise of the Salvadorian president, Nayib Bukele, to rid his country of crime. What is the Cecot prison? In February 2023, El Salvador opened what it claims is Latin America’s biggest prison with capacity for 40,000 inmates. The 23-hectare prison is isolated in a rural region 70 km east of capital San Salvador. Bukele in November said the prison cost $115m to develop and equip. The president declared a state of emergency in March 2022 that remains in effect and has entailed the arrest of more than 84,000 people. This includes alleged members of El Salvador’s Mara Salvatrucha gang, also known as MS-13, and its rival, Barrio 18. Government reports put the prison population at 14,500 inmates in August 2024, but a government spokesperson said in March 2025 that the statistic was outdated. A current figure was not disclosed security reasons, the spokesperson said.

Argentine security minister Patricia Bullrich praised the facility in a June 2024 social media post that said: “This is the way. Tough on criminals.” A US Republican party delegation from the House of Representatives, led by then representative Matt Gaetz, visited the prison a month later. YouTube personalities have had millions of views for their prison visit videos that highlighted harsh conditions in the prison. Many human rights organisations have criticised El Salvador’s prisons and especially Cecot. Groups have reported alleged human rights violations like torture, inmate deaths and mass trials. Bukele said in August that “gang members will spend their entire lives in prison”. Justice minister Gustavo Villatoro vowed in 2023 that officials “will make sure none of those who enter the Cecot ever leave on foot”. Share Updated at 15.30 CEST

Speaking to NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday, the 75-year-old hedge fund manager said: “I think that right now we are at a decision-making point and very close to a recession. And I’m worried about something worse than a recession if this isn’t handled well.” He went on to add: “A recession is two negative quarters of GDP and whether it goes slightly there. We always have those things. We have something that’s much more profound. We have a breaking down of the monetary order. We are going to change the monetary order because we cannot spend the amounts of money.” View image in fullscreen Ray Dalio said he is “worried about something worse than a recession” if Donald Trump does not properly handle tariffs. Photograph: Ng Han Guan/AP Dalio’s comments come in response to a tumultuous week across the global stock markets following the US president’s tariffs policies that include a 145% tariff raise on China. The billionaire also said there are “profound changes in our domestic order … and world order”, comparing current times with the 1930s. “I’ve studied history and this repeats over and over again. So if you take tariffs, if you take debt, if you take the rising power challenging existing power, if you take those factors and look at the factors, those changes in the orders, the systems, are very, very disruptive. How that’s handled could produce something that is much worse than a recession. Or it could be handled well,” he said. Dalio, who correctly predicted the 2008 recession, also said the current economic state of the US is “at a juncture”. “Let’s take the budget. If the budget deficit can be reduced to 3% of GDP, it will be about 7% if things are not changed. If it could be reduced to about 3% of GDP, and these trade deficits and so on are managed in the right way, this could all be managed very well,” he said. He went on to urge congressional members to take what he calls the “3% pledge”, adding that if they don’t, there will be a supply and demand problem for debt with results that will be “worse than a normal recession”.

6h ago 10.48 CEST Chinese president in Vietnam to bolster regional economic ties Chin’s president, Xi Jinping will be welcomed by Vietnam’s president, Luong Cuong, today as he seeks to strengthen economic ties in south-east Asia amid a trade war with Washington that has caused turmoil in global markets. In an article for the Nhan Dan newspaper, Xi called for more regional cooperation, saying China and Vietnam were “friendly socialist neighbours sharing the same ideals and extensive strategic interests”. He added that a “trade war and tariff war will produce no winner, and protectionism will lead nowhere”, without explicitly mentioning the US. The visit, planned for weeks, comes as Beijing faces 145% US duties, while Vietnam is negotiating a reduction of threatened US tariffs of 46%. China is Vietnam’s biggest trading partner; Hanoi has a good relationship with both Washington and Beijing. View image in fullscreen Xi Jinping in Hanoi on a charm offensive. Photograph: Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters As my colleague Rebecca Ratcliffe notes in this story, officials in Hanoi were shocked when Vietnam was hit with the 46% tariff, even after various efforts to appease the Trump administration. The tariff, which has been paused, threatens to devastate the country’s ambitious economic growth plan. Xi will visit Vietnam, a manufacturing powerhouse, from 14 to 15 April, and Malaysia and Cambodia from 15 to 18 April. He last visited Cambodia and Malaysia nine and 12 years ago, respectively. Xi’s trip to Hanoi, his second in less than 18 months, aims to consolidate relations with a strategic neighbour that has received billions of dollars of Chinese investments in recent years as China-based manufacturers moved south to avoid tariffs imposed by the first Trump administration.

First Thing: Deep confusion as Trump signals new tariffs on smartphones and computers,"Good morning.

Donald Trump’s tariff war has plunged deeper into chaos after a cabinet official floated a plan for new levies on semiconductors – a crucial component in electronic goods – just days after the Trump administration exempted computers and smartphones from tariffs.

Trump’s commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, told NBC the tariff exemption on several electronic devices was temporary, and that new duties would come in “a month or two”. Semiconductors would be targeted, he said.

The president said he would lay out the new tariffs on Monday and that any relief for the electronics industry would be short-lived. “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform, adding: “Especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!”

How is the continuing tariff whiplash being received? The billionaire investor Ray Dalio said he was worried the US would experience “something worse than a recession” as a result of Trump’s trade policies.

EU foreign ministers meet after deadly Palm Sunday attack by Russians on Ukraine

EU foreign ministers are meeting in Luxembourg this morning to discuss the key challenges facing the bloc in foreign affairs, with Ukraine top of the pile.

Reeling from the shock of Russia’s attack on Palm Sunday on Sumy, in north-eastern Ukraine, which killed at least 34 and injured more than 100, the ministers will discuss what more they can do to help Kyiv deter Russian aggression.

There were strong political reactions already on Sunday. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, blamed Moscow for “blatant disregard for human lives, international law, and the diplomatic efforts of president Trump”.

Speaking to reporters last night, Trump said the attack on Sumy was “terrible” but added he was “told it was a mistake”. He then blamed Joe Biden for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, adding: “This is not my war.”

What has the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said? He issued a dramatic plea to Trump telling him: “Before any kind of decisions, any kind of forms of negotiations, come to see people, civilians, warriors, hospitals, churches, children destroyed or dead.”

High levels of toxic chemicals found in paper receipts used by US retailers

Paper receipts from major retailers in the US are so laden with bisphenol S that holding one for 10 seconds can cause the skin to absorb enough of the highly toxic chemical to violate California’s safety threshold, research has found.

The findings are being used as evidence in legal action aimed at pressuring retailers to stop using receipt paper treated with bisphenol S, or BPS, which is linked to cancer and reproductive problems.

The Center for Environmental Health (CEH) non-profit has sent violation notices to about 50 major retailers alerting them to the exceedance of California’s Proposition 65 limits for BPS.

Which companies have received notices? Among the companies to which notices were sent for the allegedly illegal levels of BPS in their receipts are Burger King, Chanel, Dollar General, AMC Theaters, GameStop, Subway, Foot Locker and Ace Hardware.

In the space of just five weeks, China has held live-fire drills on the doorsteps of Australia, Taiwan and Vietnam, writes Angela Dewan. It tested new landing barges on ships that could facilitate an amphibious assault on Taiwan. And it unveiled deep-sea cable cutters with the ability to switch off another country’s internet access – a tool no other nation admits to having. China has been flexing its maritime muscle in the Indo-Pacific to send a message of supremacy to its regional neighbours, experts say. But it’s also testing the thinking of a bigger rival farther afield: Donald Trump.

"Pennsylvania arson suspect planned to beat governor with hammer, documents say","A man who authorities said scaled an iron security fence in the middle of the night, eluded police and broke into the Pennsylvania governor’s mansion – where he set a fire – had planned to beat the governor, Josh Shapiro, with a hammer if he found him because he hates the politician, according to court documents released on Monday.

The fire left significant damage and forced Shapiro, his family and guests to evacuate the building early on Sunday. The man, arrested later in the day, faces charges including attempted homicide, terrorism, aggravated arson and aggravated assault, authorities said.

During a police interview, authorities said Cody Balmer told them after he was taken into custody that he would have beaten Shapiro with a small sledgehammer if he had found him, the documents allege. Balmer had walked an hour from his home to the governor’s residence in Harrisburg, and during the police interview, “Balmer admitted to harboring hatred towards … Shapiro,” according to a police affidavit. The affidavit did not note why Balmer purportedly hated Shapiro.

Shapiro said he, his wife, their four children, two dogs and another family had celebrated the Jewish holiday of Passover at the residence on Saturday and were awakened by state troopers pounding on their doors at about 2am Sunday. They fled, and firefighters extinguished the fire, officials said. No one was injured.

At a Sunday evening news conference in front of the badly damaged south wing of the governor’s residence, Col Christopher Paris of Pennsylvania state police colonel identified the man in custody as Balmer, 38, of Harrisburg.

Authorities did not say whether Balmer has a lawyer or where he was being held. And calls to people believed to be relatives went unanswered or unreturned on Sunday. One recent listed residence in Harrisburg was condemned in 2022.

Paris emphasized that the investigation was continuing. Authorities did not disclose the precise motive for the alleged arsonist.

An emotional Shapiro, who is viewed as a potential White House contender for the Democratic party in 2028, said he was unbowed.

Shapiro said that if Balmer was trying to stop him from doing his job, then he would work harder. And he added that Balmer would not stop him from observing his faith.

“When we were in the state dining room last night, we told the story of Passover” and the exodus of the Jews from slavery in Egypt to freedom, Shapiro said. “I refuse to be trapped by the bondage that someone attempts to put on me by attacking us as they did here last night. I refuse to let anyone who had evil intentions like that stop me from doing the work that I love.”

Authorities said the suspect hopped over a nearly 7ft-high (2.1-meter-high) iron security fence surrounding the property, eluded officers who became aware of the breach and forcibly entered the residence before setting it on fire. He used beer bottles filled with gasoline to make the molotov cocktails, documents say.

The state police lieutenant colonel, George Bivens, said Balmer appeared to have carefully planned the attack. He was inside the residence for about a minute before he escaped, Bivens said.

Bivens said Balmer was later arrested in the area.

Balmer has faced criminal charges over the past decade including simple assault, theft and forgery, according to online criminal court records.

Shapiro said the fire was set in the very room where he and his family celebrated Passover with a seder with members of Harrisburg’s Jewish community on Saturday night.

After reiterating that authorities had not determined this “person’s specific motive”, Shapiro told the news briefing: “We do know a few truths. First: this type of violence is not OK. This kind of violence is becoming far too common in our society. And I don’t give a damn if it’s coming from one particular side or the other, directed at one particular party or another or one particular person or another. It is not OK, and it has to stop. We have to be better than this.”

The fire badly damaged the inside of the large room that is often used for entertaining crowds and art displays. Large west- and south-facing windows were completely missing their glass panes, shattered glass littered the pathways and doors stood ajar amid signs of charring. Window panes and brick around doors and windows were blackened and charred.

Inside, a charred piano, tables, walls, metal buffet serving dishes and more could be seen through broken windows and fire-blackened doors.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/14/suspect-arson-pennsylvania-governor,1
Georgetown alumni and students call for release of scholar detained by immigration authorities,"More than 370 alumni of Georgetown University joined 65 current students there in signing on to a letter opposing immigration authorities’ detention of Dr Badar Khan Suri, a senior postdoctoral fellow at the institution’s Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding (ACMCU).

The letter, dated Sunday and shared with the Guardian, follows the Trump administration’s detention of Khan Suri – a citizen of India – on 17 March. He is being held at an immigration prison in Alvarado, Texas, where his next hearing is scheduled for 6 May.

Immigration officials revoked his J-1 student visa, alleging his father-in-law was an adviser to Hamas officials more than a decade ago – and claiming he was “deportable” because of his posts on social media in support of Palestine.

Khan Suri’s wife, who is of Palestinian descent, is a US citizen.

Citing the ideals of the Catholic religious order that founded Georgetown University in Washington DC, Sunday’s letter said Khan Suri’s “persecution represents a fundamental violation of academic freedom, due process, and the Jesuit values that define” the institution.

“We see his detention clearly for what it is: an attempt to instill fear, silence critical thought, and erode solidarity among students and scholars of varying backgrounds and identities,” the letter added. “We reject this attempt and demand his immediate release.”

The letter notes immigration authorities arrested Khan Suri at his home in Virginia, and it contends that the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has provided no evidence to support its claims.

A senior Georgetown official, meanwhile, said the university was not provided an explanation for Khan Suri’s detention.

“We are not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity, and we have not received a reason for his detention,” said Joel Hellman, the dean of Georgetown’s school of foreign service, in a statement.

Sunday’s letter compares Khan Suri’s detention to those of other academic scholars around the US under Donald Trump’s second presidency, including Mahmoud Khalil, Ranjani Srinivasan, and Leqaa Kordia of Columbia University – as well as Rasha Alawieh of Brown University.

The letter also calls for Georgetown University to take a firm and public stance in support of academic freedom and to invite members of the university community to discuss a collective response. It additionally calls for academic institutions, alumni, students and faculty nationwide to unite in rejecting these attacks.

The letter was issued three days after 130 Jewish faculty, staff, students, and alumni of Georgetown signed on to a letter in support of Khan Suri. The signers of that missive said Trump is weaponizing Jewish identity, faith, and antisemitism to justify arrests and deportations that have become staples of his return to the White House in January after his first term as president.

“While we may hold varying opinions and perspectives on Israel-Palestine, we all agree that the growing wave of politically motivated campus deportation efforts is an authoritarian move that harms the entire campus community,” the earlier letter stated. “We encourage Jews and everyone – at Georgetown and beyond – to take action and speak out.”

The DHS and the White House have dismissed that letter and criticisms of the arrests.

A DHS spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, told NPR that the letter from Jewish members of Georgetown was “pretty absurd mental gymnastics”.

“To believe that revoking visas of individuals who glorify and support terrorists, harass Jews and do the bidding of organizations that relish the killing of Americans and Jews is in fact making Jewish students less safe,” McLaughlin argued.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/14/georgetown-professor-detained,1

Donald Trump will take America through yet another grave and unprecedented national drama this week when he becomes the first ex-president to appear in court charged with a crime.

The 45th president is expected to turn himself in on Tuesday in Manhattan, the stage where he built his legend as a brash popular culture figure and real estate magnate but which could now, in the case of “The People of the State of New York against Donald J. Trump,” engineer his downfall.

In what will be extraordinary scenes, Trump will return to New York after a grand jury voted to indict him last week in a case involving a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. His appearance, accompanied by Secret Service agents, will come as he fires up his 2024 campaign for the White House. Trump plans to make a make a speech when he gets back to Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday night in which he will seek to leverage political advantage out of a perilous, personal legal crisis.

For many Americans who disdain Trump and his riotous single term, the case could be a sign that, finally, he is being called to account for his rule-crushing behavior and that everyone – even former presidents – are equal under the law. But Trump, using his bond with his most loyal supporters, is claiming the prosecution is a case of naked political persecution from District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, that’s designed to thwart the possibility of a presidential comeback. According to fundraising numbers that his campaign is touting, Trump is getting a political boost from the attention.

Yet a criminal indictment takes Trump into unique political territory. And however the case turns out, his return to the spotlight in these circumstances is another twist in an exhausting saga featuring a double impeachment, false claims of a stolen election, and a mob attack on the US Congress during an unruly four-year presidency that pushed the nation to the point of exhaustion and deepened its polarization.

Some legal experts, without having seen the still-sealed indictment, have questioned whether a case that appears to revolve around infringements of accounting practices and possible campaign finance violations is sufficiently serious to merit the historical step of indicting an ex-president who is already running again.

At the same time, it is ultimately Trump’s norm-busting behavior that pushed the country to this somber moment. He’s also being investigated over efforts to overturn the 2020 election result in Georgia, and by a special counsel probing his hoarding of classified documents and conduct in the run up to January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. In several of these cases, Trump could face even more serious legal problems than in the Stormy Daniels matter, but that case is the only one so far that has yielded an indictment.

Trump has denied wrongdoing in all of the cases. But once more, America’s political and legal systems, under a near-constant stress test since he came down the escalator in Trump Tower to launch his campaign in 2015, will be put under enormous pressure that is likely to only deepen the country’s internal estrangement.",https://edition.cnn.com/webview/politics/live-news/trump-indictment-stormy-daniels-news-04-03-23/index.html,1

"April 3, 2023 - Russia-Ukraine news","A Ukrainian tank is seen near the frontline area amid the Russia-Ukraine war, in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on April 02. (Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)

The Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.

The General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.

It said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.

“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.

West of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.

Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”

“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.

Syrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”

Some of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.

“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.

He also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.

“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.

He also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”

Social media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.

Denis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.

“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said.",https://edition.cnn.com/webview/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-04-03-23/index.html,1

Chinese spy balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing,"Washington CNN —

The Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.

The balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.

Still, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.

A US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”

The US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.

As CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.

The FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.

CNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.

The balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.

A senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”

Gen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”

The surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.

Roughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.

China has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.

Still, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.

Beijing promised to ‘fight back’ over Taiwan leader Tsai’s US visit. But this time it has more to lose,"Hong Kong CNN —

An anticipated meeting between Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen and US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California this week has sparked concerns of a repeat of the pressure campaign China launched last year when then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei.

At that time, Beijing encircled the island democracy with unprecedented military drills – firing multiple missiles into its surrounding waters and sending dozens of warplanes speeding across a sensitive median line dividing the Taiwan Strait.

It also cut off contact with the United States over a number of issues from military matters to combating climate change, in retaliation for what it viewed as a violation of its sovereignty.

This time, Beijing has already threatened to “resolutely fight back” if a Tsai-McCarthy meeting goes ahead.

It also slammed Washington for allowing Tsai to stopover in the US while en route to and from official visits in Central America, warning it could lead to “serious” confrontation between the two powers.

A defiant Tsai staked out her own ground, pledging as she took off on her 10-day trip not to let “external pressure” stop Taiwan from connecting with the world and like-minded democracies.

But the optics of the meeting, taking place in California and not Taiwan, and its timing – at a particularly thorny moment in China’s foreign relations and ahead of a presidential election in Taiwan that could reset the tone of its relationship with Beijing – may see Beijing tread more carefully this time, or at least not escalate further, analysts say.

“This puts the burden on China not to overreact, because any overreaction is only going to push China further away from the world,” said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington.

That doesn’t mean, however, that Beijing won’t be closely watching Tsai’s movements as it calibrates its response – and decides how much military might to flex over her meeting with an American lawmaker on American soil.

The opacity of China’s system – and the potential for competing interests within its vast bureaucracy – also make it difficult to accurately predict its response.

“Every time Taiwan does anything that China doesn’t like, the Chinese react with their own military coercion,” Sun said. But in the current situation, “they have to consider the consequences of overreaction,” she added.

Rising pressure

The expected meeting, which McCarthy’s office announced earlier this week would take place on Wednesday, also comes at a precarious moment in US-China relations.

Washington and Beijing are struggling to stabilize their communication amid flaring tensions over issues from a downed suspected Chinese surveillance balloon to semiconductor supply chains – raising the stakes of potential damage to that relationship if Beijing lashes out as it did when Tsai met Pelosi.

Taiwan is still feeling the fallout of that response last August, with Chinese military forces now regularly making incursions over what had previously been an informal but largely respected border of control between Beijing and Taipei in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan’s official Central News Agency also reported Monday that Tsai would meet with McCarthy, citing Tsai’s presidential office.

But a meeting between Tsai and the leader of the Republican majority in the US House of Representatives, who ranks second in line to the Presidency, would mark another symbolic moment for Taiwan and the US, which only maintain unofficial ties.

For Tsai, who is entering the final year of her two-term presidency, “it’s clearly a capstone event,” according to Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University’s Taiwan Studies Program. “She has this image as the Taiwanese president who has taken US-Taiwan relations to new heights, and who … has been able to give Taiwan almost unprecedented international visibility,” he said.

That increased visibility – and enhanced cooperation with the US – has followed China’s mounting pressure on the island, which sits fewer than 110 miles (177 kilometers) from the mainland coast.

China’s Communist Party claims the self-governing island democracy as its own despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary.

The party has undertaken a sweeping expansion of its military capabilities over the past decade under leader Xi Jinping – and ramped up its pervasive economic, diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan.

That’s driven concerns, among some in Washington, that Beijing is preparing for an invasion, though China’s official language still suggests that scenario is not its preferred option for achieving the claimed goal of “reunification.”

It is those pressures – and how to support Taiwan against unilateral actions by Beijing – that are likely to be on the table when Tsai, McCarthy and a bipartisan group of US lawmakers sit down on Wednesday.

Congress has been a pillar of increasing American support for Taiwan in recent years. Lawmakers regularly visit the island and drive bipartisan legislation enhancing support and cooperation.

While the US switched its diplomatic relations to Beijing decades ago, it maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and is bound by law to provide the democratic island with the means to defend itself.

Under Washington’s longstanding “One China” policy, the US acknowledges China’s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never officially recognized Beijing’s claim to the island of 23 million.

Though McCarthy does not have Pelosi’s decades-long record of advocacy regarding China, the California Republican is now a leading voice pushing for closer scrutiny of Beijing, and meeting Tsai could help him to burnish that image.

Last month, McCarthy told reporters that meeting Tsai in the US would not impact whether he travels to Taiwan in the future – something he had earlier said he wanted to do.

Beijing watching

A meeting in California, on US soil, is widely seen as less likely to provoke Beijing than a McCarthy visit to Taiwan.

Pelosi’s trip – the first from a lawmaker of that rank to the island in 25 years – generated a fever pitch of nationalist and anti-US rhetoric in mainland China.

This time, so far, domestic conversation in China’s heavily controlled media sphere has been significantly muted.

But the stakes remain high – including for Beijing itself – over how it responds, analysts say.

As Taiwan prepares for a presidential election in January, a fierce response could push voters away from Taiwan’s main opposition party Kuomintang (KMT), widely seen as more friendly toward Beijing.

It could also jar with another high profile trip happening now: a tour of mainland China from former Taiwan president and senior KMT member Ma Ying-jeou, the first visit from a current or former Taiwan leader since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949.

Ma’s tour is a “once in a half a century opportunity to send a conciliatory message between the two sides, Beijing shouldn’t want to tank that,” said Sung, the political scientist.

China is also acutely aware that its actions toward Taiwan are under a significantly brighter global spotlight following the invasion of Ukraine by Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close diplomatic partner of Xi. Putin’s rhetoric over Ukraine has echoes of how Xi speaks of Taiwan.

Beijing has recently sought to position itself as an agent of peace in that conflict – especially as it aims to repair frayed ties with Europe.

This week, as Tsai is expected to meet with McCarthy, French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will head to China – an important opportunity that Xi may not want to overshadow with military posturing.

An aggressive response also risks stoking confrontation with the US, not yet six months after Xi and US President Joe Biden called to enhance communication during a face-to-face meeting in Bali.

“(A less overtly aggressive response) would imply that Beijing does not wish to escalate tension with the US to a level that can risk getting out of hand,” said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.

“A reset in US-China ties is not on the agenda, but an easing of tension is not beyond the realm of possibility.”",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/04/asia/tsai-ing-wen-taiwan-mccarthy-meeting-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html,1

Artemis II: The 4 astronauts NASA picked for moon mission,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

Astronauts who will helm the first crewed moon mission in five decades were revealed on Monday, queuing up the quartet to begin training for the historic Artemis II lunar flyby that is set to take off in November 2024.

The astronauts are NASA’s Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch, and Jeremy Hansen of the Canadian Space Agency.

Wiseman is a 47-year-old decorated naval aviator and test pilot who was first selected to be a NASA astronaut in 2009. A native of Baltimore, Maryland, he’s completed one prior spaceflight, a 165-day trip to the International Space Station that had launched aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket in 2014. Most recently, Wiseman served as chief of the astronaut office before stepping down in November 2022, making him eligible for a flight assignment.

Wiseman will serve as commander of the Artemis II mission.

Hansen, 47, is a fighter pilot who was selected by the Canadian Space Agency for astronaut training in 2009. From London, Ontario, Hansen is one of only four active Canadian astronauts, and he recently became the first Canadian to be put in charge of training for a new class of NASA astronauts.

He will be the first Canadian ever to travel to deep space.

Glover is a 46-year-old naval aviator who returned to Earth from his first spaceflight in 2021 after piloting the second crewed flight of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft and spending nearly six months aboard the International Space Station.

“It’s so much more than the four names that have been announced,” Glover said during the Monday announcement at NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston. “We need to celebrate this moment in human history. … It is the next step in the journey that will get humanity to Mars.”

Glover, born in Pomona, California, served in several military squadrons in the United States and Japan in the 2000s, and he completed test pilot training with the US Air Force. When he was selected for the NASA astronaut corps in 2013, he was working in the US Senate as a legislative fellow. All told, Glover logged 3,000 flight hours in more than 40 aircraft, over 400 carrier arrested landings and 24 combat missions.

Glover’s first mission to space was as part of the SpaceX Crew-1 team, which launched to the International Space Station in November 2020 for a six-month stay on the orbiting laboratory.

Koch, 44, is a veteran of six spacewalks — including the first all-female spacewalk in 2019. She holds the record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman, with a total of 328 days in space. Koch is also an an electrical engineer who helped develop scientific instruments for multiple NASA mission. Koch, a native of Grand Rapids, Michigan, also spent a year at the South Pole, an arduous stay that could well prepare her for the intensity of a moon mission.

About this mission

The Artemis II mission will build on Artemis I, an uncrewed test mission that sent NASA’s Orion capsule on a 1.4 million-mile voyage to lap the moon that concluded in December. The space agency deemed that mission a success and is still working to review all the data collected.

If all goes to plan, Artemis II will take off around November 2024. The crew members, strapped inside the Orion spacecraft, will launch atop a NASA-developed Space Launch System rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

The journey is expected to last about 10 days and will send the crew out beyond the moon, potentially further than any human has traveled in history, though the exact distance is yet to be determined.

The “exact distance beyond the Moon will depend on the day of liftoff and the relative distance of the Moon from the Earth at the time of the mission,” NASA spokesperson Kathryn Hambleton said via email.

After circling the moon, the spacecraft will return to Earth for a splashdown landing in the Pacific Ocean.

Artemis II is expected to pave the way for the Artemis III mission later this decade, which NASA has vowed will put the first woman and person of color on the lunar surface. It will also mark the first time humans have touched down on the moon since the Apollo program ended in 1972.

The Artemis III mission is expected to take off later this decade. But much of the technology the mission will require, including spacesuits for walking on the moon and a lunar lander to ferry the astronauts to the moon’s surface, is still in development.

NASA is targeting a 2025 launch date for Artemis III, though the space agency’s inspector general has already said delays will likely push the mission to 2026 or later.

The space agency has been seeking to return people to the moon for more than a decade. The Artemis program was designed to pave the way to establishing a permanent lunar outpost, allowing astronauts to live and work deeper into space long term as NASA and its partners map a path to sending the first humans to Mars.

Picking the astronauts

Vanessa Wyche, the director of NASA’s Johnson Space Center, declined to provide details to CNN about the selection process. But she emphasized the diversity of the Artemis II crew, which includes men and women rather than only a staff of White male test pilots as has been the case for historic missions of the past.

“I can tell you, they still all have the right stuff,” Wyche said. “We have requirements different than we did (when we) just had test pilots” on inaugural missions.

Koch said in an interview with CNN’s Ed Lavandera that the group found out they were selected a few weeks ago.

“We were all sent to a meeting that was on our calendars under a different pretext that didn’t sound as lofty as the one it was going to be,” Koch said. “And accidentally two of us were very late to that meeting.”

She said the offer rendered her “speechless.”

“It truly is an honor,” she added. “It’s an honor — not to get myself in the space — but because it’s amazing to be a part of this team that’s going back to the moon and on to Mars.”

An interview with the four astronauts will air on “CNN This Morning” on Tuesday, which starts at 6 am ET.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/world/artemis-2-astronaut-crew-scn/index.html,1
Marlene Schiappa: French minister under fire for appearing on front cover of Playboy magazine,"CNN —

French government minister Marlene Schiappa has come under fire from members of her own party after appearing on the front cover of Playboy magazine.

Schiappa, who has been a government minister since 2017, appeared on the cover of the magazine to accompany a 12-page interview she did on women’s and LGBT rights. Schiappa, who is the current Minister for the Social Economy and French Associations, was photographed for the cover wearing a white dress.

Schiappa has been a long-time advocate for women’s rights and was appointed as the country’s first ever Gender Equality Minister in 2017. In this role, she successfully spearheaded a new sexual harassment law which allows for on the spot fines to be issued to men who catcall, harass or follow women on the street.

Her appearance has drawn criticism from political colleagues including French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne.

Borne pulled up Schiappa over the cover, telling her it “wasn’t appropriate, especially during this period,” CNN affiliate BFMTV reported Saturday, citing a source close to the prime minister.

France is currently in the throes of a political and social crisis triggered by French President Emmanuel Macron’s move to push ahead with controversial pension reforms despite widespread public opposition.

“We are in the middle of a social crisis, there is the issue of policing, there are people between life and death, and I have the impression of being behind a smoke screen,” Sandrine Rousseau, Green Party politician and fellow women’s rights activist, told BFMTV Friday.

French politician, Jean Luc Mélenchon who came third in the 2022 presidential elections criticized both Schiappa’s appearance and the decision by French President Emmanuel Macron to give an interview to children’s magazine, Pif Gadget, this week.

“In a country where the President expresses himself in Pif and his minister in Playboy, the problem would be the opposition. France is going off the rails,” Mélenchon tweeted Saturday.

Schiappa responded to her critics in a tweet on Saturday, saying: “Defending the right of women to have control of their bodies, that’s everywhere and all the time. In France, women are free. With all due respect to the detractors and hypocrites.”

French Interior Minister, Gérald Darmanin came to Schiappa’s defense during an interview with French news channel CNews on Sunday calling her a “woman of character.”

“I wanted to say that Marlene Schiappa is a courageous female politician who has her character and who has her style which is not mine, but I respect,” he remarked.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/02/europe/french-minister-playboy-cover-intl/index.html,1

Britain’s pound is beating every other major currency this year,"London CNN —

The British pound crashed to a record low last fall as investors rebelled against budget plans by former Prime Minister Liz Truss. Now, it’s enjoying a comeback.

Sterling hit its highest level against the US dollar in 10 months on Tuesday, topping $1.25 for the first time since June 2022. The pound, which has advanced about 3.3% versus the greenback since the start of 2023, is the best-performing currency among developed economies this year.

The UK currency has been boosted by indications the country’s economy is holding up better than expected. Activity is now thought to have expanded 0.1% in the final three months of last year, up from a previous estimate of no growth at all. Gross domestic product growth in January has been estimated at 0.3% after dropping 0.5% in December.

This resilience is bolstering expectations the Bank of England will maintain aggressive interest rate hikes despite concerns about the health of the global banking sector. Rising rates can boost the domestic currency because they help attract foreign investors searching for higher returns.

Inflation in the United Kingdom also jumped to an annual rate of 10.4% in February, underscoring the need for the Bank of England to maintain its tough approach.

The pound turnaround

The pound plunged close to $1.03 in September 2022 after the Truss government unveiled plans to boost borrowing while slashing taxes, unleashing panic in financial markets that fueled fears of a recession in the United Kingdom.

The International Monetary Fund predicted in January that the UK economy would contract by 0.6% this year, while all other advanced economies would grow, if only slightly.

“There was a lot of pessimism being priced into the pound,” said Francesco Pesole, a currency strategist at ING.

But the sharp pullback in energy prices and China’s reopening have provided some relief about the economic outlook since the start of the year.

“There was a big re-rating of growth expectations around Europe, and that impacted the UK,” Pesole said.

The euro has also been lifted by these dynamics, rising 2.3% against the US dollar in 2023. The pound’s rally has been sharper in large part because its 2022 declines were more severe, according to Pesole.

Both currencies have been aided by the greenback’s sharp drop from highs reached last September as recession fears have percolated in the United States.

A lack of clarity around the Federal Reserve’s next steps has also restrained the dollar in recent weeks. Investor speculation has increased that the Fed could pause or stop rate hikes due to concerns about the economy following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank last month.

Jordan Rochester, a currency strategist at Nomura, said he thinks the pound could rise to $1.30 this year and “potentially higher.” But he still sees risks given the uncertainty surrounding the Bank of England’s plans and how rate rises will feed back through the country’s economy. And Pesole cautioned that currency fluctuations are often overdone when markets are choppy, as they are now.

“In a volatile market environment, moves are exacerbated,” he said.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/04/investing/british-pound-currency-dollar/index.html,1
Sanna Marin: Finland’s Prime Minister concedes election,"CNN —

Finland’s left-wing Prime Minister Sanna Marin conceded defeat on Sunday in the Nordic country’s parliamentary election as the opposition right-wing National Coalition Party (NCP) claimed victory in a tightly fought contest.

The pro-business NCP was expected to win 48 of the 200 seats in parliament, narrowly ahead of the nationalist Finns Party with 46 seats and Marin’s Social Democrats on 43 seats, justice ministry election data showed with all ballots counted.

“We got the biggest mandate,” NCP leader Petteri Orpo said in a speech to followers, vowing to “fix Finland” and its economy.

He will get the first chance at forming a coalition to obtain majority in parliament as Marin’s era as prime minister was expected to end.

“We have gained support, we have gained more seats (in parliament). That’s an excellent achievement, even if we did not finish first today,” the prime minister said in a speech to party members.

Marin, 37, the world’s youngest prime minister when she took office in 2019, is considered by fans around the globe as a millennial role model for progressive new leaders, but at home she has faced criticism for her partying and her government’s public spending.

While she remains very popular among many Finns, particularly young moderates, she antagonized some conservatives with lavish spending on pensions and education they see as not frugal enough.

The NCP has led in polls for almost two years although its lead had melted away in recent months. It has promised to curb spending and stop the rise of public debt, which has reached just over 70% of GDP since Marin took office in 2019.

Orpo accused Marin of eroding Finland’s economic resilience at a time when Europe’s energy crisis, driven by Russia’s war in Ukraine, has hit the country hard and the cost of living has increased.

Orpo has said he will negotiate with all groups to obtain a majority in parliament, while Marin has said her Social Democrats may govern with the NCP but will not go into government with the Finns Party.

Marin called the Finns Party “openly racist” during a debate in January – an accusation the nationalist group rejected.

The Finns Party’s main goal is to reduce what leader Riikka Purra has called “harmful” immigration from developing countries outside the European Union. It also calls for austerity policies to curb deficit spending, a stance it shares with the NCP.

Most notable of Marin’s foreign policy actions has been her push, along with President Sauli Niinisto, for the country to make a watershed policy U-turn by seeking NATO membership in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

That process is now almost complete, with Helsinki expected to join within days after all the Western defense alliance’s 30 members approved the accession.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/02/europe/sanna-marin-finland-elections-concedes-intl/index.html,1
"Pinduoduo: One of China’s most popular apps has the ability to spy on its users, say experts","CNN —

It is one of China’s most popular shopping apps, selling clothing, groceries and just about everything else under the sun to more than 750 million users a month.

But according to cybersecurity researchers, it can also bypass users’ cell phone security to monitor activities on other apps, check notifications, read private messages and change settings.

And once installed, it’s tough to remove.

While many apps collect vast troves of user data, sometimes without explicit consent, experts say e-commerce giant Pinduoduo has taken violations of privacy and data security to the next level.

In a detailed investigation, CNN spoke to half a dozen cybersecurity teams from Asia, Europe and the United States — as well as multiple former and current Pinduoduo employees — after receiving a tipoff.

Multiple experts identified the presence of malware on the Pinduoduo app that exploited vulnerabilities in Android operating systems. Company insiders said the exploits were utilized to spy on users and competitors, allegedly to boost sales.

“We haven’t seen a mainstream app like this trying to escalate their privileges to gain access to things that they’re not supposed to gain access to,” said Mikko Hyppönen, chief research officer at WithSecure, a Finnish cybersecurity firm.

“This is highly unusual, and it is pretty damning for Pinduoduo.”

This is highly unusual, and it is pretty damning for Pinduoduo. Mikko Hyppönen, cybersecurity expert

Malware, short for malicious software, refers to any software developed to steal data or interfere with computer systems and mobile devices.

Evidence of sophisticated malware in the Pinduoduo app comes amid intense scrutiny of Chinese-developed apps like TikTok over concerns about data security.

Some American lawmakers are pushing for a national ban on the popular short-video app, whose CEO Shou Chew was grilled by Congress for five hours last week about its relations with the Chinese government.

The revelations are also likely to draw more attention to Pinduoduo’s international sister app, Temu, which is topping US download charts and fast expanding in other Western markets. Both are owned by Nasdaq-listed PDD, a multinational company with roots in China.

While Temu has not been implicated, Pinduoduo’s alleged actions risk casting a shadow over its sister app’s global expansion.

There is no evidence that Pinduoduo has handed data to the Chinese government. But as Beijing enjoys significant leverage over businesses under its jurisdiction, there are concerns from US lawmakers that any company operating in China could be forced to cooperate with a broad range of security activities.

The findings follow Google’s suspension of Pinduoduo from its Play Store in March, citing malware identified in versions of the app.

An ensuing report from Bloomberg said a Russian cybersecurity firm had also identified potential malware in the app.

Pinduoduo has previously rejected “the speculation and accusation that Pinduoduo app is malicious.”

CNN has contacted PDD multiple times over email and phone for comment, but has not received a response.

Rise to success

Pinduoduo, which boasts a user base that accounts for three quarters of China’s online population and a market value three times that of eBay (EBAY), wasn’t always an online shopping behemoth.

Founded in 2015 in Shanghai by Colin Huang, a former Google employee, the startup was fighting to establish itself in a market long dominated by e-commerce stalwarts Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD).

It succeeded by offering steep discounts on friends-and-family group buying orders and focusing on lower-income rural areas.

Pinduoduo posted triple digit growth in monthly users until the end of 2018, the year it listed in New York. By the middle of 2020, though, the increase in monthly users had slowed to around 50% and would continue to decline, according to its earnings reports.

It was in 2020, according to a current Pinduoduo employee, that the company set up a team of about 100 engineers and product managers to dig for vulnerabilities in Android phones, develop ways to exploit them — and turn that into profit.

According to the source, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisals, the company only targeted users in rural areas and smaller towns initially, while avoiding users in megacities such as Beijing and Shanghai.

“The goal was to reduce the risk of being exposed,” they said.

By collecting expansive data on user activities, the company was able to create a comprehensive portrait of users’ habits, interests and preferences, according to the source.

This allowed it to improve its machine learning model to offer more personalized push notifications and ads, attracting users to open the app and place orders, they said.

The team was disbanded in early March, the source added, after questions about their activities came to light.

PDD didn’t reply to CNN’s repeated requests for comment on the team.

What experts found

Approached by CNN, researchers from Tel Aviv-based cyber firm Check Point Research, Delaware-based app security startup Oversecured and Hyppönen’s WithSecure conducted independent analysis of the 6.49.0 version of the app, released on Chinese app stores in late February.

Google Play is not available in China, and Android users in the country download their apps from local stores. In March, when Google suspended Pinduoduo, it said it had found malware in off-Play versions of the app.

The researchers found code designed to achieve “privilege escalation”: a type of cyberattack that exploits a vulnerable operating system to gain a higher level of access to data than it’s supposed to have, according to experts.

“Our team has reverse engineered that code and we can confirm that it tries to escalate rights, tries to gain access to things normal apps wouldn’t be able to do on Android phones,” said Hyppönen.

The app was able to continue running in the background and prevent itself from being uninstalled, which allowed it to boost its monthly active user rates, Hyppönen said. It also had the ability to spy on competitors by tracking activity on other shopping apps and getting information from them, he added.

Check Point Research additionally identified ways in which the app was able to evade scrutiny.

The app deployed a method that allowed it to push updates without an app store review process meant to detect malicious applications, the researchers said.

They also identified in some plug-ins the intent to obscure potentially malicious components by hiding them under legitimate file names, such as Google’s.

“Such a technique is widely used by malware developers that inject malicious code into applications that have legitimate functionality,” they said.

Android targeted

In China, about three quarters of smartphone users are on the Android system. Apple (AAPL)’s iPhone has 25% market share, according to Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities.

Sergey Toshin, the founder of Oversecured, said Pinduoduo’s malware specifically targeted different Android-based operating systems, including those used by Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo.

CNN has reached out to these companies for comment.

Toshin described Pinduoduo as “the most dangerous malware” ever found among mainstream apps.

“I’ve never seen anything like this before. It’s like, super expansive,” he said.

Most phone manufacturers globally customize the core Android software, the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), to add unique features and applications to their own devices.

Toshin found Pinduoduo to have exploited about 50 Android system vulnerabilities. Most of the exploits were tailor made for customized parts known as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) code, which tends to be audited less often than AOSP and is therefore more prone to vulnerabilities, he said.

Pinduoduo also exploited a number of AOSP vulnerabilities, including one which was flagged by Toshin to Google in February 2022. Google fixed the bug this March, he said.

I’ve never seen anything like this before. It’s like, super expansive. Sergey Toshin, Android security expert

According to Toshin, the exploits allowed Pinduoduo access to users’ locations, contacts, calendars, notifications and photo albums without their consent. They were also able to change system settings and access users’ social network accounts and chats, he said.

Of the six teams CNN spoke to for this story, three did not conduct full examinations. But their primary reviews showed that Pinduoduo asked for a large number of permissions beyond the normal functions of a shopping app.

They included “potentially invasive permissions” such as “set wallpaper” and “download without notification,” said René Mayrhofer, head of the Institute of Networks and Security at the Johannes Kepler University Linz in Austria.

Disbanding the team

Suspicions about malware in Pinduoduo’s app were first raised in late February in a report by a Chinese cybersecurity firm called Dark Navy. Even though the analysis didn’t directly name the shopping giant, the report spread quickly among other researchers, who did name the company. Some of the analysts followed up with their own reports confirming the original findings.

Soon after, on March 5, Pinduoduo issued a new update of its app, version 6.50.0, which removed the exploits, according to two experts who CNN spoke to.

Two days after the update, Pinduoduo disbanded the team of engineers and product managers who had developed the exploits, according to the Pinduoduo source.

The next day, team members found themselves locked out of Pinduoduo’s bespoke workplace communication app, Knock, and lost access to files on the company’s internal network. Engineers also found their access to big data, data sheets and the log system revoked, the source said.

Most of the team were transferred to work at Temu. They were assigned to different departments at the subsidiary, with some working on marketing or developing push notifications, according to the source.

A core group of about 20 cybersecurity engineers who specialize in finding and exploiting vulnerabilities remain at Pinduoduo, they said.

Toshin of Oversecured, who looked into the update, said although the exploits were removed, the underlying code was still there and could be reactivated to carry out attacks.

Oversight failure

Pinduoduo has been able to grow its user base against a backdrop of the Chinese government’s regulatory clampdown on Big Tech that began in late 2020.

That year, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology launched a sweeping crackdown on apps that illegally collect and use personal data.

In 2021, Beijing passed its first comprehensive data privacy legislation.

The Personal Information Protection Law stipulates that no party should illegally collect, process or transmit personal information. They’re also banned from exploiting internet-related security vulnerabilities or engaging in actions that endanger cybersecurity.

Pinduoduo’s apparent malware would be a violation of those laws, tech policy experts say, and should have been detected by the regulator.

“This would be embarrassing for the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, because this is their job,” said Kendra Schaefer, a tech policy expert at Trivium China, a consultancy. “They’re supposed to check Pinduoduo, and the fact that they didn’t find (anything) is embarrassing for the regulator.”

The ministry has regularly published lists to name and shame apps found to have undermined user privacy or other rights. It also publishes a separate list of apps that are removed from app stores for failing to comply with regulations.

Pinduoduo did not appear on any of the lists.

CNN has reached out to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the Cyberspace Administration of China for comment.

On Chinese social media, some cybersecurity experts questioned why regulators haven’t taken any action.

“Probably none of our regulators can understand coding and programming, nor do they understand technology. You can’t even understand the malicious code when it’s shoved right in front of your face,” a cybersecurity expert with 1.8 million followers wrote last week in a viral post on Weibo, a Twitter-like platform.

The $500 billion beauty industry’s ‘green’ ambitions are a patchwork at best. And they’re falling short,"CNN —

The escalating climate crisis is shifting many people’s purchasing patterns and this extends to the $500 billion dollar global beauty industry which is grappling with a range of sustainability challenges across product manufacturing, packaging and disposal.

Strategy and consulting firm Simon Kucher’s Global Sustainability Study 2021 found 60% of consumers around the world rated sustainability as an important purchase criterion, and 35% were willing to pay more for sustainable products or services.

This shift in consumer preferences has propelled many beauty brands to set environmental goals: to move away from single-use and virgin plastics, provide recyclable, reusable and refillable packaging and offer more transparency around products’ ingredients so customers can ascertain how “green” their purchase is.

However, consumers still struggle to understand the sustainability credentials of many products, according to the British Beauty Council. This is because the industry’s clean-up efforts have been inconsistent, and fall short of making a recognizable impact in the absence of collective goal-setting, global strategy and standardized regulations.

Ingredient and branding transparency

There is no international standard for the beauty industry on how much product ingredient information to share with customers — or how to do so. Brands can set their own rules and goals, giving rise to confusion and “greenwashing,” where sustainability claims are often touted but not substantiated.

Companies often use marketing language like “clean beauty” to make it seem like their products are natural, for example, when they may not actually be organic, sustainable or ethically made.

“The term ‘clean beauty’ has become quite dangerous. It’s used to sell more products,” according to British Beauty Council CEO Millie Kendall, who added that such buzzwords are losing traction in the UK as British customers wise up to their shortcomings. “Customers need better marketing information and certification information.”

In a 2021 report calling on the industry to have “the courage to change” their business practices, the British Beauty Council wrote that, all too often, even natural ingredients involved in manufacturing products give way to “over-consumption, non-regenerative farming practices, pollution, waste and neglect.”

“The only way out of this is transparency,” Kendall told CNN.

Jen Lee, chief impact officer at US-based brand Beautycounter, said she continues to see confusion over ingredients among consumers. (In 2013, the company launched and published “The Never List,” which currently cites more than 2,800 chemicals — including heavy metals, parabens and formaldehyde — it claims to never use in its products.)

“Natural vs. synthetic ingredients has been a conversation. People think natural is safer, but it’s not always the case,” Lee explained. “Natural ingredients formulated in the industry can have toxic load. Heavy metals can occur in natural components of the earth.”

“We used to be more natural and organic,” added Sasha Plavsic, founder of makeup brand ILIA Beauty. “What was challenging is (that) raw materials were difficult to source or would come in inconsistently or products wouldn’t perform.”

Most makeup is created and molded at high temperatures, Plavsic explained. Purely organic materials often fall apart in this heat, leading to inconsistent results and subpar product performance. “Not every synthetic is bad,” Plavsic said. “Sometimes, it helps create the best in class formula.”

Unpacking plastics

The industry’s plastic packaging is a particular sustainability challenge — 95% is thrown away and the vast majority is not recycled, according to the British Beauty Council.

The cosmetics business is the fourth biggest plastic packaging user globally — after food and beverage, industrial packaging and pharmaceuticals — and plastic is about 67% of the industry’s packaging volume, according to Vantage Market Research. Beauty giant L’Oreal used 144,430 metric tons of plastic in its packaging material in 2021, for example, according to the Ellen Macarthur Foundation (EMF). Estee Lauder Companies reported its brands produced 71,600 metric tons of plastic in product packaging that same year.

And only 9% of the global plastic waste is recycled, according to a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The United States only recycles 4% of its plastic waste.

Many brands are trying to phase out harmful plastics from their operations and adopt post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic. (L’Oreal has set a target of 50% PCR plastic usage by 2025, while Estee Lauder is targeting 25% “or more” PCR plastic — but both are far from achieving their targets.)

“Between 60-70 major global brands have made unprecedented progress” in PCR plastic usage across industries, EMF’s Plastic Initiative Lead Sander DeFruyt told CNN. But DeFruyt stressed that PCR plastic must be adopted in conjunction with brands removing single and virgin plastics from their usage cycles to truly make a difference.

However, PCR plastic is not easy to find — low recycling rates around the world mean there is limited supply. Meanwhile, demand for it is growing demand across industries, DeFruyt said. This competition hikes up its price, which is already higher than virgin plastic.

Hair care brand FEKKAI claims that it used up to 95% PCR content in its packaging, but pricing and supply issues posed a challenge, forcing it to currently aim for containers and packaging that feature at least 50% PCR in its packaging.

“PCR plastic is more expensive than stock plastic. The cost is hard and then sourcing it is too,” founder Frédéric Fekkai told CNN. “PCR is close to our heart, but there is a massive demand, so finding recycled plastic is difficult.”

The weight of retail

Beauty retailers plays a pivotal — and under-utilized — role, with control over stocking decisions and supply chains. But many vary when it comes to the standards they set for brands they sell.

“Smaller businesses do more, full stop,” said Jessi Baker, founder of the technology platform Provenance, which helps brands display their sustainability credentials for customers. “They move more nimbly. Some of them are born-good brands — climate friendliness was part of their setup. They don’t need to restructure their entire supply chain. Their culture already has it compared to the larger brands who need to work hard to change.”

Sephora launched its “Clean + Planet Positive” initiative in 2021, which labeled products that met its set criteria. (This is separate from the French retailer’s “Clean at Sephora” program, which is currently facing a consumer lawsuit alleging it carries a significant percentage of products understood by customers to be harmful.) Target launched a similar program in 2022, featuring a “Target Zero” icon for both online and in-store offerings that either have reusable, recyclable, compostable or reduced plastic packaging, or feature waterless or concentrated products.

Still, many steps taken by brands and retailers do not even begin to touch on the waste and pollution generated throughout supply chains, manufacturing and shipping, all huge problems for the industry to grapple with.

The missing player

The gaps in standardization in the beauty ecosystem can, to some extent, be filled by certifications such as the US-born B Corporation, or B Corp. This accreditation, one of the most well-known in the beauty space, is issued by the non-profit B Lab, which scores a company on a variety of criteria around ethics and sustainability. However beneficial it may be among eco-conscious consumers, though, it is currently completely voluntary for brands to apply for.

Governments and multinationals enforcing regulations and setting a base line for brands to operate from when making sustainability claims would go a long way to making change, many experts and business leaders believe.

Susanne Kaufmann, founder of her namesake beauty brand, says her efforts in Austria would reap better results if more countries around the world had stricter, more uniform garbage disposal laws.

“I package our product in a recyclable material,” Kaufmann said. (Her products’ packaging, which is refillable and reusable, is made from 75% recycled plastic — and is 100% recyclable.) If I send this to the US, the garbage is not separated… and it’s not recyclable,” she explained, referring to inconsistencies in recycling laws across the United States.

And when it comes to ingredients, the European Chemicals Agency lists 2,495 substances banned from use in cosmetic products marketed for sale or use in the bloc. But the US Food and Drug administration only lists 11, making it more challenging for American consumers to find safer, greener options. The Environmental Working Group, a non-profit watchdog, studied lab tests of 51 sunscreen products in 2021 and found that only 35% of products met the EU standard, compared with 94% that passed the US standard.

However, while government can set minimum requirements, Mia Davis, vice president of sustainability and impact at beauty retailer Credo Beauty, says the needle will move in the private sector.

“Regulation can raise the floor a bit. A person who doesn’t know about any (sustainability issues) should still be able to walk into a bodega and get clean products… But that’s never going to be what the market can do,” she said. “Market leadership is key.”

In the absence of bold regulations or global standards on sustainability practices, this “leadership” — undertaken both by brands and customers in the beauty marketplace — is likely to be the most immediately impactful vector for addressing the industry’s climate shortcomings. It will take continued collective advocacy and initiative to see meaningful climate-conscious change.",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/beauty-skincare-climate/index.html,1
A new approach to a Covid-19 nasal vaccine shows early promise,"CNN —

Scientists in Germany say they’ve been able to make a nasal vaccine that can shut down a Covid-19 infection in the nose and throat, where the virus gets its first foothold in the body.

In experiments in hamsters, two doses of the vaccine – which is made with a live but weakened form of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 – blocked the virus from copying itself in the animals’ upper airways, achieving “sterilizing immunity” and preventing illness, a long-sought goal of the pandemic.

Although this vaccine has several more hurdles to clear before it gets to a doctor’s office or drug store, other nasal vaccines are in use or are nearing the finish line in clinical trials.

China and India both rolled out vaccines given through the nasal tissues last fall, though it’s not clear how well they may be working. Studies on the effectiveness of these vaccines have yet to be published, leaving much of the world to wonder whether this approach to protection really works in people.

Halting progress on next-generation Covid-19 vaccines

The US has reached something of a stalemate with Covid-19. Even with the darkest days of the pandemic behind us, hundreds of Americans are still dying daily as the infection continues to simmer in the background of our return to normal life.

As long as the virus continues to spread among people and animals, there’s always the potential for it mutate into a more contagious or more damaging version of itself. And while Covid infections have become manageable for most healthy people, they may still pose a danger to vulnerable groups such as the elderly and immunocompromised.

Researchers hope next-generation Covid-19 vaccines, which aim to shut down the virus before it ever gets a chance to make us sick and ultimately prevent the spread of infection, could make our newest resident respiratory infection less of a threat.

One way scientists are trying to do that is by boosting mucosal immunity, beefing up immune defenses in the tissues that line the upper airways, right where the virus would land and begin to infect our cells.

It’s a bit like stationing firefighters underneath the smoke alarm in your house, says study author Emanuel Wyler, a scientist at the Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association in Berlin.

The immunity that’s created by shots works throughout the body, but it resides primarily in the blood. That means it may take longer to mount a response.

“If they are already on site, they can immediately eliminate the fire, but if they’re like 2 miles away, they first need to drive there, and by that time, one-third of the house is already in full flames,” Wyler said.

Mucosal vaccines are also better at priming a different kind of first responder than injections do. They do a better job of summoning IgA antibodies, which have four arms to grab onto invaders instead of the two arms that the y-shaped IgG antibodies have. Some scientists think IgA antibodies may be less picky about their targets than IgG antibodies, which makes them better equipped to deal with new variants.

The new nasal vaccine takes a new approach to a very old idea: weakening a virus so it’s no longer a threat and then giving it to people so their immune systems can learn to recognize and fight it off. The first vaccines using this approach date to the 1870s, against anthrax and rabies. Back then, scientists weakened the agents they were using with heat and chemicals.

The researchers manipulated the genetic material in the virus to make it harder for cells to translate. This technique, called codon pair deoptimization, hobbles the virus so it can be shown to the immune system without making the body sick.

“You could imagine reading a text … and every letter is a different font, or every letter is a different size, then the text is much harder to read. And this is basically what we do in codon pair deoptimization,” Wyler said.

Promising results in animal studies

In the hamster studies, which were published Monday in the journal Nature Microbiology, two doses of the live but weakened nasal vaccine created a much stronger immune response than either two doses of an mRNA-based vaccine or one that uses an adenovirus to ferry the vaccine instructions into cells.

The researchers think the live weakened vaccine probably worked better because it closely mimics the process of a natural infection.

The nasal vaccine also previews the entire coronavirus for the body, not just its spike proteins like current Covid-19 vaccines do, so the hamsters were able to make immune weapons against a wider range of targets.

As promising as all this sounds, vaccine experts say caution is warranted. This vaccine still has to pass more tests before it’s ready for use, but they say the results look encouraging.

“They did a very nice job. This is obviously a competent and thoughtful team that did this work, and impressive in the scope of what they did. Now it just needs to be repeated,” perhaps in primates and certainly in humans before it can be widely used, said Dr. Greg Poland, who designs vaccines at the Mayo Clinic. He was not involved in the new research.

The study began in 2021, before the Omicron variant was around, so the vaccine tested in these experiments was made with the original strain of the coronavirus. In the experiments, when they infected animals with Omicron, the live but weakened nasal vaccine still performed better than the others, but its ability to neutralize the virus was diminished. Researchers think it will need an update.

It also needs to be tested in humans, and Wyler says they’re working on that. The scientists have partnered with a Swiss company called RocketVax to start phase I clinical trials.

Other vaccines are further along, but the progress has been “slow and halting,” Poland said. Groups working on these vaccines are struggling to raise the steep costs of getting a new vaccine to market, and they’re doing it in a setting where people tend to think the vaccine race has been won and done.

In reality, Poland said, we’re far from that. All it would take is another Omicron-level shift in the evolution of the virus, and we could be back at square one, with no effective tools against the coronavirus.

“That’s foolish. We should be developing a pan-coronavirus vaccine that does induce mucosal immunity and that is long-lived,” he said.

More on the way

At least four nasal vaccines for Covid-19 have reached late-stage testing in people, according to the World Health Organization’s vaccine tracker.

The nasal vaccines in use in China and India rely on harmless adenoviruses to ferry their instructions into cells, although effectiveness data for these has not been published.

Two other nasal vaccines are finishing human studies.

One, a recombinant vaccine that can be produced cheaply in chicken eggs, the same way many flu vaccines are, is being put through its paces by researchers at Mount Sinai in New York City.

Another, like the German vaccine, uses a live but weakened version of the virus. It’s being developed by a company called Codagenix. Results of those studies, which were carried out in South America and Africa, may come later this year.

The German team says it’s eagerly watching for the Codagenix data.

“They will be very important in order to know where whether this kind of attempt is basically promising or not,” Wyler said.

They have reason to worry. Respiratory infections have proved to be tough targets for inhaled vaccines.

FluMist, a live but weakened form of the flu virus, works reasonably well in children but doesn’t help adults as much. The reason is thought to be that adults already have immune memory for the flu, and when the virus is injected into the nose, the vaccine mostly boosts what’s already there.

Still, some of the most potent vaccines such as the vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella use live attenuated viruses, so it’s a promising approach.

Another consideration is that live vaccines can’t be taken by everyone. People with very compromised immunity are often cautioned against using live vaccines because even these very weakened viruses may be risky for them.

“Although it’s strongly attenuated, it’s still a real virus,” Wyler said, so it would have to be used carefully.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/health/nasal-vaccine-sterilizing-immunity/index.html,1

"Israeli military veterans, a backbone of protest movement, vow to keep demonstrating","Tel Aviv CNN —

In a sea of Israeli flags, Yiftach Golov holds one that looks a little different.

Among the hundreds of thousands of protesters who took to the streets for the 13th week in a row on Saturday, Golov hoists a brown flag that represents a group called “Brother and Sisters in Arms.”

They are veterans – many, like Golov, from elite forces – who now feel they are fighting on a new battlefield: To save Israeli democracy.

“We believe this is our responsibility to go once again called to the flag of the nation to stop this madness to defend Israel,” Golov said, as he weaved his way through the protesters on Tel Aviv’s Kaplan street, between the high-rises that house many of Israel’s high tech companies.

During the second intifada, in the early 2000s, Golov served in a special forces reconnaissance unit. He was never before particularly political, focusing more on getting his PhD in biophysics from Tel Aviv University.

But when the protest movement against the Israeli government’s judicial overhaul plan began in January, Golov attended one a demonstration and soon became one of thousands of veterans, and now military reservists, who have taken up the cause as their new mission.

Some, including elite Air Force reservists, have taken it a step further, threatening not to heed the call to train or even serve in protest of the government’s plans planned judicial changes, which would give the governing parties more control over Israel’s judiciary.

Others have taken to becoming some of the most active organizers and demonstrators. Last week, a group from Brothers and Sisters in Arms protested by carrying a figure wrapped in the Israeli flag on a stretcher, the way they would carry a wounded comrade off the field.

While Golov says he has not taken the drastic step to refuse service, he understands the motivation.

“We’re fighting for justice and liberty, just like the American story, that’s the values that that are being represented symbolized back when we look at our flag, that’s something that was lacking lacking for the last few decades. So basically, we reclaim the flag,” he said.

Fellow members of the group, all wearing brown shirts with the organization’s logo, come up and say hello. They’re sprinkled all throughout the protests. One is even leading the “Pink Front,” a group of coordinated drummers who look like they are dressed for a rave, and often lead the chants at the protests.

They’re using skills they learned in the military – how to organize, how to mobilize – now for the protests. But more importantly, they say they have the same type of motivation.

“The very deep feeling that you are part of something bigger than yourself, that (you’re) allowed to sacrifice anything that is needed, whether it’s your career, health, seriously mental health,” Golov said. “We all have a mission, you’re willing to do it at any cost. You’re very determined, you know that you are on the right side, you’re carrying the torch of light. That keeps us being highly motivated despite the fact that we’re not sleeping for days.”

Israel’s protest movement is made up of many disparate groups, but the pressure from Israel’s much vaunted veterans has been seen as a key to moving the needle.

Last Monday, after weeks of sustained protests and the largest general strike in Israeli history, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a pause to the legislation, to allow time for negotiations with the opposition.

But despite the announcements, protesters are still out in the streets in large numbers. CNN affiliate Channel 12 in Israel estimated the size of Saturday’s demonstration in Tel Aviv at about 150,000 people. Organizers claimed it was 230,000.

Last week’s mass protests and widespread strike action came after Netanyahu said he had decided to fire Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for advocating a delay in passing the legislation – a move that Netanyahu has since delayed, sources told CNN, due to “the present security situation.”

In his televised speech calling for a delay, Gallant had said the pause in the legislation was needed “for the security of Israel,” citing the refusal of some Israel Defense Forces reservists to train in protest of the government plans. He said pressing ahead with the proposals could threaten Israel’s security.

Under pressure at home and from allies abroad, Netanyahu said he would delay votes on the remaining legislation until after the Knesset’s Passover recess in April “to give time for a real chance for a real debate.”

“Out of the responsibility to the nation, I decided to delay … the vote, in order to give time for discussion,” he added.

But Netanyahu indicated that the delay was only temporary. He insisted that the overhaul was necessary, and reiterated criticism of refusal to train or serve in the military in protest at the planned changes. “Refusing is the end of our country,” he said.

Many protesters don’t believe that the pause is real, or say it’s simply a stalling tactic to give Netanyahu some breathing room and get the protesters to go home before he plows on with the reforms.

“We will start doing deactivation only when we will know 100% that Israel state will stay a functional democratic country. Whatever needs to be done for that,” Golov said.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/middleeast/israel-protests-military-veterans-intl-cmd/index.html,1
Erdogan’s political fate may be determined by Turkey’s Kurds,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.

Abu Dhabi, UAE CNN —

Turkey’s persecuted pro-Kurdish party has emerged as a kingmaker in the country’s upcoming election, playing a decisive role that may just tip the balance enough to unseat two-decade ruler Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

In a key setback to the Turkish president and leader of the Justice and Development Party (AK Party), the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) last month announced that it would not put forward its own presidential candidate, a move analysts say allows its supporters to vote for Erdogan’s main rival.

“We are facing a turning point that will shape the future of Turkey and (its) society,” said the HDP in a statement on March 23. “To fulfill our historical responsibility against the one-man rule, we will not field a presidential candidate in (the) May 14 elections.”

It is a twist of irony for the Turkish strongman, who spent the better half of the past decade cracking down on the party after it began chipping away at his voter base. Its former leader Selahattin Demirtas has been in prison for nearly seven years and the party faces possible closure by a court for suspected collusion with the militant Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and affiliated groups. But its influence may nonetheless determine the course of Turkey’s politics.

The HDP’s decision not to field a candidate came just three days after head of the Republican People’s Party (CHP) Kemal Kilicdaroglu, Erdogan’s main rival, visited the party’s co-chairs. He told reporters that the solution to Turkey’s problems, “including the Kurdish problem” lies in parliament,” according to Turkish media.

Kilicdaroglu, who represents the six-party Nation Alliance opposition bloc, is the strongest contender to run against Erdogan in years. And while the HDP hasn’t yet announced whether it will put its weight behind him, analysts say it is the kingmaker in the elections.

“It was a carefully crafted political discourse,” Hisyar Ozsoy, deputy co-chair of the HDP and a member of parliament from the predominantly Kurdish province of Diyarbakir, told CNN. “We are not going to have our own candidate, and we will leave it to the international community to interpret it the way they wish.”

Experts say the crackdown on the HDP is rooted in the threat it poses to Erdogan politically, as well as its position as one of the main parties representing Turkey’s Kurds, an ethnic minority from which a separatist militant movement has emerged.

The party and the Kurdish people have had a complicated relationship with Erdogan. The leader courted the Kurds in earlier years by granting them more rights and reversing restrictions on the use of their language. Relations with the HDP were also cordial once, as Erdogan worked with the party on a brief peace process with the PKK.

But ties between Erdogan and the HDP later turned sour, and the HDP fell under a sweeping crackdown aimed at the PKK and their affiliates.

Kurds are the biggest minority in Turkey, making up between 15% and 20% of the population, according to Minority Rights Group International.

It is unclear if the HDP will endorse Kilicdaroglu, but analysts say that the deliberate distance may be beneficial for the opposition candidate.

Precarious position

The accusations against the HDP place it in a precarious position during the elections. It currently faces a case in Turkey’s Constitutional Court over suspected ties to the PKK, which is designated as a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Knowing it may be banned at any moment, its candidates are running under the Green Left Party in parliament.

If the opposition is seen as allying with the HDP, Erdogan’s AK Party may use its influence in the media to discredit it as being pro-PKK, said Murat Somer, a political science professor at Koc University in Istanbul and author of Return to Point Zero, a book on the Turkish-Kurdish question in Turkey.

The HDP’s threat to Erdogan’s hold on power became apparent after the June 2015 election, the first general election it participated in. It won 13% of the seats, denying the ruling AK Party its majority for the first time since 2002. Erdogan, however, called a snap election five months later, which led to a drop in the HDP’s support to 10.7%, as well as the restoration of the AK Party’s overall majority.

“They are a kingmaker in these elections because the HDP gets about half of the votes of the Kurdish population in Turkey,” said Somer, adding that the other, more conservative Kurdish voters have traditionally voted for Erdogan’s AK Party. And last month, the Free Cause Party (HUDA-PAR), a tiny Kurdish-Islamist party announced support for Erdogan in the elections. The party has never won seats in parliament.

The HDP knows that its position is key to the outcome of next month’s vote, but that it’s also in a delicate situation.

“We want to play the game wisely, and we need to be very careful,” said Ozsoy, adding that the party wants to avoid a “contaminated political climate” where the elections are polarized “between a very ugly ultra-nationalist discourse against Kilicdaroglu and others.”

The party was founded in 2012 with a number of aims, said Ozsoy, one of which was “peaceful and democratic resolution of the Kurdish conflict.”

Somer said that the party was seen to be “an initiative” of the PKK, which later led to a heavy government crackdown on it in the name of counterterrorism.

Its former leader Demirtas remains an influential figure.

The Turkish government has been trying to link the HDP to the PKK but has so far failed to prove “a real connection,” said Asli Aydintasbas, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC.

A post-Erdogan Turkey may give some breathing space to the Kurds and Kurdish-dominated parties in Turkey, Aydintasbas told CNN, noting that many Kurdish voters have recently left Erdogan’s camp. “For HDP, this is more than just an ideological choice,” she said. “It’s a matter of survival.”

Ozsoy says his party understands what’s at stake, not only for Turkey’s Kurds but for all its minorities.

“We are aware of our responsibility here. We are aware of our role. We know we are in a kingmaker position,” the HDP lawmaker said.

Two women arrested for not wearing hijab following ‘yogurt attack’

Two women were arrested in Iran for failing to wear the hijab in public, after a man threw a tub of yogurt at them at a store in the city of Shandiz on Thursday, according to Mizan News Agency, the state-run outlet for Iran’s judiciary.

Background: A video and report published by the Mizan News Agency showed footage of the man approaching one of the unveiled women and speaking to her before he grabs a tub of yogurt and throws it, hitting both women on the head. The video appears to show a male staff member removing the man from the store. The two women were arrested, as well as the man who threw the yogurt, according to local media.

Why it matters: Iranians have taken to the streets in protest for several months against Iran’s mandatory hijab law, as well as other political and social issues across the country. The Iranian government has continued to crack down on the protests, and on Saturday, Iran’s Ministry of Interior said that the “hijab is an unquestionable religious necessity.”

Oil prices surge after OPEC+ producers announce surprise cuts

Oil prices spiked Monday after OPEC+ producers unexpectedly announced that they would cut output. Brent crude, the global benchmark, jumped 5.31% to $84.13 a barrel, while WTI, the US benchmark, rose 5.48% to $79.83. Both were the sharpest price rises in almost a year. The collective output cut by the nine members of OPEC+ totals 1.66 million barrels per day.

Background: The reductions are on top of the 2 million barrels per day (bpd) cuts announced by OPEC+ in October and bring the total volume of cuts by OPEC+ to 3.66 million bpd, equal to 3.7% of global demand. In a note Sunday, Goldman Sachs analysts said the move was unexpected but “consistent with the new OPEC+ doctrine to act pre-emptively because they can, without significant losses in market share.”

Why it matters: The White House pushed back on the cuts by OPEC+. “We don’t think cuts are advisable at this moment given market uncertainty – and we’ve made that clear,” a spokesperson for the National Security Council said. “We’re focused on prices for American consumers, not barrels.” In October, OPEC+’s decision to cut production had already rankled the White House. US President Joe Biden pledged at the time that Saudi Arabia would suffer “consequences.” But so far, his administration appears to have backed off on its vows to punish the kingdom.

Iran blames Israel for the killing of second IRGC officer, vows to respond

A second Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) officer died following an attack in Syria on Friday, according to Iranian state media on Sunday. Iranian state media said the Iranian military adviser died after an Israeli attack near the Syrian capital Damascus left him wounded. The attack also killed another IRGC officer. In a tweet on Sunday, Iranian government spokesman Ali Bahadori Jahromi said the alleged Israeli attack wouldn’t go unanswered. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said on Sunday that Iran has the right to respond to “state terrorism.”

Background: The Friday airstrike hit a “site in the Damascus countryside,” Syrian state news agency SANA said. Israel declined CNN’s request for comment on reports of airstrikes near Damascus on Friday, saying its military doesn’t comment on reports in the foreign media. Iranian influence has grown in Syria since a civil war broke out in the country more than a decade ago, with the IRGC building a substantial presence as “advisers” to the Syrian armed forces.

Why it matters: The Israeli military declined to comment, but it has previously claimed responsibility for attacks it has described as Iranian-linked targets in Syria. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting Sunday: “We are exacting a high price from the regimes that support terrorism, beyond Israel’s borders. I suggest that our enemies not err. Israel’s internal debate will not detract one iota from our determination, strength and ability to act against our enemies on all fronts, wherever and whenever necessary.”

China and Brazil have reached an agreement to ditch USD and use their own currencies—China Daily pic.twitter.com/q33U4kVO5Q — IRNA News Agency (@IrnaEnglish) March 30, 2023

An Iranian state news outlet is gloating at what it sees as the demise of the US dollar.

IRNA recreated a popular meme to mark China and Brazil’s decision to reportedly ditch the US dollar as an intermediary in trade, citing the Chinese state news outlet, China Daily. It shows two men representing China and Brazil posing in front of a grave labelled “USD.”

The meme was pinned to the top of IRNA’s Twitter page, and was met with laughter and ridicule. “Dream on,” said another user, pointing to the dollar’s use as the main reserve currency around the world.

China Daily said that the agreement was part of “the rising global use of the Chinese renminbi.” It would reportedly enable China and Brazil to conduct trade and financial transactions using local currencies instead of the dollar.

Micron Technology: China probes US chip maker for cybersecurity risks as tech tension escalates,"Hong Kong CNN —

China has launched a cybersecurity probe into Micron Technology, one of America’s largest memory chip makers, in apparent retaliation after US allies in Asia and Europe announced new restrictions on the sale of key technology to Beijing.

The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) will review products sold by Micron in the country, according to a statement by the watchdog late on Friday.

The move is aimed at “ensuring the security of key information infrastructure supply chains, preventing cybersecurity risks caused by hidden product problems, and maintaining national security,” it noted.

It came on the same day that Japan, a US ally, said it would restrict the export of advanced chip manufacturing equipment to countries including China, following similar moves by the United States and the Netherlands.

Washington and its allies have announced curbs on China’s semiconductor industry, which strike at the heart of Beijing’s bid to become a tech superpower.

Last month, the Netherlands also unveiled new restrictions on overseas sales of semiconductor technology, citing the need to protect national security. In October, the United States banned Chinese companies from buying advanced chips and chipmaking equipment without a license.

Micron told CNN it was aware of the review.

“We are in communication with the CAC and are cooperating fully,” it said, adding that it stands by the security of its products. “Micron’s product shipments, engineering, manufacturing, sales and other functions are operating as normal.”

Risks expected

Shares in Micron sank 4.4% on Wall Street Friday following the news, the biggest drop in more than three months. On Monday, they closed another 1.2% lower. Micron derives more than 10% of its revenue from China.

In an earlier filing, the Idaho-based company had warned of such risks.

“The Chinese government may restrict us from participating in the China market or may prevent us from competing effectively with Chinese companies,” it said last week.

China has strongly criticized restrictions on tech exports, saying last month it “firmly opposes” such measures.

In efforts to boost growth and job creation, Beijing is seeking to woo foreign investments as it grapples with mounting economic challenges. The newly minted premier Li Qiang and several top economic officials have been rolling out the welcome wagon for global CEOs and promising they would “provide a good environment and services.”

But Beijing has also exerted growing pressure on foreign companies to bring them into line with its agenda.

Last month, authorities closed the Beijing office of Mintz Group, a US corporate intelligence firm, and detained five local staff.

Days earlier, they suspended Deloitte’s operations in Beijing for three months and imposed a fine of $31 million over alleged lapses in its work auditing a state-owned distressed debt manager.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/tech/china-micron-probe-us-chip-war-intl-hnk/index.html,1

"China Renaissance suspends trading, delays results after founder Bao Fan goes missing","Hong Kong CNN —

China Renaissance, a top dealmaker in the country’s tech industry, said it would suspend trading of its shares and delay the release of its annual results because it still can’t get in touch with its founder.

Bao Fan, 52, started the boutique investment bank in 2005 and has been unreachable since the middle of February, according to the company. Shares in China Renaissance have plunged since Bao went missing, at one point dropping as much as 50%.

China Renaissance said in late February that it had learned Bao was “cooperating in an investigation” being carried out by certain authorities in the country. It gave no other details.

Chinese media have reported Bao might be assisting in an investigation related to a former executive at China Renaissance.

In a filing on Sunday, China Renaissance said auditors couldn’t complete their work or sign off on their report because of Bao’s absence. The board was also unable to give an estimate about when it would be able to approve its audited results for 2022 or dispatch its annual report by an April 30 deadline as required by Hong Kong’s listing rules.

Trading in the company’s shares was suspended from Monday as a result.

Bao is known as a veteran dealmaker who works closely with top technology companies in China. He helped broker the 2015 merger between two of the country’s leading food delivery services, Meituan and Dianping. Today, the combined company’s “super app” platform is ubiquitous in China.

His team has also invested in US-listed Chinese electric vehicle makers Nio (NIO) and Li Auto and helped Chinese internet giants Baidu (BIDU) and JD.com (JD) complete their secondary listings in Hong Kong.

Over the weekend, China’s top anti-graft watchdog launched an investigation into Liu Liange, former party secretary and chairman of Bank of China, according to a statement by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Supervision Commission. The bank is state-owned and one of the country’s four biggest lenders.

Liu is suspected of “serious violations of discipline and law,” the statement said. He is among the most senior financial executives targeted in a broader financial crackdown by President Xi Jinping.

In January, Wang Bin, former party chief and chairman of China Life Insurance, was charged by national-level prosecutors with taking bribes and hiding overseas savings.

HSBC spinoff: Bank’s top execs face tense shareholders in Hong Kong calling for a breakup,"Hong Kong CNN —

HSBC’s top brass defended their strategy Monday to frustrated shareholders in the lender’s largest market, as Europe’s biggest bank continued to face calls to be split up.

At an informal shareholder meeting in Hong Kong, Chairman Mark Tucker and CEO Noel Quinn took questions from investors on issues ranging from how the bank was approaching demands for an overhaul of its business to its purchase of Silicon Valley Bank’s UK arm.

In prepared remarks, Tucker and Quinn each reiterated the board’s recommendation that shareholders vote against a resolution on the docket for its annual general meeting in May that would force the bank to come up with a plan to spin off or reorganize its Asian business — the lender’s main source of profits.

Tucker said the board was unanimous in its opposition to the resolution, stating plainly: “It would not be in your interest to split the bank.”

He said the board had previously reviewed a range of options for restructuring the bank, and concluded that such alternatives would “materially destroy value for shareholders,” including dividends.

“Our strategy is working,” Tucker told the room of more than 1,000 shareholders. “Our current strategy is moving dividends up.”

Calls for a breakup

HSBC has been facing calls to separate its Asian business from the rest of the bank over the past year.

Shareholders in Hong Kong — where HSBC is a mainstay of many retail investors’ portfolios — contend that the London-based lender’s performance has been dragged down by its businesses in other regions.

Quinn addressed those complaints head-on Monday, saying “our profits in Hong Kong and the UK are no longer being dragged down by underperformance elsewhere. The group is performing well as a whole.”

Pressed later by a shareholder on the issue, Quinn said a breakup of the bank would result in “significant revenue loss” because much of its business relied on cross-border transactions.

Investors have also been unhappy with HSBC scrapping its dividend in 2020, at the request of British regulators. They argue that if the lender cordoned off its activities in Asia, it would no longer have to expose Hong Kong shareholders to requests in other jurisdictions.

Christine Fong, a district council member in Hong Kong, said she represented about 500 small shareholders who had been affected by the dividend cancellation.

“Street hawkers, taxi drivers or teachers — they all relied on the dividend to pay for their regular expenses, like mortgage, insurance payments, school fees,” Fong told CNN.

“That’s why, three years ago, what HSBC did upset those small minority shareholders.”

Fong has now joined calls for shareholders to vote in favor of the proposal for the bank to spin off its Asian business, despite the lender bringing back its dividend in 2021, albeit at a lower level.

Ken Lui, an activist shareholder in Hong Kong who put the resolution together, doubled down on his call for support ahead of the meeting Monday.

The resolution will require 75% of votes to be passed in May, but “nothing is impossible,” he told reporters outside the meeting venue.

Lui, who said he personally held a stake worth 100 million Hong Kong dollars ($12.7 million), laid out plans for his team to focus on “targeted outreach to institutional shareholders to present our case and gain their support.”

His group will also canvass 18 districts of Hong Kong “to tell HSBC shareholders that they finally have a chance to speak for themselves and protect their rights through voting,” he added.

The Ping An question

HSBC is also facing pressure from its largest shareholder.

Ping An (PNGAY), China’s biggest insurer, holds an 8% stake in HSBC and has backed calls for the bank to rethink its structure.

In a series of remarks made public by the Chinese firm last November, Huang Yong, chairman of Ping An’s asset management arm, said “we will support any initiatives including a spinoff that are conducive to improve HSBC’s performance and value.”

Since then, the insurance giant’s views haven’t changed, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The source told CNN that Ping An has been calling for HSBC to explore a reorganization, with an eye on boosting its valuation and simplifying its regulatory obligations around the globe.

The insurer has not recommended a specific path forward but will support any initiatives, including a spinoff of its Asian business, that could boost its stock performance or value, the person added. Ping An did not immediately respond to a request for comment on how it planned to vote at the upcoming general meeting.

Banking sector turmoil

HSBC’s leaders were also asked Monfday why the bank had scooped up the British unit of SVB following the stunning collapse of its parent in the United States. The purchase was made for £1 ($1.20) last month, just days after SVB had folded.

Critics have questioned HSBC’s ability to perform adequate due diligence on SVB UK’s customers because of how quickly the deal came together.

“Did HSBC look into the clients of SVB in detail? Say, the financial statement — whether they can pay back the loan?” said Fong.

Quinn and Tucker defended the acquisition, calling it a good business opportunity that allowed the bank to gain hundreds of innovative startups as customers. They pushed back on the notion that management hadn’t had time to carry out proper due diligence.

Tucker also weighed in on recent tumult in the banking industry, saying he did not expect an “immediate impact” on HSBC.

“After the collapse of a number of smaller regional banks and the takeover of Credit Suisse, the share prices of all banks have been suppressed,” he noted.

But he said he did not believe such developments represented “a systemic risk” to the sector. “I do expect a period of uncertainty” before nerves settle, he added.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/business/hsbc-spin-off-hk-shareholder-meeting-intl-hnk/index.html,1

Premarket stocks: CEOs are tired of being held responsible for gun regulation,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.

New York CNN —

Americans have grown used to corporate executives treading the well-worn paths of the Northeast corridor to convene alongside elected officials in Washington, DC, and discuss geopolitics, policy and all that’s in-between.

In 2017, major CEOs from across the country came together to oppose North Carolina’s transgender bathroom law. In 2019, they called abortion bans “bad for business.”

After the deadly attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, many of corporate America’s biggest names denounced the rioters and pledged to halt their political giving.

Recently, more than 1,000 companies promised to voluntarily curtail their operations in Russia in protest of Moscow’s war on Ukraine.

Dick’s Sporting Goods stopped selling semi-automatic, assault-style rifles at stores and Citigroup put new restrictions on gun sales by business customers after the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, in 2018.

A year later, after mass shootings at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, and a nightclub in Dayton, Ohio, Walmart ended handgun ammunition sales.

Corporate leadership has long been vocal on the issue of gun control – in 2019 and again this past summer nearly 150 major companies – including Lululemon, Lyft, Bain Capital, Bloomberg LP, Permanente Medical Group and Unilever – called gun violence a “public health crisis” and demanded that the US Senate pass legislation to address it.

That’s why corporate America’s silence in the wake of the latest mass shooting at a school in Nashville is so jarring. The United States has come to rely on the increasing power of large corporations as political advocates.

But Yale professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a vocal advocate of corporate social responsibility who has a direct line to major CEOs around the globe, said that top executives are forlorn. Their previous efforts haven’t done much to push the needle on gun control legislation and without more backing, they don’t know what else they can do at the moment, he said.

Before the Bell spoke with Sonnenfeld, who runs Yale School of Management’s Chief Executive Leadership Institute, a nonprofit educational and research institute focused on CEO leadership and corporate governance.

This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

Before the Bell: CEOs have been quiet about gun reform since the latest mass school shooting in Nashville, have you heard anything about plans to speak out?

Jeffrey Sonnenfeld: Where is everybody else? Where is all of civil society? CEOs are just one group of people and it’s like we’re turning to them to be our saviors on every topic. They’ve joined causes with valor and nobility but they can’t just be taking cause after cause as if there’s nobody else in society. The social change that happened in the 1960s wasn’t being led primarily by CEOs. Social changes really happened when we saw the interfaith activity of clergy locking arms and canvassing legislators. We saw campuses alive and aroused. Where’s all the student activism?

The CEOs are still the most active even if they’re less active than they were six months ago. They’re not there as hired hands of shareholders to fill the role of politicians and civic leaders. They’re there to join that chorus, but they don’t want to be the only one singing.

So is this what you’re hearing from top CEOs? Have they gotten tired of advocating?

I just got off of a CEO call on voting rights and this morning we had a forum on sustainability – CEOs are still the most active on these fronts. It’s the same thing on immigration reform. If a CEO was working an 18 hour day on a 12 day week, they still couldn’t address all of the issues that need addressing.

The nation’s CEOs are waiting for everybody else to join them. They don’t need to restate something they’ve already stated. They’ve jumped in the pool, where’s everybody else?

So what do you think has led to this complacency amongst Americans and the growing reliance on CEOs to advocate on our behalf?

They’ve taken a very strong stance and they’ve gone out further than the general public. They are where the general public is on surveys, but they’re not where the general public is on action in the streets. So we’re ready for others to now do something. Enough already on saying ‘what are the CEOs doing?’ Social capital is as valuable as financial capital. CEOs understand that in their soul, they want there to be social capital. They want there to be public trust, but they need the rest of civil society to join them. And that’s their frustration.

It sounds like CEOs are frustrated?

Yeah, they’re frustrated.

But don’t these CEOs hold the purse strings in terms of donating to powerful politicians?

You would think that, but since the 2020 elections much less of campaign contributions have come from big business. Since the 2021 run on the Capitol, a lot of businesses either had an official moratorium or they’ve given mere pennies to politicians. The common impression on the street that CEOs are controlling campaign purses strings is 100% wrong.

Tesla sales again fall short of production

By CNN’s Chris Isidore

Tesla reported. a modest 4% rise in sales in the first quarter compared to the final three months of last year, despite a series of price cuts on its lower priced vehicles and talk by CEO Elon Musk about strong demand at those lower prices.

The first quarter also marked the fourth straight quarter that Tesla has produced more vehicles than it has delivered to customers. Some of that may be due to the ramp up in production at two new factories, one in Texas, the other in Germany, which opened last spring, and a lag between that increased production and sales.

Tesla said there was an increase in the number of its more expensive models, the Model S and Model X, in transit to Europe, the Middle East and Africa, as well as to the Asia Pacific region.

But it does mean that over the last 12 months Tesla has produced 78,000 more cars than it has sold, suggesting that talk of strong demand by Tesla executives may not be backed up by the numbers.

“Early this year, we had a price adjustment. After that, we actually generated a huge demand, more than we can produce, really,” said Tom Zhu, Tesla’s executive in charge of global production and sales. “And as Elon said, as long as you offer a product with value at affordable price, you don’t have to worry about demand.”",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html,1

CNN —

Why do we bury our departed loved ones in a cemetery? A primary purpose is to provide survivors with an opportunity to grieve and gain a sense of closure. The cemetery is a place for the living as much as it is a place for the dead.

But what about when the dearly departed are not human – but our pets?

Eric Tourigny Eric Tourigny

The Spanish city of Barcelona recently announced that it will be investing in the establishment of the country’s first public pet cemetery. Set to open next year, it will offer both burials and cremations – with an estimated 7,000 carried out each year.

For me, as someone who has spent years researching the development of pet cemeteries elsewhere in the world, this news came as a shock. Barcelona is a densely populated city with limited privately owned land – one where 50% of families own a pet.

How did a city that is home to 180,000 dogs not already have a public pet cemetery? Until now, the service was only provided by the private sector, according to Barcelona’s Councilor for Climate Emergency and Ecological Transition, Eloi Badia. He added that the municipal-funded initiative was sparked by “constant public demand.”

After all, public pet cemeteries have been around in Europe and the Americas since the late 19th century. Britain’s first public pet cemetery appeared in London’s Hyde Park in 1881. New York’s Hartsdale pet cemetery was founded in 1896, followed a few years later by Paris’ ornate Cimetière des Chiens in 1899.

A grave discovery

I became interested in the history of modern pet burial practices while investigating the archaeological record of a centuries-old house in Toronto. I came across a (very) large dog buried in the back garden which, according to the historical record, was occupied between 1840 and 1870.

This dog survived to an elderly age but, sadly, suffered from degenerative joint disease and severe infections during his last months. His ailments progressed to such a state that suggest he received some level of care in his final weeks. He then was buried in a personal plot behind the family home.

This elderly dog led me to think about the different ways people interact with the bodies of their pets after death. Could this behavior be reflective of the relationships they held with their animals in life? In this instance, why take the time to carefully bury a dog in its own space when other, arguably easier options existed?

""Darling Sammie,"" reads one of the animal gravestones dating back to the 1890s in Hyde Park Pet Cemetery, London. Photo taken by Eric Tourigny with permission from The Royal Parks. Eric Tourigny

This, after all, was an era when people often disposed of their dead pets in the river, or might have sold their bodies for meat and skin.

Good hygiene is an obvious reason to choose a burial – no one wants decomposing animal bodies in the street or their garden – but that wouldn’t immediately warrant a personalized, dedicated burial and gravestone.

The most straight forward option would be to dispose of a deceased animal with the household waste. But such treatment would evidently feel less ceremonious and would not offer appropriate emotional closure to what was likely an important relationship.

A member of the family

Like the burial of people, the burial of pets is an intimate cultural practice, one that changes over time and is reflective of the changing relationships that a society has with its cherished creatures.

My study of historic gravestones and epitaphs in Britain from the Victorian period to today shows this changing human-animal relationship. In the 19th century, gravestones were often dedicated to a “loving friend” or “devoted companion,” suggesting pets were mostly considered important friends.

By the early 20th century, pets had become members of the family – evidenced by the appearance of family surnames on the gravestones, and loving epitaphs written by “Mummy and Daddy.”

By the early 20th century, pets had become members of the family – evidenced by the appearance of family surnames on the gravestones, and loving epitaphs written by “Mummy and Daddy.” Eric Tourigny

Society’s changing attitude towards the role of animals in the afterlife can also be found. Fast-forward a few decades later, and gravestones were more likely to reference a reunion then earlier ones. For example, the owners of Denny, the “brave little cat” buried in an east London cemetery in 1952, wrote on his epitaph “God bless until we meet again.”

I wonder what the epitaphs in Barcelona’s new cemetery will reveal about modern Catalan relationships with animals.

Over time, our ways of treating our animal dead appear to reflect an even closer relationship in life. Once strictly forbidden by law, the last decade saw many jurisdictions, like the state of New York, allowing the co-burial of cremated animals and people, which will undoubtedly lead to changing funerary and commemoration practices for both humans and animals.

Modern mourning

For me, the most remarkable similarity between modern and historic pet cemeteries is the striking evidence for the heartbreak and taboos around grieving for animals.

The connection that someone has with their pet can be just as strong and just as significant as their relationships with other humans. Yet today, as in over 100 years ago, individuals continue to struggle to find the appropriate outlet to express their pain, hiding heartache for fear of the social repercussions that might come with public acknowledgment of the existence of such a bond.

The RSPCA reassures the public on its website that they should not feel shame for their grief. In the UK, charities like the Blue Cross and Rainbow Bridge Pet Loss Grief Center offer counseling to bereaved humans.

Close relationships between people and animals have existed for millennia, but in western European cultures, there were few acceptable ways to mourn that relationship. As society becomes more accepting of the importance of human-animal relationships to our collective wellbeing, it is not surprising to see us follow rituals resembling those we use to mourn the loss of our closest human relationships.

At an estimated cost of €200 ($217) per service at the new Barcelona cemetery, it is important to acknowledge that this opportunity to grieve will not be financially available to everyone in the city.

This will not be a space for all of the city’s pets. Pet owners may opt to keep cremated remains within their home or spread out ashes in a meaningful location instead. Online forums and digital pet cemeteries also provide other opportunities to commemorate the relationship and express grief.

Scientists film deepest ever fish on seabed off Japan,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

Cruising at a depth of 8,336 meters (over 27,000 feet) just above the seabed, a young snailfish has become the deepest fish ever filmed by scientists during a probe into the abyss of the northern Pacific Ocean.

Scientists from University of Western Australia and Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology released footage of the snailfish on Sunday filmed last September by sea robots in deep trenches off Japan.

Along with the filming the deepest snailfish, the scientists physically caught two other specimens at 8,022 meters and set another record for the deepest catch.

Previously, the deepest snailfish ever spotted was at 7,703 meters in 2008, while scientists had never been able to collect fish from anywhere below 8,000 meters.

“What is significant is that it shows how far a particular type of fish will descend in the ocean,” said marine biologist Alan Jamieson, founder of the Minderoo-UWA Deep Sea Research Centre, who led the expedition.

These two fish were caught at a depth of just over 8,000 meters in the Japan Trench in the northern Pacific Ocean. Caladan Oceanic

Scientists are filming in the trenches off Japan as part of a 10-year study into the deepest fish populations in the world. Snailfish are members of Liparidae family, and while most snailfish live in shallow water, others survive at some of the greatest depths ever recorded, Jamieson said.

During the two-month survey last year, three “landers” – automatic sea robots fitted with high-resolution cameras – were dropped into three trenches – the Japan, Izu-Ogasawara and Ryukyu trenches – at varying depths.

In the Izu-Ogasawara trench, footage showed the deepest snailfish hovering calmly alongside other crustaceans on the seabed.

Jamieson classified the fish as a juvenile and said younger deep sea snailfish often stay as deep as possible to avoid being eaten by bigger predators that swim at shallower depths.

Another clip shot at between 7,500 and 8,200 meters in the same trench showed a colony of fish and crustaceans munching at bait tied to an undersea robot.

Images of the two captured snailfish – identified as Pseudoliparis belyaevi – provide a rare glimpse of the unique features that help the deep sea species survive the extreme environment.

They have tiny eyes, a translucent body, and their lack of swim bladder, which helps other fish float, works to their advantage, Jamieson said.

The professor said the Pacific Ocean is particularly conducive to vibrant activity due to its warm southern current, which encourages sea creatures to go deeper, while its abundant marine life provides a good source of food for bottom feeders.

Scientists would like to know more about creatures living at extreme depths, but cost is the constraint, Jamieson said, adding that each lander alone costs them $200,000 to assemble and operate.

“The challenges are that technology has been expensive and scientists don’t have a lot of money,” he said.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/asia/deepest-fish-filmed-off-japan-scn-intl-hnk/index.html,1
What OPEC’s surprise oil cut means for US gas prices,"New York CNN —

OPEC and its allies’ surprise move to slash oil production will soon be felt at US gas pumps.

The group known as OPEC+ announced Sunday it would cut oil production by more than 1.6 million barrels a day starting in May, running through the end of the year. The news sent both Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, and WTI, the US benchmark, up about 6% in trading Monday.

The production cut announcement also had an immediate impact on gasoline futures, which will be passed onto US drivers much more quickly than the spike in oil prices. RBOB, the most closely watched wholesale gasoline price, was up about 8 cents a gallon, or about 3%, in morning trading.

“I think OPEC is reawakening the inflation monster,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS, which tracks gas prices for AAA. “The White House has to be shocked and major-time pissed. It certainly alters the calculus for a while.”

The national average for US gas prices stood at $3.51, on Monday, according to AAA. Kloza said he could see it getting up to $3.80 to $3.90 in relatively short order thanks to the move by OPEC.

“We’re not going to get back to $5 a gallon. I don’t think we’re even going as high as $4,” he said. But he said by the end of the summer US drivers could be back above year-earlier prices, especially if there is a hurricane or other storms affecting production along the Gulf Coast.

The average US regular gas price a year ago stood at $4.19 a gallon in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the disruption that caused to world’s energy markets. Prices eventually reached a record $5.02 a gallon on June 14, before starting a slow but steady decline over the course of more than three months during which the average price fell every day. The decline was partly driven by the release of oil from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and partly by concerns that there could be a US or global recession that reduced the demand for gasoline.

Even at $3.51, US gas prices were just below the $3.53 average on Feb. 23, 2022, the day before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Kloza said one thing keeping prices from getting anywhere near the record levels of 2022 is that the US plans additional releases from the SPR, and US oil production and refining capacity are both up. But a cut of 1 million barrels a day of oil by OPEC+ will not be easy to make up.

“They have ability to cut production and they seem motivated to do so,” he said.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/energy/gas-prices-opec/index.html,1

CNN —

Last year, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia spoke at a white nationalist event organized by Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes that caused Republican leaders to denounce her.

Dean Obeidallah CNN

Last week, Greene’s Twitter account was temporarily suspended by the Elon Musk-headed platform over a tweet with a graphic referring to a “Trans Day of Vengeance,” as she denounced a planned transgender rights rally.

And come Tuesday, Greene has announced plans to protest in New York City when former President Donald Trump is expected to be arraigned on an indictment of more than 30 counts, calling the proceedings against him an “unconstitutional WITCH HUNT!”

But on Sunday, Greene was featured on CBS’ “60 Minutes” in an interview the long-running show promoted on Twitter with the tease: “Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, nicknamed MTG, isn’t afraid to share her opinions, no matter how intense and in-your-face they are. She sits down with Lesley Stahl this Sunday on 60 Minutes.” The images attached to this tweet by “60 Minutes” include Greene and Stahl walking through the US Capitol, taking a stroll outside and Greene showing Stahl something on her phone.

In the segment that aired Sunday night, Stahl noted the congresswoman had moved from the fringe to the GOP’s front row in two years despite a “sharp tongue” and “some pretty radical views” as well as “over the top” comments such as “the Democrats are a party of pedophiles.” Stahl also referred to video of Greene chasing a Parkland, Florida, school shooting survivor, still maintaining that the 2020 election was stolen and failing to criticize Trump over spending. (The interview was conducted before news of his indictment.)

But Stahl didn’t mention Greene spoke at a white nationalist event a year ago while a member of Congress or her extreme anti-Muslim views and her defense of January 6 rioters.

Criticism of CBS for amplifying Greene has been swift and well-deserved even before the program aired. Former GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois tweeted beforehand: “Wow. Insane that 60 min would do this.” (Kinzinger is a CNN senior political commentator.)

Journalist Molly Jong-Fast also slammed “60 Minutes” with the tweet: “Attention is currency and 60 minutes is spending its currency on the Jewish space lasers woman.” (Jong-Fast was apparently referring to Greene’s past claim that a massive California wildfire was started by “a laser” beamed from space controlled by a prominent Jewish banking family.)

David Hogg, who survived the 2018 horrific school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland and has since become an activist against gun violence, responded, “I look forward to your questions about why she thinks school shootings are fake and why she’s supported QAnon.”

Greene amplified the conspiracy theory — two years before being elected to Congress — that the Parkland shooting that took 17 lives was staged. And in 2019, Greene appeared on video confronting Hogg outside the Capitol when he was championing laws to save lives from gun violence, screaming that the then-teenager was a “coward.” She also called Hogg “#littleHitler” on social media.

Greene’s own tweet promoting Sunday’s segment was not filled with her typical smears of “fake news” when she doesn’t like the coverage. Rather, Greene urged people to tune in as she praised “60 Minutes” host Stahl (and misspelled her first name): “It was an honor to spend a few days with the legendary icon Leslie Stahl and talented crew @60Minutes.” Greene added, “Leslie is a trailblazer for women in journalism. And while we may disagree on some issues, I respect her greatly.”

Now, it is true that “60 Minutes” over its 50-plus-year history has featured what the show has dubbed “controversial” guests. These include a 2000 interview with Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, whose 1995 terrorist attack left 168 dead, including 19 children. And the show did a 1979 interview with Iran’s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.

Perhaps “60 Minutes” views Greene — who has repeatedly downplayed and even defended the January 6, 2021, attack plus called for the GOP to become the party of “Christian nationalism” — in the vein of its long list of controversial guests. (CBS had not responded to a request from CNN for comment at time of publishing.)

However, the choice of Greene as a guest instantly recalls the comments of then-CBS CEO Les Moonves during Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign when he admitted that Trump’s candidacy “may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS.” Moonves added, “The money’s rolling in and this is fun. … (T)his is going to be a very good year for us,” concluding, “Sorry. It’s a terrible thing to say. But bring it on, Donald. Keep going.”

Moonves may be gone from CBS, but it appears his mindset continues at “60 Minutes.” And that may be good for “60 Minutes,” but it’s definitely not good for America.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/opinions/60-minutes-marjorie-taylor-greene-interview-obeidallah/index.html,1
‘The New Big 5’: Wildlife photography book turns the lens on animals at risk,"Editor’s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex’s Perpetual Planet initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.

CNN —

Originally a term used by trophy hunters in Africa, the “Big Five” described the animals most challenging to shoot and kill: the lion, elephant, leopard, rhino, and buffalo. Nowadays, it is more loosely used to refer to some of Africa’s largest and most iconic animals.

However, British photographer Graeme Green has reclaimed the narrative, creating a global “New Big Five” for wildlife photography. In 2021, 50,000 people around the world voted for the five animals they would most like to photograph, or see photographed, in the wild. Five animals were crowned the winners: the elephant, polar bear, lion, gorilla and tiger.

This week, sees the publication of “The New Big 5” photography book, which features images of those animals and other at-risk wildlife, from photography legends such as Ami Vitale, Steve McCurry and Paul Nicklen, and essays from famous conservationists and activists including like Jane Goodall and Paula Kahumbu.

Green says that the book celebrates wildlife and is a global call to action on issues impacting wildlife, including habitat loss, poaching, pollution and climate change.

Animals at risk

Green was on assignment in Botswana at least a decade ago when he came up with the idea for a project to encourage people to “shoot with a camera, not a gun,” he says.

“I thought this would be a way to get people really focusing on wildlife, thinking about the wildlife they love, thinking about the animals that are at risk.”

In total, the book includes the work of 144 globally renowned wildlife photographers from Ecuador to India. Curating the images took nearly two years of work, says Green.

“I think these are some of the most beautiful and creative images that I’ve seen put together in one book,” says Green. “These are the species that we are at risk of losing.”

According to the UN, nature is declining at an unprecedented rate, with around one million of the planet’s animal and plant species facing extinction. The “New Big 5,” all of which are threatened, act as ambassadors for what is happening in the natural world, says Green.

As well as being a powerful reminder of what we stand to lose, the book also points people towards potential solutions. Featured essays explore the benefits of rewilding and the importance of indigenous communities in conservation.

A chapter on endangered species from bees to blue whales illustrates the alarming threat climate change poses to animals outside of the “New Big 5.” “That’s only the tip of the iceberg – I could have included thousands of pictures because that’s how serious the situation is,” says Green.

""In Indian forests, it's very difficult to get a proper picture of a running tiger, as they all are thick forests. I kept the camera settings fast enough to freeze the running tiger,"" said photographer Thomas Vijayan in a press release. Thomas Vijayan/The New Big 5

Jane Goodall, a leading conservationist who also wrote the afterword to the book, said in a press release that “we have a window of time during which we can start to heal some of the harm we have inflicted on the natural world, but only if we get together and take action now.

“I hope the photos will lead people into the wonderful worlds of these iconic species. Then, perhaps, other people will become involved in helping to create a world where wildlife can flourish for future generations to enjoy,” she said.

"Syrian refugee elected mayor of German town, years after fleeing war","CNN —

A Syrian who arrived in Germany as a refugee in 2015 has won a mayoral election in the southwestern German state of Baden-Württemberg.

Ryyan Alshebl, who left his hometown of As Suwayda in Syria eight years ago, ran as an independent in the municipality of Ostelsheim. He won 55.41% of the votes on Sunday, beating two German candidates, Marco Strauss and Mathias Fey.

Locals cheered the 29-year-old when he welcomed his win, a victory he described as “sensational,” German local broadcaster SWR reported Monday.

“Today, Ostelsheim sent an example for broad-mindedness and cosmopolitanism for the whole of Germany,” he said, according to to German public broadcaster ZDF. “That’s not something that can be taken for granted in a conservative, rural area.”

Alshebl’s first call after his victory was to his mother in Syria, who was thrilled with the news, SWR reported.

The Association of Municipalities of Baden-Württemberg said Alshebl is the first man with Syrian roots to run for and win a mayor’s office. He will start his role in June.

Ostelsheim residents have welcomed their incoming mayor. “The fairy tale has come true, and the right man has become our mayor,” Annette Keck, who lives in the village, told SWR.

Strauss, one of his opponents, congratulated Alshebl. “I wish you good luck and at the same time ask for support for Mr. Alshebl, for our shared Ostelsheim,” he said on Facebook.

The state’s Integration Minister Manne Lucha said that Alshebl’s victory showed that diversity is a natural part of Baden-Württemberg. “I would be very pleased if Ryyan Alshebl’s election encourages more people with a migration history to run for political office,” he said.

Not everyone has been so warm to the 29-year-old. ZDF reported the Syrian received hateful comments on the campaign trail.

The young politician went from house to house, promoting his election program, and “the experiences were predominantly positive,” but there was also a minority of far-right fringe voters in Ostelsheim that did not want to accept him due to his Syrian roots, Alshebl told ZDF.

‘Investing in your future’

Born to a schoolteacher and agricultural engineer in Syria, Alshebl described his life as carefree until the age of 20, according to his campaign website.

At the time, protests against the Syrian government that began in 2011 soon devolved into chaotic war. The fighting and later rise of ISIS forced 10.6 million people from home by late 2015 – about half of Syria’s pre-war population.

Alshebl faced the dilemma of being drafted for military service with the Syrian army or leaving the country, according to his website.

While many Syrians were displaced internally or fled to countries in the region, others like Alshebl made the dangerous journey to Europe. He was 21 years old at the time, and said he crossed from Turkey to the Greek island of Lesbos in a rubber dinghy.

Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel had implemented a brief open-door policy in 2015 that saw the country take in about 1.2 million asylum seekers in the following years, including Alshebl.

The move sparked a backlash in Germany and the sudden growth of the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) in the wake of summer 2015.

Once in Germany, Alshebl lived close to Ostelsheim and said at the time he felt “there is only one thing you can do: get back on your feet quickly and start investing in your own future quickly.”

For the last seven years he worked in the administration of Althengstett town hall, in a neighboring town. He drew from his experience, he said in his campaign, and made digital access to to public administration services one of priorities. Flexible childcare and climate protections are also on his agenda.

Alshebl, who is a member of the Green Party and now has German citizenship, pledged during his campaign that once elected as mayor he would move to Ostelsheim.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/04/europe/germany-mayor-syrian-refugee-intl/index.html,1
"Autism: Study finds slightly higher risk of diagnosis in areas with more lithium in drinking water, but experts say more research is needed","CNN —

A new study found a moderately higher risk of autism spectrum disorder in children born to pregnant people exposed to tap water with higher levels of lithium, but experts caution that this association does not show a direct link between the two.

About 1 in 36 children in the US is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) each year, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Scientists still don’t know the exact cause of autism, a developmental disorder. Genetics may be a factor, but some have been looking at potential environmental causes, too.

Cases may be on the rise, but that is also unclear. One study published this year on cases in the New York-New Jersey area found that autism diagnosis rates tripled among certain age groups between 2000 and 2016. A 2021 report found similar increases in cases, but the CDC says the increased number of cases is most likely linked to more doctors screening for the condition.

Lithium is an alkali metal that can be found naturally in some food and ground water. It’s used in batteries, grease and air conditioners, as well as in the treatment of bipolar disorder and some blood disorders. Its levels in US drinking water are not regulated, according to the US Geological Survey.

A new study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, found a small association between lithium and autism diagnosis in Denmark, where the researchers say the level of lithium in drinking water is similar to that in American water systems.

The researchers checked a database of people with psychiatric disorders for children born between 2000 and 2013 to find information on 8,842 cases of ASD and 43,864 participants who did not have ASD. They then measured the concentration of lithium in 151 public waterworks that served more than half of the Danish population and mapped out where pregnant people lived in relation.

As lithium levels in water increased, there was a modest increased risk of an ASD diagnosis. Specifically, compared with people at the lowest exposure level, those who had the second and third highest exposure during pregnancy had a 24% to 26% higher risk of ASD diagnosed in children. The group with the highest exposure had a 46% higher risk than those at the lowest level of exposure.

The researchers could not tell how much water the pregnant people drank, but they picked Denmark in part because residents there consume some of the lowest amounts of bottled water in Europe.

Experts say it’s important to note that the research can’t show that lithium exposure leads directly to an autism diagnosis.

Further study is required, said study co-author Dr. Beate Ritz, a professor of neurology in the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, and a professor of epidemiology and environmental health at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.

“Any drinking water contaminants that may affect the developing human brain deserve intense scrutiny,” Ritz said in a news release. She added that the research would need to be replicated in other countries to look for a similar connection.

The implications of the findings are complex as far as public health policy is concerned, according to an editorial published alongside the study. Lithium levels in water, at concentrations that the study associated with a potential ASD risk, have also been linked with health benefits such as lower rates of hospitalization for psychiatric disorders and suicide.

“If all these of associations are valid, the wisdom of Solomon will be required to develop guidelines for lithium in drinking water that are maximally protective of the entire population,” wrote Dr. David C. Bellinger, a professor of neurology and psychology at Harvard Medical School. “Until the basic biology of ASD is better understood, it will be difficult to distinguish causal from spurious associations.”

Dr. Max Wiznitzer, director of the Rainbow Autism Center at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, points to other research on the effects of lithium on pregnant people who take it for mental health disorders. Those studies – which look at people exposed to much higher levels than are found in drinking water – do not show a connection with autism spectrum disorder.

“It’s an interesting association, but causation is definitely not proven,” said Wiznitzer, who was not involved in the new research. “We have to see if there’s a viable and biologically plausible mechanism by which a small amount of lithium in the water supply can somehow do this, yet pharmacologic dosing of lithium in women with bipolar disorder has not been reported to be causing increased risk of ASD.”

Other studies have also suggested connections between ASD and environmental exposures to things like pesticides, air pollution and phthalates. But none of them points to any of these factors as a direct cause of the disorder.

A link between environmental exposure and ASD is hard to prove, Wiznitzer said. With research showing that increased exposure to air pollution raises the risk of giving birth to a child with ASD, for example, he often wonders whether pollution is the determining factor or if it’s just the populations who live in more polluted areas.

“There’s a lot of speculation about about environmental factors, but how many of them are truly causally associated?” Wiznitzer said. “We are bombarded with a variety of environmental stressors in our everyday lives. We have to figure out how to basically safely navigate them, and this is probably not one that’s high on our list.”",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/health/autism-lithium-study/index.html,1
"Kwame Brathwaite, photographer of ‘Black is Beautiful’ movement, dies at 85","Editor’s Note: This article was originally published by The Art Newspaper, an editorial partner of CNN Style.

CNN —

Kwame Brathwaite, the pioneering activist and photographer whose work helped define the aesthetics of the “Black is Beautiful” movement of the 1960s and beyond, died on April 1, aged 85.

His son, Kwame Brathwaite, Jr, announced his father’s death in an Instagram post that read in part, “I am deeply saddened to share that my Baba, the patriarch of our family, our rock and my hero has transitioned.”

Brathwaite’s work has been the subject of resurgent interest from curators, historians and collectors in recent years, and his first major institutional retrospective, which was organized by the Aperture Foundation, made its debut in 2019 at the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles before touring the country.

Kwame Brathwaite Cory Rice

Brathwaite was born in 1938 to Barbadian immigrants, in what he referred to as “the People’s Republic of Brooklyn” in New York, though his family moved from there to Harlem and then to the South Bronx when Brathwaite was 5 years old. He attended the School of Industrial Art (now the High School of Art and Design) and, according to profiles of Brathwaite in T Magazine and Vice, was drawn to photography by two moments. The first was in August of 1955, when a 17-year-old Brathwaite encountered David Jackson’s haunting photograph of a brutalized Emmett Till in his open casket. The second was in 1956, when — after he and his brother Elombe co-founded the African Jazz Arts Society and Studios (AJASS) — Brathwaite saw a young man taking photos in a dark jazz club without the use of a flash, and his mind became alight with possibility.

Using a Hasselblad medium-format camera, Brathwaite attempted to do the same, learning to work with limited light in a manner that enhanced the visual narrative of his imagery. He would soon also develop a darkroom technique that enriched and deepened how Black skin would appear in his photography, honing the practice in a small darkroom in his Harlem apartment. Brathwaite went on to photograph jazz legends performing throughout the 1950s and ’60s, including Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk and others.

“You want to get the feeling, the mood that you’re experiencing when they’re playing,” Brathwaite told Aperture Magazine in 2017. “That’s the thing. You want to capture that.”

By the early 1960s, alongside the rest of AJASS, Brathwaite began using his photography and organizing prowess to consciously push back against whitewashed, Eurocentric beauty standards. The group came up with the concept of the Grandassa Models, young Black women whom Brathwaite would photograph, celebrating and accentuating their features. In 1962, AJASS organized “Naturally ’62”, a fashion show held in a Harlem club called the Purple Manor and featuring the models. The show would go on to be held regularly until 1992. In 1966, Brathwaite married his wife Sikolo, a Grandassa Model whom he had met on the street the year prior when he asked if he could take her portrait. The two remained married for the rest of Brathwaite’s life.

By the 1970s, Brathwaite’s focus on jazz shifted to other forms of popular Black music. In 1974, he traveled to Africa with the Jackson Five to document their tour, also photographing the historic “Rumble in the Jungle” boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in what’s now the Democratic Republic of Congo that same year. Commissions in this era also saw Brathwaite photographing Nina Simone, Stevie Wonder, Sly and the Family Stone, Bob Marley and other music legends.

Throughout the ensuing decades, Brathwaite continued to explore and develop his mode of photography, all through the lens of the “Black is Beautiful” ethos. In 2016, Brathwaite joined the roster of Philip Martin Gallery in Los Angeles, and he was continuing to photograph commissions as recently as 2018, when he shot artist and stylist Joanne Petit-Frère for The New Yorker.

T Magazine’s 2021 profile, published on the occasion of Brathwaite’s retrospective traveling to the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Texas, noted that the photographer’s health was failing such that he was unable to be interviewed for the article. A separate exhibition, “Kwame Brathwaite: Things Well Worth Waiting For,” is currently on view at the Art Institute of Chicago, where it will remain until July 24.

Inside haggis: The secrets of Scotland’s national dish,"CNN —

Anthony Bourdain loved haggis. But even the late, great American chef, writer and television host recognized that Scotland’s national dish, with its “sinister sheep parts” wrapped in a shroud of mystery and half-invented history, could be a hard sell.

“Don’t let them tell you otherwise, that’s really one of life’s great pleasures,” Bourdain said on one of his gastro-curious pilgrimages to Glasgow. “There is no more unfairly reviled food on Earth than the haggis.”

A mash-up of diced lung, liver and heart mixed with oatmeal, beef suet, onion and assorted spices, haggis was traditionally made by stuffing these raw ingredients into the stomach of a recently slain sheep and boiling the lot to a state of palatability.

Instagrammable is not the word that immediately comes to mind. In our 21st-century world, where “clean” eating and processed pap overlap, haggis can seem like an “Outlander”-style outlier from another age.

Yet, by some alchemy, once cooked to its required “warm-reekin’ (steaming)” state, it adds up to much more than the sum of its modest parts. It’s offaly charm has kept nose-to-tail eating alive among a younger generation of Scots that has largely turned its back on the tripe, liver and kidneys their predecessors enjoyed (or endured).

Carefully prepared, haggis tastes both oaty and meaty; it is dark and crumbly, a little crispy at the edges but still moist; earthy but also savory and spicy; deep-tasting and profoundly warming, the perfect foil for its traditional garnish of floury mashed potatoes and orange bashed turnip.

“It’s like a cuddle for the stomach,” says Nicola Turner, a 35-year-old office administrator from Helensburgh, a town on western Scotland’s Firth of Clyde.

Spice and texture

For children of the 1960s and ’70s, like crime novelist Ian Rankin, haggis meals were a choice between the classic meat-and-two-veg plate and the battered and deep-fried, chip-shop iteration loved by both his friend Bourdain and his quintessentially Scottish detective character, Inspector John Rebus.

Now myriad other treatments have blossomed.

“I’m pretty sure the first time I dined with AB in Edinburgh we had haggis in filo pastry with a jam-style – maybe blackcurrant – sauce,” Rankin recalled. “He was a big fan of haggis and of chip shops. Rebus will have enjoyed the occasional haggis supper from his local chip shop. He was definitely a fan, as am I.”

“It is all about the spicing and the texture,” says the Scottish food writer, novelist and cook Sue Lawrence, a champion of haggis’ adaptability for use in other dishes. “If you didn’t know what was in it, you wouldn’t think ‘oh that tastes of liver or whatever.’ It is all nicely chopped up and the oatmeal gives it a lovely texture. It could easily be a nice, big mince dish.”

Lawrence uses haggis as an alternative to beef and pork ragù in lasagna and in her pastilla, a version of the North African dish in which a hand-made haggis from the Isle of Mull substitutes for the traditional poultry or seafood filling. The filo pastry savory is flavored with the spice blend ras el hanout, apricots, chile, orange zest and almonds before being sprinkled with cinnamon and icing sugar.

Such cultural crossovers serve as a reminder that haggis could easily be a dish with nothing specifically Scottish about it at all. Records of similar quick and portable preparations of the fast-perishing innards of sheep and other animals date back to ancient Rome and Greece.

Haggis-like combinations of offal and grains are part of the culinary history of several countries. Spain has chireta, Romania drob and Sweden polsa, while chaudin, or ponce, is a rice and meat-stuffed pig stomach that is a staple of Cajun cooking.

In neighboring England, recipes for “hagese,” “hagws of a schepe,” “haggas” or “haggus” pop up in recipe books published between the 15th and 17th centuries, probably preceding written records north of the border.

Etymological evidence points to the term “haggis” having its roots in Old Norse, suggesting an early version of an oat-and-offal sausage might have arrived in Britain and Ireland on a Viking longboat.

But ever since it was first optioned by the poet Robert Burns in the late 1700s, the haggis backstory has been monopolized by Scotland and the Scots, sometimes mischievously.

It is, according to the kind of lore that Burns engendered, the dish a doughty Highlander would carry with him as he drove cattle through the glens to the markets of the central belt or the perfect picnic for a whisky smuggler plying his illicit trade by moonlight.

From such romantic notions it was a short step to turning the haggis into a wee wild beastie, one with longer legs on one side that was thus condemned to run round and round whichever hill it lived on. In 2003, a poll of American tourists in Scotland found that one in three of them believed they might encounter such a confused creature on a Caledonian vacation.

Bourdain, a native New Yorker, may have qualified as haggis’ biggest admirer since Burns, but his compatriots at the US Department of Agriculture remain unconverted to offal-filled paunch. Haggis imports into the United States were prohibited in 1971 as part of a ban on the consumption of all livestock lungs. Authentic versions of old school haggis remain culinary contraband in the US, as hard to lay your hands on as Cuban cigars.

Across the rest of the world, it’s a different story. According to leading producer Simon Howie, haggis is more widely appreciated and consumed now than it has been since Burns improvised his “Address to a Haggis” for the entertainment of well-to-do Edinburgh acquaintances.

Pudding chieftan

Firmly tongue-in-cheek, the poem lauds the “Great chieftain o’ the pudding race,” as exactly the kind of unpretentious, hearty fare required to nourish a nation of braveheart warriors.

In comparison to the enfeebling foreign muck enjoyed by the capital’s claret-quaffing elites of the time – the olio, fricassée or ragoût that would “sicken a sow” – Burns urges his readers to wonder at the magical impact of haggis on his fellow sons of Scotland’s soil.

As the English translation of the original Scots language version puts it:

But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed/

The trembling earth resounds his tread/

Clap in his ample fist a blade/

He’ll make it whistle/

And legs and arms and heads will cut/

Off like the heads of thistles

These days synthetic casings have largely replaced stomach but ovine and porcine innards remain at the core of most of the haggis produced in its homeland, said Howie, who estimates that his company Simon Howie Butchers, accounts for around 60% of the roughly two million haggises produced every year.

For Howie, versatility, value for money and convenience explain why this staple of the Scottish larder is thriving. Typically haggis retails in Scotland, which accounts for half of global consumption by volume, for around £6, or $7.70 per kilogram ($3.36/pound). That’s around half the price of less expensive cuts of beef or a third of the price of Scotch lamb while enjoying a fairly similar nutritional and calorific profile.

“You can give your kids a meal that is not full of things you don’t want to feed them – for a few pounds you can feed three strapping lads,” Howie said.

“From a kitchen perspective, it is very simple because when it leaves our factory it is already cooked. So when you or a restaurant owner gets it into the kitchen all you have to do is heat it up to be piping hot. It couldn’t be more basic: a student with no cooking skills or a Michelin-starred chef do exactly the same thing to put it out on the plate.”

Haggis pakora

Its texture means haggis can also be usefully deployed in fine dining alongside leaner meat like venison or as a stuffing for poultry and game birds. Its spicy intensity means it is also finding uses in canapés and as a crouton-borne garnish for soups.

Buoyant sales are also underpinned by the increasing consumption of haggis in forms inspired by Scotland’s ethnic minorities.

Glasgow’s Sikh community pioneered haggis pakora in the 1990s and samosas, spring rolls and quesadillas have followed in its wake, often using a vegetarian version of the protein in which the offal is replaced by a mix of vegetables, pulses and mushrooms.

Such dishes are more than culinary twists. They are badges of belonging, and an indication that, two centuries after Burns grabbed it for the nation, haggis is as intimately entwined with Scots identity as ever.

Just ask Ross O’Cinneide, a promising 14-year-old fly-half in the junior section of Stirling County rugby club.

“Most of my friends and I like haggis,” he says. “Mum makes it for us sometimes after rugby and it’s got a very nice warming feeling. And it’s nice because it’s purely Scottish.”",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/haggis-scotland-secrets/index.html,1
Elon Musk’s Twitter promised a purge of blue check marks. Instead he singled out one account,"New York CNN —

Some VIP Twitter users woke up on Saturday expecting to have lost their coveted blue verification check marks in a previously announced purge by Elon Musk. Instead, Twitter appeared to target a single account from a major publication Musk dislikes and changed the language on its site in a way that obscures why users are verified.

Twitter had said it would “begin winding down” blue checks granted under its old verification system — which emphasized protecting high-profile users at risk of impersonation — on April 1. In order to stay verified, Musk said, users would have to pay $8 per month to join the platform’s Twitter Blue subscription service, which has allowed accounts to pay for verification since December.

Most legacy blue check holders found this weekend that their verification marks had not disappeared, but rather had been appended with a new label reading: “This account is verified because it’s subscribed to Twitter Blue or is a legacy verified account.” The language, which shows up when users click on the check mark, makes it unclear whether verified accounts are actually notable individuals or simply users who have paid to join Twitter Blue.

But one high-profile account did lose its blue check over the weekend: the main account for the New York Times, which had previously told CNN it would not pay for verification.

After an account that often engages with Musk posted a meme this weekend about the Times declining to pay for verification, Musk responded in a tweet saying, “Oh ok, we’ll take it off then.” Musk then lashed out at the Times — just the latest instance of the billionaire slamming journalists or media outlets — in a series of tweets that claimed the outlet’s coverage is boring and “propaganda.”

The weekend moves are just the latest example of Twitter creating confusion and whiplash for users over feature changes — and in this case, not just any users, but many of the most high-profile accounts that have long been a key selling point for the platform. It also highlights how Musk often appears to guide decisions about the platform more by whims than by policy.

Although the New York Times’ main account lost its blue check, its other accounts, such as those for its arts, travel and books content, remained verified. (It’s not clear why the New York Times doesn’t have a gold “organizations” check mark, like accounts for other news outlets, including the Associated Press and the Washington Post.) After its blue check was removed, a spokesperson for the New York Times reiterated to CNN that it does not plan to pay for verification.

Twitter, which laid off most of its public relations staff last fall, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In a separate puzzling move, Twitter’s blue bird logo at the top of the site was replaced on Monday with doge, the meme representing the cryptocurrency dogecoin, which Musk has promoted. The price of dogecoin shot up 20% on Monday.

Musk’s long campaign against “legacy” blue checks

Musk has been threatening to take away “legacy” blue check marks from users verified under Twitter’s old system since shortly after he bought Twitter last fall.

In early November, Twitter launched the option for people paying for its Twitter Blue subscription service to receive blue checks. The program was quickly put on pause after being plagued by a wave of celebrity and corporate impersonators, and was relaunched in December.

Twitter also rolled out a color-coded verification system with differently colored marks for companies and government entities, but Musk continued to say that individual users would eventually have to pay for blue checks.

In the days leading up to the blue check purge that wasn’t, prominent users such as actor William Shatner and anti-bullying activist Monica Lewinksy pushed back against the idea that, as power users that draw attention to the site, they should have to pay for a feature that keeps them safe from impersonation.

By muddying the reason accounts are verified, the new label could risk making it easier for people to scam or impersonate high-profile users. Experts in inauthentic behavior have also said it’s not clear that reserving verification for paid users will reduce the number of bots on the site, an issue Musk has raised on and off over the past year.

Musk, for his part, has previously presented changes to Twitter’s verification system as a way of “treating everyone equally.”

“There shouldn’t be a different standard for celebrities,” he said in a tweet last week. The paid feature could also drive revenue, which could help Musk, who is on the hook for significant debt after buying Twitter for $44 billion.

Musk last week also said that starting on April 15, only verified accounts would be recommended in users’ “For You” feeds alongside the accounts they follow.

Emma Heming Willis shares family photos as daughter Mabel turns 11,"CNN —

Bruce Willis’ wife, Emma Heming Willis, has celebrated their elder daughter’s birthday with a trip down memory lane.

Mabel Willis turned 11 on Sunday, and her proud mom marked the occasion by sharing a montage of family photos and videos taken over the years, set to the song “Pictures Of You” by The Cure.

“Happy 11th Birthday Mabel Ray!” Heming Willis wrote in the caption.

“Your energy is infectious,” she continued, praising her little girl for the way she “can light a whole room with your smile and warmth.”

“How you love and care for your family and friends is beautiful to witness. Keep shining my love and always remember to #liveitup,” Heming Willis added.

Heming Willis and Willis married in 2009. Along with Mabel, the couple also have an 8-year-old daughter, Evelyn. Willis also has daughters Rumer, Scout and Tallulah with his ex-wife, Demi Moore.

Willis is clearly a doting dad. One picture in Heming Willis’ montage shows the “Die Hard” star holding baby Mabel while planting a kiss on her forehead, while a more recent image shows a beaming Willis hanging out in nature with his preteen.

Heming Willis penned an equally heartfelt tribute last month when her husband celebrated his 68th birthday. Sharing a video montage on Instagram, she referred to the actor as “pure love.”

In February, Willis’ family announced that his speaking disorder, aphasia, had progressed into a form of dementia called frontotemporal dementia, or FTD.

“Today there are no treatments for the disease, a reality that we hope can change in the years ahead,” they said in an update shared online. “As Bruce’s condition advances, we hope that any media attention can be focused on shining a light on this disease that needs far more awareness and research.”

According to the Alzheimer’s Association, FTD refers to “a group of disorders caused by progressive nerve cell loss in the brain’s frontal lobes (the areas behind your forehead) or its temporal lobes.” These areas of the brain are generally associated with personality, behavior and language.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/entertainment/emma-willis-mabel-birthday-photos-intl-scli/index.html,1
Lionel Messi: Some fans whistle as Messi’s name is announced as Paris Saint-Germain’s season hits new low,"CNN —

Paris Saint-Germain’s miserable season went from bad to worse on Sunday as the team suffered a second straight home defeat with a 1-0 loss to Lyon.

Even before the game kicked off, Lionel Messi bore the brunt of the frustrations of some PSG fans who whistled when his name appeared on the big screen during the announcement of the starting lineup.

After Alexadre Lacazette missed a first-half penalty, Bradley Barcola’s goal 10 minutes into the second period was enough to earn Lyon the three points on a night that PSG rarely looked like threatening the visiting goal.

Lens’ 1-0 victory over Rennes and Marseille’s 1-1 draw with Montepellier means both teams are now just six points behind PSG at the top of Ligue 1, and even the domestic title may slip from the team’s grasp.

The reaction of some fans on Sunday must have felt a world away from the adulation and worship Messi received during his recent return to Argentina for friendlies against Panama and Curaçao as the country continued its World Cup celebrations.

Messi’s arrival at the Parc des Princes was supposed to be the missing piece that would help PSG finally win the Champions League, the trophy the club’s Qatari owners crave the most.

So far, the only major trophy the team has won since Messi joined was Ligue 1 last season, a title – it’s fair to say – PSG would likely have won without him.

Messi has 34 goal contributions in all competitions for PSG this season – 18 goals and 17 assists – second only to Mbappé’s 38 and head coach Christophe Galtier refused to lay the blame for the team’s failures at the Argentine’s feet.

“I found it [the jeering] hard to listen to,” Galtier told reporters, per the Athletic. “There may be expectations for Messi and Mbappe to unlock difficult situations. Messi tries very hard, they didn’t all work out; but around him, the other players also need to do their jobs.”

“We can’t expect everything from Leo and Kylian,” he added.

Up next for PSG is a season-defining week as Galtier’s side travels to a Nice team that is unbeaten in 13 matches, before hosting Lens at the Parc des Princes.

PSG has lost two of its three matches since being dumped out of the Champions League by Bayern Munich last month, and only limped past relegation-threatened Brest with a 90th minute Kylian Mbappé winner.

After his team’s victory, Lyon head coach Laurent Blanc said the Champions League or bust mentality has been detrimental to PSG’s performances.

“Paris’ problem is when the No. 1 objective of the Champions League is no longer accessible, it seems that the season no longer exists – and at all levels,” he told reporters.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/football/lionel-messi-psg-whistles-fans-spt-intl/index.html,1
Graham Potter: Premier League breaks record for most sackings in a single season,"CNN —

It was just six months ago that Graham Potter was deemed the man to usher in a fresh, exciting era at Chelsea.

The club’s new ownership group, led by American businessman Todd Boehly, had enticed Potter away from Brighton with the promise of managing one of the most lucrative teams in world soccer.

More than $600 million was spent on bringing big-name players to the club and Potter, one of the most exciting young managers in the Premier League, was to mold them into a winning machine.

But, on Sunday, the club announced that it had sacked its manager after an underwhelming spell in charge.

Potter managed to win just 10 of the 28 league matches this season and leaves the team 11th in the Premier League table.

In recent weeks, players had looked a shadow of their former selves and many fans had lost confidence that Potter’s plan for the club could ever work.

Eventually, after previously sticking by its manager, Blues ownership agreed.

“On behalf of everyone at the club, we want to thank Graham sincerely for his contribution to Chelsea,” the club’s co-owners Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali said in a statement.

“We have the highest degree of respect for Graham as a coach and as a person. He has always conducted himself with professionalism and integrity and we are all disappointed in this outcome.”

In his previous role as Brighton manager, Potter was given time to stamp his identity on the squad.

The club was punching above its weight financially and, as a result, carefully selected new signings which would compliment Potter’s style of play.

The approach paid off as the team became an established Premier League outfit which has gone on to greater things this season – the Seagulls currently sit sixth in the league and in the UEFA Conference League qualification spot.

At Chelsea, it seemed the complete opposite.

As was the case under previous owner Roman Abramovich, the club expected instant results and used its financial weight to sign a number of high-profile names, including the likes of Enzo Fernández and Mykhailo Mudryk.

Despite his impressive CV, Potter had never managed superstars and suddenly found himself in a changing room with multiple.

The scatter gun approach to recruitment also left the team lacking balance and organization with Potter failing to get a tune out of a team busting with talent.

Premier League record

In truth, many had raised an eyebrow when Potter, inexperienced at the very top level, was chosen to replace Thomas Tuchel as manager.

Despite falling out of favor with fans by the end of his tenure, Tuchel had guided Chelsea to the Champions League title in 2021 and is still considered by many as one of the best coaches in the world.

The German has gone on to sign with Bavarian giant Bayern Munich through the 2024/25 season and recently told reporters he needed “quite a bit of time to distance himself from Chelsea” because leaving the club had hurt him.

“Todd [Boehly] said he would be different to Roman [Abramovich],” former Liverpool player and current pundit Jamie Carragher wrote on Twitter.

“I feel for Graham Potter, but it was inevitable. You don’t change Tuchel for Potter. Ridiculous decision to start with.”

With 10 games left in the league and a Champions League quarterfinal against Real Madrid on the horizon, Chelsea still has plenty to play for.

Assistant coach Bruno Saltor will take over on an interim basis, but Boehly and his team must now look for a long-term replacement capable – and willing – to bring order to Chelsea’s chaos.

Potter’s sacking is yet another sign of just how transient managers can be in the top-flight of English football, especially when results aren’t instantaneous.

There has now been a record 12 sackings in the Premier League so far this season, with Potter leaving his position the same day Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers was sacked from his.

The previous record was 10 manager changes in a single season, set in four other campaigns, most recently in 2017/18.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/football/chelsea-graham-potter-manager-premier-league-spt-intl/index.html,1

Angel Reese defends gesture directed towards Caitlin Clark after LSU national title win; calls out double standard after being ‘unapologetically’ her,"CNN —

LSU star Angel Reese defended the gesture she aimed at Iowa Hawkeyes’ Caitlin Clark near the end of the Tigers’ first NCAA women’s basketball national championship victory on Sunday, saying “I don’t take disrespect lightly.”

Reese could be seen approaching Clark before moving her open hand in front of her face – popularized by WWE star John Cena to mean “you can’t see me” – before pointing to her ring finger in a gesture some interpreted as a reference to the place her newly-acquired championship ring might sit.

Clark made a similar gesture to another player earlier in the tournament.

The gesture has sparked much debate, especially on social media. Some have criticized Reese, while others have defended her actions, highlighting how there was no public outrage in response to Clark’s gesture earlier in the tournament.

Sports journalist Jose de Jesus Ortiz called Reese’s actions “classless,” while former ESPN host Keith Olbermann called Reese an “idiot” for the gesture.

In the press conference after the victory, Reese referenced the difference in reaction she received as a result of her gesture as compared to the one Clark received.

“All year, I was critiqued for who I was. I don’t fit the narrative,” Reese said. “I don’t fit the box that y’all want me to be in. I’m too hood. I’m too ghetto. Y’all told me that all year. But when other people do it, and y’all don’t say nothing.

“So this is for the girls that look like me. For those that want to speak up for what they believe in. It’s unapologetically you. And that’s what I did it for tonight. It was bigger than me tonight. And Twitter is going to go into a rage every time.

“And I’m happy. I feel like I’ve helped grow women’s basketball this year. (…) I’m looking forward to celebrating and then next season.”

Reese had 15 points and 10 rebounds in the 102-85 victory and won the women’s March Madness’ Most Outstanding Player award.

In the post-game broadcast, Reese referenced the similar gesture Clark made to a Louisville opponent in the Elite Eight.

In the same game, Clark said to an opponent: “You’re down by 15 points. Shut up,” according to the Bleacher Report.

“Caitlin Clark is a hell of a player but I don’t take disrespect lightly,” Reese said. “She disrespected [LSU’s] Alexis [Morris] (…) and I wanted to pick her pocket. But I had a moment at the end of her game. I was in my bag, I was in my moment.”

After the Championship game, Clark herself said she didn’t notice anything at the time.

“I was just trying to get to the handshake line and shake hands and be grateful that my team was in that position,” Clark said in the post-game press conference. “All the credit in the world to LSU. They were tremendous. They deserve it. They had a tremendous season.

“(LSU head coach) Kim Mulkey coached them so, so well. She’s one of the best basketball coaches of all time, and it shows. She only said really kind things to me in the handshake line, so I’m very grateful of that too.

“But honestly I have no idea. I was just trying to spend the last few moments on the court with especially the five people that I’ve started 93 games with and relishing every second of that.”

LSU head coach Mulkey said she had “no clue” about what transpired.

Among those defending Reese on social media were ESPN’s Holly Rowe and former NBA star Etan Thomas.

“People hating on Angel Reese or Caitlin Clark. Stop. Unapologetically confident young women should be celebrated NOT hated. Get used to it,” Rowe wrote on Twitter.

Former Washington Wizards, Oklahoma City Thunder and Atlanta Hawks player Thomas wrote: “Hold on now!!!! It was cute when Caitlin Clark did it. Y’all didn’t have any issues with it at all. So don’t be all outraged and talking about class and sportsmanship when Angel Reese does the same thing. We’re not doing double standards here.”

Reese said the negative reaction on social media throughout the season has helped fuel her excellent season, having finished averaging 23.0 points and 15.4 rebounds in her first season with LSU after transferring from Maryland.

Summer McIntosh: Canadian teenager breaks another world record,"CNN —

Sixteen-year-old Summer McIntosh broke the world record for the 400m individual medley at the Canadian swimming trials on Saturday – just days after breaking the world record for the 400m freestyle.

McIntosh finished the 400m individual medley in a time of 4:25.87, breaking the mark set at the 2016 Rio Olympics by Hungarian swimmer Katinka Hosszú with a time of 4:26.36.

The result continues the teenager’s brilliant week after she broke the 400m freestyle world record last Tuesday – breaking defending Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus’ previous record of 3:56.40, which was set last May, in a time of 3:56.08.

Speaking after her latest triumph, McIntosh shared her emotions.

“That’s the first time I really vividly heard the crowd during my race,” McIntosh said, per Reuters.

“It’s amazing to have all my family and friends in the stands, cheering me on. It really helped me in the last 100 meters.”

The Canadian teen made her Olympic debut aged 14 at Tokyo 2020, where she finished fourth in the 200-meter freestyle.

She bagged gold in the 200m butterfly and 400m medley at the world championships in 2022, as well as two golds at the Commonwealth Games in the 200m and 400m medleys.

The haunting Masters meltdown that changed Rory McIlroy’s career,"Editor’s Note: This story was originally published in April 2023.

CNN —

Slumped on his club, head buried in his arm, Rory McIlroy looked on the verge of tears.

The then-21-year-old had just watched his ball sink into the waters of Rae’s Creek at Augusta National and with it, his dream of winning The Masters, a dream that had looked so tantalizingly close mere hours earlier.

As a four-time major winner and one of the most decorated names in the sport’s history, few players would turn down the chance to swap places with McIlroy heading into Augusta this week.

Yet on Sunday afternoon of April 10, 2011, not a golfer in the world would have wished to be in the Northern Irishman’s shoes.

Flying

A fresh-faced, mop-headed McIlroy had touched down in Georgia for the first major of the season with a reputation as the leading light of the next generation of stars.

An excellent 2010 had marked his best season since turning pro three years earlier, highlighted by a first PGA Tour win at the Quail Hollow Championship and a crucial contribution to Team Europe’s triumph at the Ryder Cup.

Yet despite a pair of impressive top-three finishes at the Open and PGA Championship respectively, a disappointing missed cut at The Masters – his first at a major – served as ominous foreshadowing.

McIlroy shot 74 and 77 to fall four strokes short of the cut line at seven-over par, a performance that concerned him enough to take a brief sabbatical from competition.

But one year on in 2011, any lingering Masters demons looked to have been exorcised as McIlroy flew round the Augusta fairways.

Having opened with a bogey-free seven-under 65 – the first time he had ever shot in the 60s at the major – McIlroy pulled ahead from Spanish first round co-leader Alvaro Quirós with a second round 69.

It sent him into the weekend holding a two-shot cushion over Australia’s Jason Day, with Tiger Woods a further stroke behind and back in the hunt for a 15th major after a surging second round 66.

And yet the 21-year-old leader looked perfectly at ease with having a target on his back. Even after a tentative start to the third round, McIlroy rallied with three birdies across the closing six holes to stretch his lead to four strokes heading into Sunday.

The youngster was out on his own ahead of a bunched chasing pack comprising Day, Ángel Cabrera, K.J. Choi and Charl Schwartzel. After 54 holes, McIlroy had shot just three bogeys.

“It’s a great position to be in … I’m finally feeling comfortable on this golf course,” McIlroy told reporters.

“I’m not getting ahead of myself, I know how leads can dwindle away very quickly. I have to go out there, not take anything for granted and go out and play as hard as I’ve played the last three days. If I can do that, hopefully things will go my way.

“We’ll see what happens tomorrow because four shots on this golf course isn’t that much.”

Falling

The truth can hurt, and McIlroy was about to prove his assessment of Augusta to be true in the most excruciating way imaginable.

His fourth bogey of the week arrived immediately. Having admitted to expecting some nerves at the first tee, McIlroy sparked a booming opening drive down the fairway, only to miss his putt from five feet.

Three consecutive pars steadied the ship, but Schwartzel had the wind in his sails. A blistering birdie, par, eagle start had seen him draw level at the summit after his third hole.

A subsequent bogey from the South African slowed his charge, as McIlroy clung onto a one-shot lead at the turn from Schwartzel, Cabrera, Choi, and a rampaging Woods, who shot five birdies and an eagle across the front nine to send Augusta into a frenzy.

Despite his dwindling advantage and the raucous Tiger-mania din ahead of him, McIlroy had responded well to another bogey at the 5th hole, draining a brilliant 20-foot putt at the 7th to restore his lead.

The fist pump that followed marked the high-water point of McIlroy’s round, as a sliding start accelerated into full-blown free-fall at the par-four 10th hole.

His tee shot went careening into a tree, ricocheting to settle between the white cabins that separate the main course from the adjacent par-three course. It offered viewers a glimpse at a part of Augusta rarely seen on broadcast, followed by pictures of McIlroy anxiously peering out from behind a tree to track his follow-up shot.

Though his initial escape was successful, yet another collision with a tree and a two-putt on the green saw a stunned McIlroy eventually tap in for a triple bogey. Having led the field one hole and seven shots earlier, he arrived at the 11th tee in seventh.

By the time his tee drive at the 13th plopped into the creek, all thoughts of who might be the recipient of the green jacket had long-since switched away from the anguished youngster. It had taken him seven putts to navigate the previous two greens, as a bogey and a double bogey dropped him to five-under – the score he had held after just 11 holes of the tournament.

Mercifully, the last five holes passed without major incident. A missed putt for birdie from five feet at the final hole summed up McIlroy’s day, though he was given a rousing reception as he left the green.

Mere minutes earlier, the same crowd had erupted as Schwartzel sunk his fourth consecutive birdie to seal his first major title. After starting the day four shots adrift of McIlroy, the South African finished 10 shots ahead of him, and two ahead of second-placed Australian duo Jason Day and Adam Scott.

McIlroy’s eight-over 80 marked the highest score of the round. Having headlined the leaderboard for most of the week, he finished tied-15th.

Bounce-back

Tears would flow during a phone call with his parents the following morning, but at his press conference, McIlroy was upbeat.

“I’m very disappointed at the minute, and I’m sure I will be for the next few days, but I’ll get over it,” he said.

“I was leading this golf tournament with nine holes to go, and I just unraveled … It’s a Sunday at a major, what it can do.

“This is my first experience at it, and hopefully the next time I’m in this position I’ll be able to handle it a little better. I didn’t handle it particularly well today obviously, but it was a character-building day … I’ll come out stronger for it.”

Once again, McIlroy would be proven right.

Just eight weeks later in June, McIlroy rampaged to an eight-shot victory at the US Open. Records tumbled in his wake at Congressional, as he shot a tournament record 16-under 268 to become the youngest major winner since Tiger Woods at The Masters in 1997.

The historic victory kickstarted a golden era for McIlroy. After coasting to another eight-shot win at the PGA Championship in 2012, McIlroy became only the third golfer since 1934 to win three majors by the age of 25 with triumph at the 2014 Open Championship.

Before the year was out, he would add his fourth major title with another PGA Championship win.

And much of it was owed to that fateful afternoon at Augusta. In an interview with the BBC in 2015, McIlroy dubbed it “the most important day” of his career.

“If I had not had the whole unravelling, if I had just made a couple of bogeys coming down the stretch and lost by one, I would not have learned as much.

“Luckily, it did not take me long to get into a position like that again when I was leading a major and I was able to get over the line quite comfortably. It was a huge learning curve for me and I needed it, and thankfully I have been able to move on to bigger and better things.

“Looking back on what happened in 2011, it doesn’t seem as bad when you have four majors on your mantelpiece.”

The missing piece

McIlroy’s contentment came with a caveat: it would be “unthinkable” if he did not win The Masters in his career.

Yet as he prepares for his 15th appearance at Augusta National this week, a green jacket remains an elusive missing item from his wardrobe.

Despite seven top-10 finishes in his past 10 Masters outings, the trophy remains the only thing separating McIlroy from joining the ranks of golf immortals to have completed golf’s career grand slam of all four majors in the modern era: Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, and Tiger Woods.

A runner-up finish to Scottie Scheffler last year marked McIlroy’s best finish at Augusta, yet arguably 2011 remains the closest he has ever been to victory. A slow start in 2022 meant McIlroy had begun Sunday’s deciding round 10 shots adrift of the American, who teed off for his final hole with a five-shot lead despite McIlroy’s brilliant 64 finish.

At 33 years old, time is still on his side. Though 2022 extended his major drought to eight years, it featured arguably his best golf since that golden season in 2014.

2023 March Madness: UConn defeats San Diego State in the national championship game,"CNN —

The University of Connecticut won its fifth men’s basketball national title with a 76-59 victory over San Diego State University on Monday night at NRG Stadium in Houston.

Senior guard Tristen Newton led UConn (31-8) with 19 points and 10 rebounds while Final Four Most Outstanding Player Adama Sanogo, a junior forward, chipped in with 17 points and 10 rebounds.

“We weren’t ranked going into the year so we had the chip on our shoulder,” UConn head coach Dan Hurley told game broadcaster CBS. “We knew the level that we could play at, even through those dark times,” he added, referencing the team’s six losses in eight games during the regular season.

He said going into the tournament his group had confidence garnered during the season.

“And when you have the type of leaders like Andre Jackson (game-high six assists Monday) and Adama Sanogo, they kept this team together, got us back on track and we knew we were the best team in the tournament going in and we just had to play to our level,” he added.

San Diego State (32-7) was topped by Keshad Johnson who had 14 points.

UConn trailed very early but San Diego State was undone by an 11-minute, eight-second stretch in which they scored just five free throws and missed 12 consecutive shots from the field. The Huskies went from down 10-6 to up 36-24 at halftime.

The Aztecs made a run midway through the second half and narrowed the deficit to five at 60-55 with 5:19 to play but the Huskies scored the next nine to take a comfortable lead into the final two minutes.

“We battled. Battled back to five in the second half, but gave them too much separation,” San Diego State coach Brian Dutcher said. “We had to be at our best. We weren’t at our best. A lot had to do with UConn.”

Senior guard Adam Seiko told reporters they gave themselves a chance with their second half comeback but UConn “just made a little bit more plays” at the end.

“They have a lot of weapons. They were pretty good,” said Matt Bradley, also a senior guard. “To beat them, we had to make shots. I shot poorly. And you had to have a really good game to beat those dudes on the offensive end.”

UConn won each of its six tournament games by at least 10 points, with its closest game being a 13-point win over the University of Miami in the national semifinals.

“I just want to thank my teammates, my coaches who believed in me. If it were not for them I would not be here right now,” Sanogo told CBS.

Jordan Hawkins, who scored 16 points for UConn, talked about winning the crown one day after his cousin, Angel Reese of Louisiana State University, won the women’s title.

“I mean it’s absolutely amazing that we both get this opportunity and I mean the family reunion is going to be great so that’s all I know,” he said.

UConn enters rarefied air as only the sixth team to win five NCAA men’s basketball championships, joining UCLA (11), Kentucky (eight), North Carolina (six), Duke (five) and Indiana (five). All of UConn’s titles have come since 1999 with the most recent before Monday occurring in 2014.

Shania Twain calls for equal play and more diversity in country music,"CNN —

Shania Twain is standing up for others in country music.

The legendary star in the genre used her acceptance speech for the Equal Play Award at Sunday’s CMT Awards to call for more equity and diversity in the country music industry.

“When I wrote the phrase ‘Man I feel like a woman’ I honestly had no idea at the time it would become an undercurrent of a decades-long career,” she said, referring to one of her biggest hits. “It’s amazing how one statement can empower so many.”

The phrase, Twain said, “has been adopted by an array of fantastic communities all around the world and become a genuine path of power…which brings me so much joy.”

“I believe in an all-inclusive country music. We’re family,” Twain said. “This is a genre of music with a rich history that raised and nurtured my own songwriting and performance and recording career from childhood. Currently, the industry standard does a real disservice to this.”

Twain, who was presented the award by rapper Megan Thee Stallion, shouted out some of the diverse acts she is spotlighting on her “Queen of Me” tour this year, including Lily Rose, Lindsay Ell, Hailey Whitters, Mickey Guyton and others.

“I will continue to do my best as a trailblazer,” Twain said. “Together, let’s ensure all our fellow artists get equal play regardless of gender, age or race.”

She also performed acappella with the African American singing group, The BoykinZ, while presenting an award onstage. Twain connected with the group, who are sisters and rising country stars, after Kelly Clarkson surprised them recently by bringing Twain out to meet them during an episode of Clarkson’s daytime talk show.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/entertainment/shania-twain-equal-diversity/index.html,1
