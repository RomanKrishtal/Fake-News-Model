President Donald Trump has called for Harvard University to lose a valuable tax break, hours after his administration announced it is freezing more than $2bn (£1.5bn) in federal funds for the elite institution. The White House has demanded the oldest university in the US make changes to hiring, admissions and teaching practices which it says will help fight antisemitism on campus. Since returning to office, Trump has pushed to reshape top universities by threatening to withhold federal funds that are mostly designated for research. Harvard became the first major US university to reject his administration's demands on Monday, accusing the White House of trying to ""control"" its community.

In a Tuesday morning post on social media, Trump threatened to go beyond withholding the federal funds and targeted Harvard tax-exempt status. Universities, as well as many charities and religious groups, are exempted from paying federal income taxes. This valuable tax break, though, can be removed if the groups become involved in political activities or move away from their stated purposes. ""Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting ""Sickness?"" he wrote on Truth Social. ""Remember, Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!"" Losing the exemption could cost Harvard millions of dollars each year. Later on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump wanted the university to apologize for what his administration says is continuing tolerance of antisemitism. ""[Trump] wants to see Harvard apologize, and Harvard should apologize,"" Leavitt said.

Watch: White House says Harvard should apologise to Jewish students

The sweeping changes demanded by the White House would have transformed Harvard's operations and ceded a large amount of control to the government. Its letter to Harvard on Friday, obtained by the New York Times, said the university had failed to live up to the ""intellectual and civil rights conditions"" that justify federal investment. The letter included 10 categories for proposed changes, including: reporting students to the federal government who are ""hostile"" to American values

ensuring each academic department is ""viewpoint diverse""

hiring an external government-approved party to audit programs and departments ""that most fuel antisemitic harassment""

checking faculty staff for plagiarism

President Trump has accused leading universities of failing to protect Jewish students when college campuses around the country were roiled by protests against the war in Gaza and US support for Israel last year. The letter orders the university to take disciplinary action for ""violations"" that happened during protests. In explaining its rejection of these demands, Harvard President Alan Garber said the university will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights under the First Amendment protecting free speech. ""Although some of the demands outlined by the government are aimed at combating antisemitism, the majority represent direct governmental regulation of the 'intellectual conditions' at Harvard,"" he said. Columbia University agrees to Trump demand for mask ban

Trump pulls $400m from Columbia University

Why has Trump revoked hundreds of international student visas? Shortly after his letter of resistance was sent, the education department said it was freezing $2.2bn in grants and $60m in contracts to Harvard immediately. ""Harvard's statement today reinforces the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation's most prestigious universities and colleges,"" the Department of Education said in a statement. The disruption of learning plaguing campuses is unacceptable and the harassment of Jewish students intolerable, the statement said.

A professor of history at Harvard, David Armitage, told the BBC that the school could afford to resist as the richest university in the US and no price was too high to pay for freedom. ""It's a not unexpected act of entirely groundless and vengeful activity by the Trump administration which wants nothing more than to silence freedom of speech,"" he said. In March, the Trump administration said it was reviewing roughly $256m in federal contracts and grants at Harvard, and an additional $8.7bn in multi-year grant commitments. Harvard professors filed a lawsuit in response, alleging the government was unlawfully attacking freedom of speech and academic freedom. Harvard, which has a $53bn endowment, is one of a number of elite universities in the crosshairs of the new presidency. Columbia University in New York City agreed to a number of demands last month after the White House pulled $400m in federal funding. Polling by Gallup last summer suggested that confidence in higher education has been falling over time among Americans of all political backgrounds, partly driven by a growing belief that universities push a political agenda. The decline was particularly steep among Republicans.

Trump tariffs: US orders from Chinese small businesses on hold,"'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs

The BBC's Laura Bicker: ''A number of businesses in limbo'' in China, after US tariffs on imports

""Trump is a crazy man,"" says Lionel Xu, who is surrounded by his company's mosquito repellent kits – many were once best sellers in Walmart stores in the United States. Now those products are sitting in boxes in a warehouse in China and will remain there unless President Donald Trump lifts his 145% tariffs on all Chinese goods bound for the US. ""This is so hard for us,"" he adds. Around half of all products made by his company Sorbo Technology are sold to the US. It is a small company by Chinese standards and has around 400 workers in Zhejiang province. But they are not alone in feeling the pain of this economic war. ""We are worried. What if Trump doesn't change his mind? That will be a dangerous thing for our factory,"" says Mr Xu.

Nearby, Amy is helping to sell ice cream makers at her booth for the Guangdong Sailing Trade Company. Her key buyers, including Walmart, are also in the US. ""We have stopped production already,"" she says. ""All the products are in the warehouse."" It was the same story at nearly every booth in the sprawling Canton Fair in the trading hub of Guangzhou. When the BBC speaks to Mr Xu, he is getting ready to take some Australian buyers to lunch. They have come looking for a bargain and hope to drive down the price. ""We will see,"" he says about the tariffs. He believes Trump will back down. ""Maybe it will get better in one or two months. Maybe, maybe,"" Mr Xu adds with his fingers crossed.

Xiqing Wang/ BBC The US and China have both slapped high tariffs on each other

Last week, President Trump temporarily paused the vast majority of tariffs after global stock markets tumbled, and a sell-off in the US bond market. But he kept the import levies targeted at Chinese goods being shipped to the US. Beijing responded by imposing its own 125% levies on American imports. This has bewildered traders from more than 30,000 businesses who have come to the annual fair to show off their goods in several exhibition halls the size of 200 football pitches. In the homeware section, firms displayed everything from washing machines to tumble dryers, electric toothbrushes to juicers and waffle makers. Buyers come from all over the world to see the products for themselves and make a deal. But the cost of a food mixer or a vacuum cleaner from China with the added tariffs are now too high for most American firms to pass on the cost to their customers. The world's two largest economies have hit an impasse and Chinese goods meant for US households are piling up on factory floors. The effects of this trade war will likely be felt in kitchens and living rooms across America, who will now have to buy these goods at higher prices. China has maintained its defiant stance and has vowed to fight this trade war ""until the end."" It is a tone also used by some at the fair. Hy Vian, who was looking to buy some electric ovens for his firm, waved off the effects of tariffs. ""If they don't want us to export – then let them wait. We already have a domestic market in China, we will give the best products to the Chinese first.""

Xiqing Wang/ BBC Lionel Xu says he and other staff at Sorbo Technology are worried about what happens if Trump does not lift the tariffs on China

China does have a large population of 1.4 billion people and in theory this is a strong domestic market. Chinese policymakers have also been trying to stimulate more growth in a sluggish economy by encouraging consumers to spend. But it is not working. Many of the country's middle classes have invested their savings in buying the family home, only to watch their house prices slump in the last four years. Now they want to save money – not spend it. While China may be better placed to weather the storm than other countries, the reality is that it is still an export driven economy. Last year, exports accounted for around half of the country's economic growth. China also remains the world's factory – with Goldman Sachs estimating that around 10 to 20 million people in China may be working on US-bound exports alone.

Xiqing Wang/ BBC Businesses at the Canton Fair in Guangzhou said they have stopped sending goods to the US

Some of its workers are already feeling the pain. Not far from the Canton Fair, there are warrens of workshops in Guangdong making clothes, shoes and bags. This is the manufacturing hub for companies such as Shein and Temu. Each building houses several factories on several floors where workers will labour for 14 hours a day. On a pavement near some shoe factories, a few workers were squatting down to chat and smoke. ""Things are not going well,"" says one, who was unwilling to give his name. His friend urges him to stop talking. Discussing economic difficulties can be sensitive in China. ""We've had problems since the Covid pandemic, and now there's this trade war. I used to be paid 300-400 yuan ($40-54) a day, and now I will be lucky if I get 100 yuan a day.""

Donald Trump has again blamed Volodymyr Zelensky for starting the war with Russia – a day after a major Russian attack killed 35 people and injured 117 others in the Ukrainian city of Sumy. The US president said Ukraine's leader shared the blame with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the ""millions of people dead"" in the conflict. ""You don't start a war against someone 20 times your size and then hope that people give you some missiles,"" he said at the White House on Monday. His comments followed Russia's strike on Sumy on Sunday - the deadliest attack on civilians this year. Moscow also hit the city's outskirts on Monday night.

BBC visits scene of destruction in Sumy after Russian attack

Nato's secretary general Mark Rutte went to Ukraine on Tuesday in a show of solidarity with Kyiv following the missile strikes. Joining Zelensky in Odesa, Rutte condemned the ""terrible pattern"" of attacks on civilians and said ""Russia is the aggressor, Russia started this war, there's no doubt"". Trump on Monday had first described the Sumy attack as ""terrible"" but said he had been told Russia had ""made a mistake"". He did not give further detail. Moscow said it had targeted a meeting of Ukrainian soldiers, killing 60 of them, but did not provide any evidence. Meanwhile, Ukrainian media reported that there had been a medal ceremony for military veterans in the city on the day of the attack. Zelensky sacked Sumy's regional chief on Tuesday, for allegedly hosting the event, local media reported. Trump on Monday also blamed his predecessor Joe Biden for the war's casualties- which are estimated in the hundreds of thousands, not the millions he's claimed. ""Millions of people dead because of three people,"" Trump had said. ""Let's say Putin number one, let's say Biden who had no idea what the hell he was doing, number two, and Zelensky."" Questioning Zelensky's competence, he said the Ukrainian leader was ""always looking to purchase missiles"". ""When you start a war, you got to know you can win,"" the US president said. Trump has repeatedly blamed Zelensky and Biden for the war, despite Russia invading Ukraine first in 2014, five years before Zelensky won the presidency, and then launching a full-scale invasion in 2022. Trump further argued on Monday that ""Biden could have stopped it and Zelensky could have stopped it, and Putin should have never started it. Everybody is to blame"". Tensions between Trump and Zelensky have been high since a heated confrontation at the White House in February, where the US leader chided Ukraine's president for not starting peace talks with Russia earlier.

By contrast, Trump has taken action to drastically improve relations with Moscow. Trump's administration has sought to broker a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine and has held negotiations with Moscow that have cut out Kyiv. Trump said he had a ""great"" phone call with Putin last month, and the Russian president sent him a portrait as a gift a week later. In February, Washington voted with Moscow against a UN resolution that identified Russia as the ""aggressor"" in Russia's war against Ukraine. After talks between US and Russian officials failed to produce a ceasefire in Ukraine, Trump said he was ""very angry"" with Putin, though he added he had a ""good relationship"" with the Russian leader.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5q0mev07lo,1
Hamas rejects Israeli truce disarmament proposal,"Hamas rejects Israeli ceasefire disarmament proposal, Palestinian official says

EPA Armed members of Hamas's military wing took part in hostage handover ceremonies during the recent ceasefire

Hamas is said to have rejected an Israeli proposal for a six-week ceasefire in Gaza which called for the armed group to give up its weapons. A senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks said the plan gave no commitment to end the war or for an Israeli troop pull-out - key Hamas demands - in exchange for releasing half of the living hostages which it holds. It comes as Israel continues its military offensive in Gaza. A security guard was killed and nine other people were injured in an air strike on a field hospital in Khan Younis, the hospital said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it struck the head of a Hamas cell.

A UN agency meanwhile warned that ""the humanitarian situation in Gaza is now likely the worst it has been in the 18 months since the outbreak of hostilities"". It is six weeks since Israel allowed any supplies to enter through crossings into the Palestinian territory - by far the longest such stoppage to date. UN agencies strongly refute Israel's claim that there is enough food in Gaza to last for a long time and suggest the blockade could breach international humanitarian law. Israel's prime minister said the block on supplies was aimed at pressuring Hamas to release hostages and to extend the ceasefire which expired on 1 March. At the same time, the UN's humanitarian affairs office stated: ""Partners on the ground report a surge in attacks causing mass civilian casualties and the destruction of some of the remaining infrastructure that's needed to keep people alive.""

Israel is said to have submitted its latest ceasefire proposal to regional mediators late last week, just days after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met US President Donald Trump in Washington. A Hamas delegation headed by chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya then met Egyptian intelligence officials in Cairo. The senior Palestinian official told the BBC: ""The Israeli proposal relayed to the movement through Egypt explicitly called for the disarmament of Hamas without any Israeli commitment to end the war or withdraw from Gaza. Hamas therefore rejected the offer in its entirety."" It is understood to be the first time that Israel has added Hamas disarmament as a condition for advancing a ceasefire - a red line for the group. The Palestinian official accused Israel of stalling for time, seeking only to retrieve the hostages while prolonging the war. It is believed that 59 hostages remain in Gaza, of whom 24 are alive. On Tuesday afternoon, the spokesman for Hamas's military wing said it had ""lost contact"" with a group of fighters holding Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander following what he described as ""a direct strike on their location"". Abu Ubaida produced no evidence to support the claim and gave no indication of when contact had been lost. Israel has said it avoids hitting locations where it believes hostages are being held. Hamas released a video of the 21-year-old soldier on Saturday, in which he appeared to be speaking under duress as he criticised the Israeli government.

Reuters In Israel, polls suggest a majority of Israelis back a new Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal

Recently released hostages related how many were held with them in dire conditions underground. Some are in poor health with untreated injuries. Hamas has said it is ready to return all of those held captive, in exchange for a complete end to hostilities and full Israeli pull-out from Gaza. It previously offered five hostages in exchange for a truce extension but claims to have shown flexibility on the number of hostages to be released. The BBC understands that Egypt has put forward a modified proposal to Hamas which it is now considering. Israeli media had not been anticipating an imminent ceasefire breakthrough. The newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth quoted an unnamed Israeli senior security official as saying: ""We assess that there will be a deal within two-three weeks, but right now there are still gaps and the distance is great."" ""We want to get them to release 19 living hostages. Israel and the United States are co-ordinated, and the military pressure is having an impact,"" the official went on. ""They have a shortage of gas, and the food and the fuel will run out in a few weeks. The big achievement of the residents' return to the northern Gaza Strip has been erased. Pressure from the residents has begun. That's rattled them."" Israel resumed its bombardment of Gaza on 18 March and then restarted ground operations, saying it was targeting Hamas. The prime minister said future ceasefire talks would be held ""under fire"". Since Israel restarted its offensive in Gaza, at least 1,630 people have been killed - bringing the total killed in 18 months of war to 51,000, according to the latest figures from the Hamas-run health ministry. Some 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage in the unprecedented Hamas-led 7 October attacks which triggered the war, Israel says.

Anadolu A Kuwaiti field hospital in southern Gaza said a security guard was killed by an Israeli strike at its northern gate on Tuesday

On Tuesday morning, Israeli warplanes struck by the gate of the Kuwaiti Field Hospital in al-Mawasi, a crowded tented area for displaced people on the coast near Khan Younis in southern Gaza, hospital spokesman Saber Abu Arar told the BBC. The man killed worked at the site, he said, and those injured were both hospital staff and patients. Three ambulances and some tents used as a reception area were damaged. Graphic footage released by the field hospital on Facebook showed a man covered in blood being rushed away with attempts made to resuscitate him. The IDF said in a statement that it ""struck the head of a Hamas terrorist cell and a combat zone commander"" outside the hospital, without giving any evidence. It also said a ""precise munition"" was used to mitigate harm in the area. The attack comes after the UN Secretary General, António Guterres, said he was ""deeply alarmed"" at Sunday's strike on al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, his spokesman said. Israel said it targeted a building at the site which Hamas was using as ""a command-and-control centre"" - something the group denied. Doctors scrambled to evacuate the hospital, saying they were given just a 20-minute warning by the IDF. A 12-year-old boy being treated for head injuries is said to have died because his care was disrupted. The hospital - which had been the best functioning in northern Gaza - is now out of service and cannot admit new patients. ""Under international humanitarian law, wounded and sick, medical personnel and medical facilities, including hospitals, must be respected and protected,"" the spokesman for Guterres said. He added that the attack dealt ""a severe blow to an already devastated healthcare system in the strip"", adding that with aid blocked, there was strong concern that medical supplies were now running low as well as stocks of food and water.

French prisons hit by wave of overnight attacks,"French prison attacks are 'terrorism' says justice minister

French officials suggested the attacks were linked to the government's crackdown on drug crime

Darmanin suggested the attacks which began on Sunday were a response to the government's crackdown on drug trafficking. France's anti-terrorism prosecutor's office has launched an investigation.

Seven prisons have been targeted, in Toulon, Aix-En-Provence, Marseille, Valence and Nîmes in southern France, and in Villepinte and Nanterre, near Paris.

On Monday night, vehicles were set alight outside several French prisons and one jail was hit by gunfire, in what Gérald Darmanin described as ""terrorist attacks"".

France's Justice Minister said the government would not give in to ""acts of intimidation"" after a wave of attacks targeting prisons across the country.

On Tuesday, Darmanin visited Toulon's La Farlede prison where gunmen opened fired on the prison gate with a Kalashnikov.

""I am delighted that the national anti-terrorism prosecutor's office has taken action because this is extremely serious,"" he told reporters. ""These are terrorist attacks.""

He added that ""significant means"" were being employed to find the perpetrators and they would be given ""extremely severe sentences"".

Darmanin indicated that the ""acts of intimidation against prison workers"" were related to government efforts to tackle drug crime.

""It might also be because we hit them where it hurts,"" he said, ""and for the first time in decades, France is taking extremely serious measures against drug trafficking.""

Earlier on Tuesday, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said the government's response must be ""relentless"".

""Those who attack prisons and officers deserve to be locked up in those prisons and monitored by those officers,"" he posted on X.

He added that he had instructed police to immediately strengthen security at prison facilities.

The prison guard union, FO Justice, expressed its ""deepest concern and anger"" following the ""extremely serious"" attacks overnight.

The union posted updates from the aftermath of several attacks on X, including images of burnt-out vehicles in prison car parks and bullet holes in the Toulon prison entrance gate.

It called for urgent government action to protect prison staff.

Another union, Ufap-Unsa Justice, said there were not enough officers to secure prison perimeters ""24/7"".

Ufap said that staff vehicles were among those set on fire outside the jails in Villepinte, Aix-Luynes, Nanterre and Valence.

The union condemned the ""cowardly and heinous attacks [that] aim to terrorise those who embody the authority of the state"".

In Nancy, a prison officer was reportedly threatened at their home, while in Marseille, an attempted arson attack targeted prison officers' accommodation.

Monday night's attacks come after seven vehicles were set on fire in a similar attack on France's national school of prison administration on Sunday, according to FO Justice.

""It is worrying to note that some people no longer hesitate to directly attack the prison's property, a symbol of state authority,"" it said in a statement.

No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but the Parisien reports that the letters DDPF - meaning ""French prisoners' rights"" - were found inscribed on damaged vehicles. The AFP news agency says anarchist slogans were found at some sites.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy75231z90o,1

Pushkin court press service Anna Alexandrova had denied posting anti-war remarks on social media

A hairdresser from St Petersburg has been given a jail term of five years and two months on a charge of spreading fake news about the Russian army. Anna Alexandrova denied posting eight anti-war messages on social media, insisting the case was motivated by a squabble over land with a neighbour. Her neighbour told the BBC that she had complained to prosecutors after Alexandrova had sent her daughter pictures of the war in Ukraine. Discrediting the armed forces and intentionally spreading fake news about the military became a crime in Russia within weeks of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Ever since the war began, the Kremlin has intensified a crackdown on dissent, jailing hundreds of opponents and critics and silencing independent media. In a separate case on Tuesday, four journalists were jailed in Moscow for five and a half years after being found guilty of working for an ""extremist organisation"". Antonina Favorskaya, Kostantin Gabov, Sergey Karelin and Artyom Kriger had all insisted they were only doing their jobs as journalists, but the court found they had produced work used by an anti-corruption group founded by Putin's chief opponent Alexei Navalny. Navalny was found dead in a penal colony in the Arctic Circle last year. Video captured by Favorskaya on a courtroom video link the day before Navalny's controversial death was the last time he was ever seen alive. Favorskaya worked for independent outlet SotaVision and was eventually arrested in March 2024 filming in a cemetery where he was buried.

Nests and some dead rodents were found in outbuildings of the house where Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman and his wife Betsy Arakawa were found dead. New Mexico Department of Public Health records seen by BBC News documented evidence of the animals in eight detached buildings at their home in Santa Fe. US officials previously confirmed that Ms Arakawa, 65, died from a respiratory illness linked to hantavirus, which can be transmitted by infected rodents. It is believed she died a week before her husband, 95, who was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease. Authorities found the deceased couple in their home in February.

An environmental assessment of the property took place on 5 March, a week after they were discovered, as part of the investigation into their deaths. It found rodent faeces, a live rodent, dead rodent and a rodent nest in three garages, in addition to further rodent droppings in two small external houses and three sheds. Traps had also been set up. There were sightings of rodents, a nest and faeces in two abandoned vehicles or farming machinery in the grounds of the property. All eight detached outbuildings were within 50 yards (45 metres) of the main house where the couple lived, which itself was ""clean with no signs of rodent activity,"" New Mexico public health officials said in their eight-page report.

Angry Nigerians are turning to social media to describe how they have been locked out of their accounts on the digital financial platform, CBEX. People have posted videos of themselves crying, saying that they could not withdraw their investments and worried that their money had gone. Some furious customers ransacked a CBEX office in the south-west city of Ibadan, carting off chairs, air-conditioners and a solar panel. CBEX has not yet publicly commented. The company had promised that investors would double their money every month. Nigeria is currently facing straitened economic times and many are desperate to find a way to boost their income.

One investor, identified as Ola, told BBC Pidgin that he feared he had lost 450,000 naira ($280; £210). ""I was ready to withdraw all my investment just last week but my friend told me to be patient and wait - and now it has crashed,"" Ola said. Many others have shared similar stories online, with one person talking about losing $16,000. The problem was first noticed over the weekend, but the anger boiled over when Monday came and people were still not able to access their money. Some investors who made complaints on the private messaging service Telegram received responses from CBEX. They were told that the problem was the result of a hack and things will be resolved soon. Nigeria's Securities and Exchange Commission (Sec), which regulates the investment secotr, has not yet responded to a BBC request for comment. But Sec has previously warned citizens about the risks surrounding unregulated digital platforms and potential Ponzi schemes For some, the situation brings back painful memories from 2016 when another popular financial scheme, called MMM, froze its transactions, leaving many investors heartbroken. Members were supposed to receive a 30% return on their investment in just 30 days.

"Architect Antoni Gaudí on path to sainthood, Pope confirms","Pope puts architect Antoni Gaudí on path to sainthood

That is an early step on the road to a candidate for sainthood being formally canonised by the Catholic Church.

On Monday, the Vatican issued a statement which said Pope Francis had authorised a decree declaring the Catalonia-born architect ""venerable"".

Gaudí - who has been dubbed by some as ""God's architect"" - is the designer of one of Spain's most famous religious sites and tourist attractions, the unfinished Sagrada Familia basilica in Barcelona.

The Vatican has put Spanish architect Antoni Gaudí on the path to sainthood in recognition of his ""heroic virtues"".

Casa Batlló is among his other works scattered around Barcelona

It is the latest development in a decades-long campaign to have Gaudí, who was a devout Catholic, recognised as a saint.

The Archbishop of Barcelona, Cardinal Juan Jose Omella, called the news a ""joy"".

""It is a recognition not only of his architectural work but something more important,"" he said, according to AFP news agency.

The cardinal continued: ""He is saying you... amid life's difficulties, amid work, amid pain, amid suffering, are destined to be saints.""

The usual formal process for someone to be declared a saint would next involve beatification, one step short of full sainthood.

That is a category reserved for martyrs, those deemed to have lived a life of heroic values and candidates who the Church declares to have a saintly reputation.

In the case of Gaudí, who died in 1926 after being hit by a tram while walking to church, the Vatican would likely require proof of a miracle that could be attributed to him post-death in order to proceed with beatification.

Gaudí was born in 1852 and many of his best known works continue to attract visitors to Barcelona, where much of his legacy is situated.

The Sagrada Familia basilica has been under construction since 1883 and remains unfinished.

It has been placed on Unesco's World Heritage list, along with some of Gaudi's other works, and was consecrated by Pope Benedict XVI in 2010.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn5xepgypplo,1
Obama calls Trump administration's freeze on Harvard funding 'unlawful',"Obama calls Trump's freeze of Harvard funding 'unlawful'

He called on other institutions to follow Harvard's lead in not conceding to Trump's demands.

President Donald Trump is freezing more than $2bn (£1.5bn) in federal funds for Harvard because it would not make changes to its hiring, admissions and teaching practices that his administration said were key to fighting antisemitism on campus.

Former President Barack Obama is applauding Harvard University's decision to refuse the White House's demands that it change its policies or lose federal money, in his first social media post to criticise the Trump administration since at least Inauguration Day.

""Harvard has set an example for other higher-ed institutions – rejecting an unlawful and ham-handed attempt to stifle academic freedom, while taking concrete steps to make sure all students at Harvard can benefit from an environment of intellectual inquiry, rigorous debate and mutual respect,"" Obama wrote on social media.

The former president, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1991, has rarely criticised or rebuked government officials or government policies on social media since leaving the White House almost a decade ago. His posts during the election typically extolled Trump's challenger, then-Vice-President Kamala Harris, and since Inauguration Day, he has mainly posted tributes, personal messages and thoughts on sports.

Obama is one of a handful of US political figures and university officials now speaking out against the Trump administration's attempts to reshape the country's top universities, through pressure to change what they teach and who they hire and threats to cut research funding.

Hundreds of faculty members at Yale University, published a letter expressing their support for Harvard's decision to reject the Trump administration's demands.

""We stand together at a crossroads,"" the letter read. ""American universities are facing extraordinary attacks that threaten the bedrock principles of a democratic society, including rights of free expression, association, and academic freedom. We write as one faculty, to ask you to stand with us now.""

Many US universities receive some type of federal funding which is mostly designated for scientific research in areas such as drug development.

Since Trump returned to office in January, elite institutions such as Stanford University have had to freeze hiring and cut budgets in the face of shrinking federal funds.

Some of the funding has been paused to press universities to take steps that the Trump administration says will fight antisemitism. Trump has accused them of failing to protect Jewish students during last year's campus protests against the war in Gaza and US support for Israel.

Stanford President Jonathan Levin and Provost Jenny Martinez on Tuesday said in a statement praising Harvard that ""universities need to address legitimate criticisms with humility and openness"".

""But the way to bring about constructive change is not by destroying the nation's capacity for scientific research, or through the government taking command of a private institution,"" they wrote.

While Columbia University ceded to some of Trump's demands earlier this month, Harvard became the first major US university to take the opposite approach.

""No government – regardless of which party is in power – should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,"" Harvard's president, Alan Garber, said in a statement on Monday.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) followed Harvard's lead on Monday and also rejected the Trump administration's demands.

Despite the criticism, Trump is standing fast. On Tuesday he took another strike against Harvard, threatening to revoke its tax-exempt status.

Universities, as well as many charities and religious groups, are exempted from paying federal income taxes. This valuable tax break, though, can be removed if the groups become involved in political activities or move away from their stated purposes.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0w2656x33o,1
Ghana gold: Foreigners ordered to exit local trading market to boost revenue,"Ghana bans foreigners from trading in its gold market to boost revenue

Many Chinese nationals have been active in Ghana's informal mining sector

Ghana is Africa's largest gold producer and the sixth largest in the world, but it is struggling to address widespread illegal gold mining, locally called ""galamsey"".

""All foreigners are hereby notified to exit the local gold trading market not later than 30th April, 2025,"" said GoldBod spokesperson Prince Kwame Minkah in a statement.

It follows the enactment of a new law earlier this month that grants exclusive authority of gold mining to a new state body, the Ghana Gold Board (GoldBod).

Ghana has banned all foreigners from trading in its local gold market as part of efforts to boost national revenue and streamline the country's mining sector.

The mineral-rich West African country has been facing harsh economic times with a high cost of living. It is the world's second largest cocoa producer but sees little of the profits from chocolate.

Fuelled by rising gold prices and youth unemployment, illegal gold mining has been growing in Ghana, despite military operations to shut down galamsey activities. It was a big campaign issue in the lead up to last December's elections.

Chinese nationals have been active in Ghana's informal mining and along with Ghanaian nationals, they have been repeatedly accused of ignoring environmental concerns.

Under the new law passed by parliament last month and assented to by President John Mahama on 2 April, GoldBod is the sole buyer, seller and exporter of all gold produced by the artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector.

However, foreigners are allowed to apply to buy or off-take gold directly from the GoldBod but can no longer operate within the local gold value chain.

The licenses of local dealers have also been revoked but given a grace period to allow a smooth transition before the directive takes effect next month.

During this period, gold transactions would only be carried out in Ghana cedis, the local currency, and priced based on the Bank of Ghana rates.

GoldBod warned that ""it shall constitute a punishable offence for a person to purchase or deal in gold in the country without a licence issued by the new board.

The government has allocated $279m (£212) to the new body to purchase and export at least three tonnes of gold per week.

The move is meant to help boost foreign exchange inflows and stabilise the local currency, said Finance Minister Cassel Ato Forson.

But Kwaku Effah Asuahene, the chairman of the Chamber of Bullion Traders Ghana, fears that the government may not be able to raise enough revenue to purchase all the gold.

He told BBC that while they support the initiative, they would have preferred to be allowed to partner with foreign investors to purchase the gold and export it through GoldBod.

Although GoldBod has not been created to specifically deal with illegal mining, the new directive could also make it difficult for illegal miners to sell gold in the country.

Ghana has been dealing with severe environmental pollution caused by the activities of illegal miners, and over 60% of the country's water bodies have been affected.

The ban is seen as the first concrete step by the new administration of President Mahama to tighten regulation and control of the gold sector and deliver on its anti-galamsey campaign promises.

""It sends a strong message to foreign actors - especially Chinese operatives - who have circumvented local laws for years,"" Nana Asante Krobea, a mining governance consultant, told the AFP news agency.

He said if properly applied, the new law could bolster government revenue and ""bring some order to the chaos in the gold sector"".

Ghana's gold exports grew by 53.2% to $11.64bn last year - nearly $5bn of that was from legal small-scale miners.

Gold prices shot up to $3,200 per ounce last week due to trade tensions between the US and China, which has forced investors to seek refuge in the commodity because of uncertainties.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvr0x3mkl1o,1

Watch: Moment Columbia student Mohsen Mahdawi arrested by ICE

An organiser of pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University has been arrested by immigration officials as he attended an interview as part of his application for US citizenship, his lawyer says. Mohsen Mahdawi, a green card holder who is due to graduate next month from the New York City college, was detained on Monday in Colchester, Vermont. His lawyer said Mr Mahdawi was taken into custody ""in direct retaliation"" for his role in campus demonstrations against the Israel-Gaza war. Others who took part in campus protests against the war, including Columbia University's Mahmoud Khalil and Tufts University's Rumeysa Ozturk, have been detained.

The BBC has contacted US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for more details on Mr Mahdawi's case. Video shared on social media apparently shows him being escorted into a car by two officers wearing police jackets. His lawyer, Luna Droubi, said: ""The Trump administration detained Mohsen Mahdawi in direct retaliation for his advocacy on behalf of Palestinians and because of his identity as a Palestinian. ""His detention is an attempt to silence those who speak out against the atrocities in Gaza. It is also unconstitutional."" The attorney applied to a federal court for a temporary restraining order to prevent US immigration authorities moving Mr Mahdawi out of Vermont or expelling him from the US. Judge William Sessions, an Obama appointee, quickly granted that order. The court filing says Mr Mahdawi was born in a refugee camp in the West Bank and moved to the US in 2014. It describes the philosophy major as a committed Buddhist who believes in ""non-violence and empathy as a central tenet of his religion"". The whereabouts of Mr Mahdawi, who has held US permanent resident status since 2015, are unknown, according to Ms Droubi.

Mr Mahdawi, who co-founded Columbia's Palestinian Student Society, has been an outspoken critic of Israel's military operation in Gaza. Last December, he did an interview with CBS' 60 Minutes programme in which he accused Israel of genocide, which it denies. Mr Mahdawi's detention comes amid an immigration crackdown by President Donald Trump's administration. Last month, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said at least 300 foreign students' visas had been revoked in an effort to tackle antisemitism on university campuses. Critics say US officials are falsely accusing students of anti-Jewish bigotry and violating their right to free speech. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders said on X that Mr Mahdawi ""was illegally detained by ICE during what was supposed to be the final step in his citizenship process"". The senator said he ""must be afforded due process under the law and immediately released from detention"". Judge Sessions also held a hearing on Monday in the case of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student at Boston's Tufts University, who was arrested by immigration authorities last month. He questioned whether the Trump administration would provoke a ""constitutional crisis"" by not releasing the student from custody if the court were to order that she be moved from detention in Louisiana back to Vermont. Meanwhile, lawyers for Mahmoud Khalil are currently challenging an immigration judge's ruling on Friday allowing the government to deport him as a national security risk. The Columbia University protest leader was detained last month outside his campus accommodation and transferred to a Louisiana detention centre.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy0332y7xzo,1
Dominican Republic nightclub collapse: Relatives press charges against owner,"Family of Dominican Republic nightclub collapse victim press charges

Vigils have been held for the more than 200 people who died in the accident

Jet Set's owner, Antonio Espaillat, has said in a video message that he is fully co-operating with the investigation into the causes of the collapse.

A lawyer for the Cruz Aponte family said they had brought manslaughter charges against the owner and managers of the Jet Set club. Other families have said that they also plan to file lawsuits.

Police lieutenant Virgilio Rafael Cruz Aponte was one of the 231 people killed when the roof of the Jet Set music venue collapsed during a merengue music concert.

The parents and wife of one of the people who died when the roof of a nightclub collapsed in the Dominican Republic last week have become the first to press charges against the club's owners.

Girl, 17, whose dad is lost in nightclub rubble spends birthday at scene

That investigation is expected to take several months, officials said.

A lawyer representing Mr Cruz Aponte's family said they had also accused the local government of neglecting its duty to ensure the venue complied with all necessary safety guidelines.

On Monday, the interior ministry said that the number of dead had risen to 231 after five more people died of the injuries they had sustained.

Interior Minister Faride Raful said 189 people had been pulled alive from the rubble.

Hundreds were inside the building on Monday evening to attend one of the club's regular dance music evenings, which on this particular occasion starred popular merengue singer Rubby Pérez.

Pérez and one of the saxophonists in his band, both of whom were on stage at the time of the collapse, died in the incident.

Pérez's daughter Zulinka, who was a backing singer in her father's band, managed to get out of the rubble alive.

According to the National Institute of Forensic Sciences, two French citizens, a Haitian, and an Italian national were among those killed.

The US State Department previously said that ""several"" US citizens had died.

The impact of the tragedy has been felt beyond the Dominican Republic, in places with large Dominican communities such as New York City.

New York Mayor Eric Adams travelled to Santo Domingo on Sunday and visited the site of the disaster.

""They are not merely my residents, I've considered them my family,"" he said of the Dominican residents of New York.

Getty Images Xi started his South East Asia trip in Vietnam

China's President Xi Jinping has called on Vietnam to oppose ""unilateral bullying"" to upkeep a global system of free trade - though he stopped short of naming the US. It comes as Xi is on a so called ""charm offensive"" trip across South East Asia, which will also see him visit Malaysia and Cambodia. Though the trip was long-planned, it has taken on heightened significance in the wake of a mounting trade war between the US and China. Vietnam was facing US tariffs of up to 46% before the Trump administration issued a 90-day pause last week. US President Donald Trump called Xi's meeting with Vietnamese leaders a ploy to figure out how to ""screw the United States of America"".

According to state media outlet Xinhua, Xi told Vietnam's Communist Party Secretary-General To Lam to ""jointly oppose unilateral bullying"". ""We must strengthen strategic resolve... and uphold the stability of the global free trade system as well as industrial and supply chains,"" he said. Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator, said Xi's comments were ""a very shrewd tactical move"". ""While Trump seems determined to blow up the trade system, Xi is positioning China as the defender of rules-based trade, while painting the US as a reckless rogue nation,"" he added. Speaking to reporters in the Oval office on Monday, Trump said he does not ""blame"" China or Vietnam but alleged that they were focused on how to harm the US. ""That's a lovely meeting. Meeting like, trying to figure out, how do we screw the United States of America?"" said Trump. The world's two largest economies are locked in an escalating trade battle, with the Trump administration putting tariffs of 145% on most Chinese imports earlier this month. Beijing later responded with its own 125% tariffs on American products coming into China. On Saturday, a US customs notice revealed smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices would be excluded from the 125% tariff on goods entering the country from China. But Trump later chimed in on social media saying there was no exemption for these products and called such reports about this notice false. Instead, he said that ""they are just moving to a different tariff 'bucket'"".

Watch: Bukele says he will not return Ábrego García to the US

El Salvador will not return Kilmar Ábrego García, whom the US government deported to his home country where he is being held in a mega-prison. President Nayib Bukele made the comments during a meeting on Monday at the White House with Donald Trump, with whom he shares a strong relationship. The US Supreme Court ruled last week that the Trump administration must ""facilitate"" the return of Mr Ábrego García, who was living in Maryland with his family and was granted protection from deportation by a court in 2019. The Trump administration argues it cannot bring him home, and Attorney General Pam Bondi said it is ""up to El Salvador if they want to return him"".

Trump praised Bukele for a new partnership under which the US can deport people it alleges are gang members to the Central American nation. Mr Ábrego García, whose lawyer said he is not a gang member, was among 238 Venezuelans and 23 Salvadorans the Trump administration deported to El Salvador's Center for the Confinement of Terrorism (Cecot). During Monday's visit, Trump also repeated that he wanted to deport some violent criminals who are US citizens to Salvadoran prisons if his administration determined it was legal. ""We always have to obey the laws, but we also have homegrown criminals that push people into subways, that hit elderly ladies on the back of the head with a baseball bat when they're not looking, that are absolute monsters,"" Trump told reporters. ""I'd like to include them in the group of people to get them out of the country, but you'll have to be looking at the laws on that,"" the US president added. On Sunday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said another 10 alleged gang members were sent there, despite legal challenges over those it already deported. The US considers them suspected members of the MS-13 and Tren de Aragua gangs, which are designated as ""foreign terrorist organisations"" by Trump. In response to an earlier ruling by the US Supreme Court that the administration should facilitate the release of Mr Ábrego García, lawyers wrote on Sunday that the issue was a matter of foreign policy - and outside the control of the courts. Trump told reporters last week that if the Supreme Court said ""bring somebody back, I would do that"". The justice department cited Bukele's comments that Mr Ábrego García would not be returned to the US as an update in their latest court filing.

Reuters Kilmar Ábrego García was sent to a prison in El Salvador

Mr Ábrego García's wife Jennifer Vasquez Sura, a US citizen, said the ""Trump and Bukele administrations continue to play political games with his life"". ""My heart is heavy, but I hold on to hope and the strength of those around me. For our children, our family, and all immigrants fighting for loved ones - Kilmar, we will not stop fighting for you,"" she said in a statement. The US government has conceded Mr Ábrego García was deported because of an ""administrative error"", though it also says he is a member of the MS-13 gang - something his lawyer denies. Officials were ordered to provide daily updates on steps being taken to bring Mr Ábrego García back to the US. Relations between Trump and Bukele have flourished since the US president's return to the White House in January, after Bukele agreed to take US deportees, which has helped Trump in his pledge to enact mass deportations. Writing on X, Rubio said the alliance was an ""example for security and prosperity in our hemisphere"". Ahead of Bukele's trip to Washington, Trump praised his counterpart, who has positioned himself as a tough-on-crime strongman. Trump said Bukele was doing a ""fantastic job"" at imprisoning some ""very bad people... that should never have been allowed into our country"".

Trump's team has so far sent to El Salvador more than 200 migrants, who were accused of being gang members. Many of them were removed from the country using a law that dates back to 1798. BBC Mundo was allowed to go inside Cecot, El Salvador's maximum security prison, in 2024. It is the symbol of the aggressive and controversial ""war on gangs"" waged by President Bukele since 2022. Spanning 116 hectares, the jail was built in less than a year and has the capacity to hold 40,000 inmates, according to the government. It has been widely criticised for alleged human rights abuses and lack of legal protections for prisoners. The cells have no windows or ventilation, and prisoners sleep on metal bunks without mattresses or sheets. Each cell can hold more than 150 prisoners and there are only two toilets with no privacy whatsoever. They have limited access to water, and are only allowed to go out to exercise for 30 minutes a day. Family members of some previous deportees to the prison have denied they have gang ties. One woman in Venezuela, Myrelis Casique López, recently told BBC Mundo she became certain her son was among the detainees when she saw a photo of him being taken to Cecot. She suggested he was targeted by American authorities due to his tattoos. Announcing the removal of 10 more ""criminals"" in a social media post on Sunday, Rubio did not say whether the latest group was sent to Cecot specifically. The administration previously published images of deportees arriving at the facility - and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem paid a visit last month. Asked whether he had concerns over allegations of human rights abuses at Cecot, Trump told reporters: ""I don't see it.""

Guardia Civil Ministry of Interior Police say the couple's activities were connected to a larger global trafficking organisation

Spanish authorities have arrested a couple suspected of selling exotic cats online, including protected species such as white tigers, pumas and clouded leopards. Civil Guard police raided the couple's home on the island of Majorca after learning that they were owning and breeding rare feline species which they then sold on social media. In total, 19 felines were found on the property and rescued by agents. They included a caracal, two servals and 16 hybrid felines. The Civil Guard say the discovery was just ""the tip of the iceberg of a plot"" of a global criminal organisation involving breeders, transporters and vets.

""Most of the animals offered for sale came from countries such as Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine, to be smuggled into the European Union,"" the Civil Guard said. The authorities said the couple's social media was ""extremely active"" as people from other countries contacted them to purchase these types of animals. The animals were smuggled into the EU through Poland's border with Belarus and then distributed with false documents, they added. Europe is a central hub for exotic wildlife trade and the illicit black market is on the rise, according to the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW). The couple also advertised other animals through social media including hyenas, desert lynxes and pumas.

A clouded leopard - an animal native to the Himalayas - with a price tag of €60,000 (£52,000; $68,000) was also put up for sale online. This raid was part of a wider operation which began last March. One other person is being investigated for selling various species of exotic animals on the internet. The animals have been temporarily placed at the Son Servera Safari Zoo in Majorca. They may be later relocated to a rescue centre near Alicante, although this is still under discussion. The high demand for exotic cats is fuelled by social media because the felines can be seen as a sign of wealth or status, according the IFAW. But these cats – which require a lot of space – are difficult to look after. ""They are very aggressive and can pose a danger to people or other animals"" which leads to many people getting rid of them, the Spanish Civil Guard said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8g7m54gkro,1

Watch: Blue Origin launches an all-female crew into space

Pop star Katy Perry and five other women safely returned to Earth after reaching space aboard Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin rocket. The singer was joined by Bezos's fiancée Lauren Sánchez and CBS presenter Gayle King, who said a highlight of the flight was hearing Perry sing Louis Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World"". After landing back on Earth, Perry said she felt ""super connected to life"" and ""so connected to love"". The flight lasted around 11 minutes and took the six women more than 100km (62 miles) above Earth, crossing the internationally recognised boundary of space and giving them a few moments of weightlessness.

Also on board were former Nasa rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn. The New Shepard rocket lifted off from its West Texas launch site just after 08:30 local time (14:30 BST). The capsule returned to Earth with a parachute-assisted soft landing, while the rocket booster also landed back in Texas. Cheering could be heard from inside the capsule as the recovery crew went to collect them. Jeff Bezos opened the capsule door to welcome back Lauren Sánchez, the first to disembark. ""I'm so proud of this crew,"" she said tearfully. ""I can't put it into words."" She paused, before adding: ""I looked out of the window and we got to see the moon."" ""Earth looked so quiet,"" she said, adding that it was not what she expected. ""It was quiet, but really alive."" Next out was Katy Perry, who kissed the ground and lifted a daisy to the sky - her daughter is called Daisy.

Gayle King also got on her knees and kissed the ground. ""I just want to have a moment with the ground, just appreciate the ground for just a second,"" she said. The last to get out, Kerianne Flynn, pointed at the sky and shouted: ""I went to space."" A celebrity cast had watched the launch from the ground. Speaking from the viewing platform, Khloé Kardashian said: ""I didn't realise how emotional it would be, it's hard to explain. I have all this adrenaline and I'm just standing here."" ""Whatever you dream of is in our reach, especially in today's day and age. Dream big, wish for the stars—and one day, you could maybe be amongst them,""​ she added. Oprah Winfrey spoke about her friend Gayle King, and revealed she was a nervous flier. ""I mean, for her—whew—anytime we're on a flight, she's in somebody's lap at the slightest bit of turbulence. She has real, real-world anxiety when it comes to flying. And this... this is her overcoming a wall of fear,"" she said. The spacecraft was fully autonomous, requiring no pilots, and the crew did not manually operate the vehicle. The last all-female spaceflight was over 60 years ago when Soviet Cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman to travel into space on a solo mission aboard the spacecraft Vostok 6. Since then, there have been no other all-female spaceflights but women have made numerous significant contributions. The space tourism industry is still in its infancy, so every successful launch is significant and demonstrates that these short, commercial flights can be carried out safely.

Getty Images The New Shepard rocket lifted off against the backdrop of the Van Horn hills, and lasted around 11 minutes

But some critics stress it is tourism, not space science, and professional astronauts undertake missions, including scientific research, for the benefit of humankind. ""A celebrity isn't an envoy of humankind - they go into space for their own reasons,"" Dr Kai-Uwe Schrogl, special advisor for political affairs at the European Space Agency, told BBC News. ""These flights are significant and exciting, but I think maybe they can also be a source of frustration for space scientists,"" he added. ""We see space flight as being for science, knowledge and the interests of humanity. ""Celebrities do it for amusement but get a lot more attention than the regular astronauts."" The space flight also generated a range of response on social media, from enthusiasm to hostility. Dr Tanya Harrison, from the Outer Space Institute experts network said: ""A lot of the comments that I saw on social media were things about, 'Oh, it's like the Real Housewives go to Mars' or 'It's the oligarchy in space, read the room, the timing is terrible.'"" But: ""There were a lot of positive takes as well. People were like, 'Oh, this is so cool. Katy Perry is going to space.'"" Dr Harrison, who had previously worked on Nasa missions to Mars said: ""The cynical part of me wants to call it a marketing stunt. This is a company promoting the fact they can launch tourists into space."" However she noted the all-women team might ""change the demographics a little bit of who might want to do something like this."" ""Socially, they might have had some impact"", she said. In a news conference after the flight, two of the women took issue with some of the criticism the mission had received, related for example to its cost. ""I feel that anybody who is criticising doesn't really understand what's happening here,"" said Gayle King. She said that the astronauts had had a huge, positive response from young women and young girls. Lauren Sánchez said she had got ""fired up"" about the criticism and would love to have the naysayers come to Blue Origin and see the thousands of employees who ""put their heart and soul into"" the missions.

Blue Origin is a private space company founded in 2000 by Bezos, the billionaire entrepreneur who also started Amazon. Although Blue Origin has not released full ticket prices, a $150,000 (£114,575.85) deposit is required to reserve a seat—underlining the exclusivity of these early flights. Alongside its suborbital tourism business, the company is also developing long-term space infrastructure, including reusable rockets and lunar landing systems. The New Shepard rocket is designed to be fully reusable and its booster returns to the launch pad for vertical landings after each flight, reducing overall costs. According to US law, astronauts must complete comprehensive training for their specific roles. Blue Origin says its New Shepard passengers are trained over two days with a focus on physical fitness, emergency protocols, details about the safety measures and procedures for zero gravity. Additionally, there are two support members referred to as Crew Member Seven: one provides continuous guidance to astronauts, while the other maintains communication from the control room during the mission.

The rise of space tourism has prompted criticism that it is too exclusive and environmentally damaging. Supporters argue that private companies are accelerating innovation and making space more accessible. Professor Brian Cox told the BBC in 2024: ""Our civilisation needs to expand beyond our planet for so many reasons,"" and believes that collaboration between NASA and commercial firms is a positive step. Rocket engine exhaust contains gases and particles that can affect Earth's climate and ozone layer. On its web page under the title ""Protecting our Planet"" Blue Origin claims: ""During flight, the only byproduct of New Shepard's engine combustion is water vapor with no carbon emissions."" However, Eloise Marais, a professor of Atmospheric Chemistry and Air Quality at University College London points out that water vapour too is a greenhouse gas and is a chemical that is not supposed to be in the upper layers of the atmosphere. ""It alters the chemistry of the stratosphere, depleting the ozone layer, and also forms clouds that affect climate,"" she says. Experts say that as more rockets are launched, the risks of harming the ozone layer increases.

High-cost tourism

The high cost of space tourism makes it inaccessible to most people, with these expensive missions out of reach for the majority. Critics, including actress Olivia Munn, questioned the optics of this particular venture, remarking ""there's a lot of people who can't even afford eggs,"" during an appearance on Today with Jenna & Friends.

Watch: 'You can ban us, but not the truth' - Opposition lawmakers disrupt vote targeting LGBTQ+

Hungary's parliament has backed a range of constitutional amendments which will limit the rights of LGBTQ+ people and dual nationals. The amendments, which the government says are aimed at protecting children's physical and moral development, will enable it to ban public LGBTQ+ gatherings. Hundreds gathered outside parliament to protest against the move, which rights campaigners have labelled a ""key moment in Hungary's shift toward illiberal governance"". Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose Fidesz party voted through the bill, vowed in March that an ""Easter cleanup"" of his critics was coming.

The vote passed with 140 members voting for and 21 against. The amendments will also enable the government to temporarily suspend the citizenship of any Hungarian dual nationals who are deemed a threat to the country's security or sovereignty. Fidesz has suggested that the move is aimed at those who finance ""bogus NGOs, bought politicians and the so-called independent media"" from abroad - leading some to speculate it is, in part, intended to target Hungarian-American philanthropist George Soros, whom Orban has frequently criticised. The amendments follow a law passed last month that banned LGBTQ+ pride marches on alleged grounds they are harmful to children. Orban praised the legislation at the time, saying: ""We won't let woke ideology endanger our kids.""

Spokeswoman Dr Margaret Harris told the BBC it was seeing ""attack after attack"" on hospitals and healthcare workers, and medical supplies were critically low due to Israel's blockade of the territory. On Sunday, staff at al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City said an Israeli strike had destroyed its laboratory and damaged its emergency room. They did not report any direct casualties, but said a child died due to disruption of care. The Israeli military said it hit a ""command-and-control centre"" used by Hamas to plan attacks.

The hospital is run by the Anglican Church in Jerusalem. Church of England bishops said they shared ""grief, sorrow and outrage"" with Palestinians over the attack and called on Israel to provide evidence to support its claim."" A ceasefire in Gaza ended when Israel resumed its air and ground campaign four weeks ago, saying that military pressure would force Hamas to release the hostages it is still holding.

Al-Ahli hospital was struck by two missiles around midnight on Sunday - the fifth time it has been hit since the beginning of the war. According to the Anglican Diocese of Jerusalem, the two-storey genetic laboratory was demolished and the pharmacy and emergency department buildings were damaged. Surrounding buildings were also damaged, including St Philip's Church. The diocese said the Israel military gave a 20-minute warning to hospital staff and patients to evacuate before the attack. There were no casualties as a result of the strike, but one child who had previously suffered a head injury died as a result of the rushed evacuation process, it added. Later, WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the UN agency had been told by al-Ahli's director that the emergency room, laboratory, emergency room X-ray machines, and the pharmacy were ""destroyed"". The hospital was forced to move 50 patients to other hospitals, but 40 patients in a critical condition could not be moved, he added. ""Hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law. Attacks on health care must stop. Once again we repeat: patients, health workers and hospitals must be protected."" The Israeli foreign ministry said it was a ""precise strike on a single building that was used by Hamas as a terror command and control centre"" and where there was ""no medical activity take place"". It also stressed that an ""early warning"" was issued, and that the strike was ""carried out while avoiding further damage to the hospital compound, which remained operational for continued medical treatment"". Hamas condemned the attack as a ""savage crime"" and rejected the claim that it was using the facility for military purposes.

On Monday, the Church of England's House of Bishops said in a statement they were ""dismayed that hospitals have become battlegrounds in Gaza"" and that Israel had ""yet to provide clear and compelling evidence to substantiate its claim"" that the hospital was being used by Hamas. ""Against that backdrop, we call for an independent, thorough and transparent investigation into this attack as well as the alleged misuse of the hospital."" The bishops also said that ""the extremely limited time given to staff and patients to evacuate the hospital was a further assault on fundamental human rights and basic human dignity"". WHO representative Dr Rik Peeperkorn meanwhile told the BBC that al-Ahli was now unable to receive new patients pending repairs, and that this would ""heavily impact trauma patients"". ""Al-Ahli was a key trauma hospital north of Wadi Gaza. It is the hospital with the only functional CT scanner north of Wadi Gaza,"" he said, referring to the valley that effectively divides the territory in two because it is an Israeli-designated ""no-go"" area. The charity Medical Aid for Palestinians also quoted an orthopaedic surgeon at al-Ahli as saying that the level of care the hospital could provide to the 40 remaining patients was ""quite similar to that of a hostel"". ""We are unable to perform any surgical procedures, as these patients require laboratory diagnostics, pharmacy support, and emergency referrals in case of complications - all of which have ceased entirely due to the recent attack,"" Dr Ahmed al-Shurafa said. Dr Harris warned: ""We're seeing attack after attack on hospitals, healthcare workers, ambulance workers... the very people that are relied on, who give their all to save lives. But they don't give their all to lose their lives."" On 23 March, the Israeli military struck the surgical department of Nasser hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, killing Hamas finance chief Ismail Barhoum and one other person. Hamas said Barhoum was being treated for injuries that he suffered in an earlier Israeli attack. The military denied this, saying he was in the hospital ""in order to commit acts of terrorism"". That same day, 15 emergency workers, including eight Palestinian Red Crescent paramedics, were shot and killed by Israeli troops in nearby Rafah as they responded to a report of wounded people. The Israeli military said the troops ""opened fire due to a perceived threat"" and that six of those killed were ""Hamas terrorists"", without giving evidence. The Red Crescent denied the allegation and accused Israel of a ""full-fledged war crime"". On Monday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it had received information that a ninth paramedic who had been missing since the attack was being held ""in an Israeli place of detention"".

Watch: Is the US heading into a recession? Three warning signs to watch

Donald Trump says Chinese-made smartphones and other electronics will not be exempt from tariffs - adding they are simply moving into a different levy ""bucket"". European stock markets bounced up on Monday morning after Friday's official announcement that some of these products would escape levies of up to 145%. China has called on Donald Trump to ""completely cancel"" his tariffs regime, and ""return to the right path of mutual respect"". However US officials said on Sunday that products would be subject to a ""semiconductor tariff"" instead, with Trump expected to reveal more details later.

US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the new levy would be in addition to a host of global tariffs the US imposed earlier this month, then paused for 90 days. ""We need our medicines and we need semiconductors and our electronics to be built in America,"" he added. On Saturday, a US customs notice revealed smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices would be excluded from the 125% tariff on goods entering the country from China. But Trump chimed in on social media, saying there was no exemption for these products and called such reports about this notice false. Instead, he said that ""they are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket'"". Trump added: ""We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations."" He said he would provide an update on Monday about semiconductor duties. Everyday devices such as smartphones and laptops rely on semiconductors, which are small and powerful pieces of tech that form the basic building blocks of modern computation. Trump's iPhone olive branch is a significant trade war retreat

Trump's changing tariffs leave shoppers feeling paralysed On Monday, Sony announced that it was increasing the price of its flagship games console, the PlayStation 5, by about 10% in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, citing a ""challenging economic environment"", inflation and fluctuating exchange rates. It did not announce price rises in the United States. The Chinese commerce ministry had called Trump's exemptions a ""small step"" by the US, and said that Beijing was ""evaluating the impact"" of the move. But the suggestion by Trump administration officials of plans for future levies may dampen hopes of a thaw in the two rivals' protectionist posture. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer was asked on Sunday whether there were any plans for Trump to speak with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. ""Right now we don't have any plans on that,"" he said during an appearance on CBS's Face the Nation. Trump imposed a tariff amounting to 54% on imports of products from China at the beginning of April, before escalating to the current 145% rate.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62z54gwd22o,1

Reuters Thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes and have sought aid at displacement camps like Zamzam

More than 400 people have been killed in recent attacks by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan's Darfur region, says the UN citing ""credible sources"". Last week, the RSF launched an intense ground and aerial assault on refugee camps surrounding the city of el-Fasher in an attempt to seize the last state capital in Darfur held by their rival, the Sudanese army. The two warring sides have been locked in a bloody power struggle since April 2023. This has created the world's largest humanitarian crisis and forced millions to flee their homes. The UN said it had verified 148 killings between Thursday and Saturday, but warned the toll was much higher.

Senior international officials will gather in London later to discuss the ongoing civil war in Sudan on the second anniversary of the start of the conflict. UN spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told the BBC their verification process was still ongoing and their number of those killed did not include Sunday's violence. ""Credible sources have reported more than 400 killed,"" said Ms Shamdasani. At least nine humanitarian aid workers were among those killed, the UN said. The camps that surround el-Fasher - Zamzam and Abu Shouk - provide temporary homes to more than 700,000 people, many of whom are facing famine-like conditions. In a statement released on Saturday, the RSF said it was not responsible for attacks on civilians and that scenes of killing in Zamzam were staged to discredit its forces. The following day, the group said it had completed a ""successful liberation"" of the camp from Sudan's army. The RSF accused the army of using Zamzam as ""a military barracks, and innocent civilians as human shields"". El-Fasher is the last major town in Darfur under army control and has been under siege by the RSF for a year. Sudan's brutal civil war will enter its third year on Tuesday. UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk called on all parties involved to ""renew their resolve to take meaningful steps towards resolving the conflict"".

Ahead of the conference on Tuesday in London, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced a £120m food and aid package for Sudan. He said Sudan's stability is ""vital for our national security"". The UK will co-host the talks alongside the African Union and European Union.

Algeria to expel 12 officials from French embassy,"Algeria to expel 12 French embassy officials

The latest rift comes days after tentative steps had been made to mend relations

Barrot urged Algeria to ""abandon"" the expulsions and said France was ready to ""respond immediately"" if they went ahead.

They are accused of involvement in the abduction last year of Amir Boukhors, 41, an outspoken critic of Algeria's government with an audience of more than one million people online. He had reportedly been granted asylum in France in 2023.

Jean-Noël Barrot added that it was linked to the indictment of three Algerians in France on Friday, one of whom is a consular official.

Algeria has asked 12 French embassy staff to leave the country within 48 hours, France's foreign minister has said.

Never before have French authorities arrested an employee from the Algerian consulate, and the fallout has set back recent attempts to improve relations between the two countries.

It also points to a power struggle in French politics, with some right-wing politicians accusing the presidency of pandering to Algeria, and the Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau recently threatening to quit unless President Emmanuel Macron backs a more hard-line approach.

Boukhors, also known as Amir DZ, has lived in France since 2016.

He was abducted in April 2024 in the southern suburbs of Paris and released the following day, according to his lawyer Eric Plouvier.

Plouvier told the AFP news agency that Boukhors had been ""the subject of two serious attacks, one in 2022 and another on the evening of April 29 2024"".

French media reported that he was forced into a car with a flashing light by ""fake police officers"", then released the next day in woodland without explanation.

Algerian authorities accuse the influencer of being ""a saboteur linked to terrorist groups"". The North African nation has issued nine international arrest warrants against him, accusing him of fraud and associations with terrorist organisations.

He denies the allegations. In 2022, the French courts refused attempts to extradite him to Algeria.

The case is the latest in a growing number of incidents to have exacerbated a rift between France and Algeria.

They include the arrest and imprisonment in Algeria of French-Algerian author Boualem Sansal, who was accused of undermining Algeria's territorial integrity.

Algeria recalled its ambassador from Paris last year after France backed Morocco's claim to the disputed territory of Western Sahara.

The 12 French officials asked to leave on Monday include some members of the French interior ministry, a diplomatic source told AFP.

On Monday, Barrot said: ""I am asking Algerian authorities to abandon these expulsion measures... if the decision to send back our officials is maintained, we will have no other choice but to respond immediately.""

Barrot claimed that the expulsions were a response to the indictment of three Algerian nationals on Friday in Paris - including the consular official - on charges including abduction, arbitrary detention and illegal confinement and participating in a terrorist organisation.

Algeria's foreign ministry said it had summoned French ambassador Stéphane Romatet in response to ""express its strong protest"" and called for the official's immediate release, according to the official Algerian news agency.

It added that the individual ""was arrested in public and then taken into custody without notification through the diplomatic channels"".

The ministry claimed the move was ""not a coincidence as it happens in a very specific context with the aim of stymying the process of relaunching bilateral relations"".

Tentative steps have been made to repair relations between the two nations with a phone call between French President Emmanuel Macron and President Abdelmadjid Tebboune taking place in March.

""The two presidents had a long, frank and friendly exchange on the state of bilateral relations and the tensions that have built up in recent months,"" a joint statement read.

Following an official visit to Algeria on 6 April where he met with Tebboune, Barrot said he hoped for a ""new phase"" in relations.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62xw575w9yo,1
Mcebisi Jonas: South Africa appoints special envoy to US to ease relations,"South Africa appoints special envoy to ease US relations

The US last month expelled South Africa's ambassador, Ebrahim Rasool, over remarks he had made about the Trump administration.

Jonas, a former deputy finance minister, made headlines when he made corruption allegations against a wealthy family linked to former President Jacob Zuma.

President Cyril Ramaphosa announced Mcebisi Jonas's selection, adding that he would be ""entrusted with [advancing] South Africa's diplomatic, trade and bilateral priorities"".

South Africa has appointed a special envoy to the US in an effort to ease tensions between the two countries, which have worsened since Donald Trump's return as president.

""He will lead negotiations, foster strategic partnerships and engage with US government officials and private-sector leaders to promote our nation's interests.""

Ramaphosa's office said Jonas would be ""serving as the official representative"" of the president and South Africa.

Who is Mcebisi Jonas?

Jonas has previously served as one of South Africa's four investment envoys, appointed in 2018 to help encourage foreign companies to put their money into the country.

He first came into the spotlight during his tenure as deputy finance minister when he accused the wealthy Gupta family, which had close ties to Zuma, of offering him a bribe of 600 million rand ($31.7m; £24.14m) to become finance minister.

This was one of the most shocking of a series of allegations of corruption against Zuma and the Guptas.

Jonas, who declined the offer and would later become vocal about his resistance, said this offer came just before his then boss, Nhlanhla Nene, was sacked by Zuma.

Had he accepted, Jonas at the time said that he would have been expected to remove key Treasury officials from their posts and use his position to advance the Gupta family's ""business ambitions"" - an example of what has become known in South Africa as ""state capture"".

He later said he had been told he would be killed if he ever spoke about the meeting. The Gupta family has denied the allegations, while Zuma has always denied all accusations of corruption made against him.

Nene was eventually replaced by then little-known David van Rooyen, leading to a run on the currency and national protests, before a new finance minister was appointed just days later.

Jonas currently serves as an independent non-executive chairman of the multinational telecommunications company, the MTN Group, which Ramaphosa said he will continue with alongside his appointment as special envoy.

Ramaphosa earlier this year announced he would be dispatching envoys to several countries, including the US, to explain the country's position on key issues, some of which have drawn the Trump administration's ire.

Relations between the US and South Africa, characterised by ups and downs over the years, hit rock bottom earlier this year, with Trump cutting off aid to the country, citing the new Expropriation Law, which allows the government to confiscate land without compensation in certain circumstances.

Trump, in a post over the weekend, reiterated his intention to boycott the upcoming G20 2025 Summit taking place in South Africa later this year, citing the controversial land policy as the main reason.

Trump has also condemned South Africa for taking Israel to the International Court of Justice, accusing it of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip, which Israel has denied.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7x2rnl7myo,1
Daniel Noboa: Centre-right leader wins re-election in Ecuador,"Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa wins re-election

Watch: Daniel Noboa declares re-election ""historic"" while opponent calls for a recount

Sitting centre-right President Daniel Noboa has won the run-off round of Ecuador's presidential election, meaning he will now serve a full four-year term. Noboa, who described his victory as ""historic"", has only been in power since November 2023 after winning a snap election. He has defined his presidency, so far, through a tough military crackdown on violent criminal gangs in the country, which has become the most violent in the region. His left-wing challenger, Luisa González, said she did not accept the result and claimed fraud, without providing evidence.

Reuters Luisa González addressed supporters in Quito on election night

According to figures from Ecuador's national electoral council, this is a decisive win for Noboa - with about 56% of the vote - after polls before the election suggested it was neck and neck. ""A victory of more than ten points and over 1 million votes, leaving no doubt as to who the winner is,"" he said after the result was announced. ""This has been achieved through the perseverance, the struggle, and the hard work of every member of this team,"" he added. Noboa's win means he has a mandate to continue his self-described ""war"" on criminal drug gangs, which has included militarising Ecuador's streets and prisons, and constructing new maximum-security prisons. He recently told the BBC he wanted foreign armies from places such as the US and Europe to join his fight against gangs in the country. He is hoping to change the constitution to allow foreign military bases in the country again, which were banned under the presidency of Rafael Correa - the mentor of González.

Homicides have fallen slightly during Noboa's tenure but violence remains very high. This January, more than 780 people were murdered in the country, making it one of Ecuador's bloodiest months on record. Polls before the election suggested that security was the top concern for voters. Noboa's challenge now is to prove to the country that his plan is working if he wants to avoid unrest and discontent. This means there will be pressure on him to show that violent crime is going down, as well as unemployment. Noboa's ratings fell last year, in particular after widespread drought caused extreme power cuts across the country. He has proposed investing more money in renewable energy to diversify the country's energy supply, the majority of which currently comes from hydropower. He has also signalled a desire to boost relations with the US and President Donald Trump. In February, he announced 27% tariffs on Mexican imports and also repealed his presidential decree that had granted amnesty to undocumented Venezuelan migrants in the country. His campaign was notable for its focus on young people - he is 37 - with a strong emphasis on job creation and slick social media videos. He also pledged to invest in infrastructure in the country and tackle corruption. After her defeat, González accused the electoral authorities of trampling on democracy, and demanded a recount. She would need to provide evidence of her claims for this to happen.

Ant smugglers caught with hundreds of prized insects in Kenya,"Ant smugglers caught with hundreds of prized insects in Kenya

KWS The authorities found the ants in test tubes stuffed with cotton wool

Four men have pleaded guilty in Kenya to trying to smuggle hundreds of highly sought-after ants out of the country. The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), which is more used to protecting larger creatures, such as lions and elephants, has described this as a ""landmark case"". The contraband included giant African harvester ants, which are valued by some UK dealers at up to £170 ($220) each. The case showed a ""disturbing shift in trafficking patterns - from iconic mammals to lesser-known species that are vital to ecological balance"", the KWS said.

The suspects had concealed the creatures in ""specially modified test tubes and syringes"" which would have enabled the insects to survive for two months, the KWS said. There was also a ""calculated attempt to bypass security systems"" by obscuring the contents of the tubes. Photographs of the illegal haul shared by the KWS show hundreds of these containers packed with cotton wool, each with two or three ants.

KWS The insects were destined for Europe and Asia where collectors keep them as pets, the KWS said

The exact number of insects involved is still being evaluated but KWS spokesperson Paul Udoto told the BBC this was the country's first case of ""bio-piracy"" on this scale. The four suspects – two Belgians, a Vietnamese and a Kenyan – were arrested after what the KWS has described as ""a co-ordinated, intelligence-led operation"". It is believed that the intended destinations were the exotic pet markets in Europe and Asia. The KWS said the demand for rare insect species is growing. Collectors keep them in special habitats, known as formicariums, and watch them build their colonies. The giant African harvester ant - or Messor cephalotes - is the largest of its species and can grow to around 20mm, with the queen growing up to 25mm. Pat Stanchev, the general manager of insect-dealing website Best Ants UK, said that it is their ""big and beautiful size"" that makes them attractive for those who want to keep them as pets. He does not sell the giant African harvester ant but told the BBC that he is aware of people who try to pass on illegally imported insects. In Kenya, the ants are protected by international bio-diversity treaties and their trade is highly regulated. ""This prosecution sends a strong message that Kenya will enforce compliance… and marks a significant step forward in Kenya's fight against unconventional wildlife crimes,"" the KWS said.

US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a ""good chance"" a trade deal could be reached with the UK, suggesting it would be easier to land than with other European countries due to ""a much more reciprocal relationship"".

UK business and trade minister Sarah Jones welcomed Vance's comments and said talks to secure a deal with the US were ongoing, but declined to provide a timeline on their progress.

""Nobody wants tariffs. No one wants a tariff war. We want to secure a deal with the US,"" she added.

The real question about positive comments by Vice-President JD Vance and Jones about a UK-US trade deal, is what they actually mean by the term ""deal"".

Just after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's visit to the White House in February, it was rather telling that the UK delegation referred to what was being negotiated as an ""economic deal"".

This was meant to show that this ""deal"" was not about an extensive free trade agreement, covering nearly all goods.

In Trump's first term, negotiations between the UK and US progressed fairly well up until the point controversial issues about medicine pricing and food standards emerged.

Trump's team told me back then that they were waiting to see how close the UK would remain to European Union rules after Brexit.

This time around, the ""deal"" seems to have been about science, technology and artificial intelligence cooperation in return for avoiding tariffs.

The US has wanted to talk about the UK's ""tech tax"" on mainly US digital companies, and has raised issues about the Online Safety Act.

However, there is a big problem now.

The US has now levied a 10% tax on UK imports as part of what it called its ""reciprocal tariffs"".

But there is no general problem with this trading relationship. In fact, the UK buys more from the US than the other way around.

The mood music from Washington is that this 10% tariff is not for negotiation with anyone. That is the baseline tariff that has been levied on nearly all of America's trading partners.

Mostafa, Hafiza and Manahel film as their home, el-Fasher, comes under attack

""She left no last words. She was dead when she was carried away,"" says Hafiza quietly, as she describes how her mother was killed in a city under siege in Darfur, during Sudan's civil war, which began exactly two years ago. The 21-year-old recorded how her family's life was turned upside down by her mother's death, on one of several phones the BBC World Service managed to get to people trapped in the crossfire in el-Fasher. Under constant bombardment, el-Fasher has been largely cut off from the outside world for a year, making it impossible for journalists to enter the city. For safety reasons, we are only using the first names of people who wanted to film their lives and share their stories on the BBC phones. Hafiza describes how she suddenly found herself responsible for her five-year-old brother and two teenage sisters. Their father had died before the start of the war, which has pitted the army against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and caused the world's biggest humanitarian crisis.

Hafiza Hafiza and her brother lost their mother in August 2024 when a shell hit the market where she was working

The two rivals had been allies - coming to power together in a coup - but fell out over an internationally backed plan to move towards civilian rule. Hafiza's home is the last major city controlled by the military in Sudan's western region of Darfur, and has been under siege by the RSF for the past 12 months. In August 2024, a shell hit the market where her mother had gone to sell household goods. ""Grief is very difficult, I still can't bring myself to visit her workplace,"" says Hafiza in one of her first video messages after receiving her phone, shortly after her mother's death. ""I spend my time crying alone at home."" Both sides in the war have been accused of war crimes and deliberately targeting civilians - which they deny. The RSF has also previously denied accusations from the US and human rights groups that it has committed a genocide against non-Arab groups in other parts of Darfur after it seized control of those areas. The RSF controls passage in and out the city and sometimes allows civilians to leave, so Hafiza managed to send her siblings to stay with family in a neutral area. But she stayed to try to earn money to support them. In her messages, she describes her days distributing blankets and water to displaced people living in shelters, helping at a community kitchen and supporting a breast cancer awareness group in return for a little money to help her survive. Her nights are spent alone. ""I remember the places where my mother and siblings used to sit, I feel broken,"" she adds.

Hafiza Hafiza has tried to help displaced people in el-Fasher through voluntary work, including distributing blankets and food

In almost every video 32-year-old Mostafa sent us, the sound of shelling and gunfire can be heard in the background. ""We endure relentless artillery shelling, both day and night, by the RSF,"" he says. One day, after visiting family, he returned to find his house near the city centre had been hit by shells - the roof and walls were damaged - and looters had ransacked what was left. ""Everything was turned upside down. Most houses in our neighbourhood have been looted,"" he says, blaming the RSF. While Mostafa was volunteering at a shelter for displaced people, the area came under intense attack. He kept his camera rolling as he hid, flinching at each explosion. ""There is no safe place in el-Fasher,"" he says. ""Even refugee camps are being bombed with artillery shells. ""Death can strike anyone, anytime, without warning… by a bullet, shelling, hunger or thirst.""

Mostafa's house was hit by a shell and looted

In another message, he talks about the lack of clean water, describing how people drink from sources contaminated with sewage. Both Mostafa and 26-year-old Manahel, who also received a BBC phone, volunteered at community kitchens funded by donations from Sudanese people living elsewhere. The UN has warned of famine in the city, something that has already happened at the nearby Zamzam camp, which is home to more than 500,000 displaced people. Many people cannot get to the market ""and if they go, they find high prices"", explains Manahel. ""Every family is equal now - there is no rich or poor. People can't afford the basic necessities like food.""

Manahel The meals that Manahel helps to prepare are often the only food people can get

After cooking meals such as rice and stew, they deliver the food to people in shelters. For many, it is the only meal they will have for the day. When the war started, Manahel had just finished university, where she studied Sharia and law. As the fighting reached el-Fasher, she moved with her mother and six siblings to a safer area, further away from the front line. ""You lose your home, everything you own and find yourself in a new place with nothing,"" she says. But her father refused to leave their house. Some neighbours had entrusted him with their belongings, and he decided to stay to protect them - a decision that cost him his life. She says he was killed by RSF artillery in September 2024.

Manahel Manahel and her family had to move to another house because their home was close to the front line

Since the siege began a year ago, almost 2,000 people have been killed or injured in el-Fasher, according to the UN. After sunset, people rarely leave their homes. The lack of electricity can make night-time frightening for many of el-Fasher's one million residents. People with solar power or batteries are scared to turn lights on because they ""could be detected by drones"", explains Manahel. There were times we could not reach her or the others for several days because they had no internet access. But above all these worries, there is one particular fear that both Manahel and Hafiza share if the city falls to the RSF. ""As a girl, I might get raped,"" Hafiza says in one of her messages. She, Manahel and Mostafa are all from non-Arabic communities and their fear stems from what happened in other cities that the RSF has taken, most notably el-Geneina, 250 miles (400km) west of el-Fasher.

People outside the UK can watch the documentary on YouTube.

In 2023 it witnessed horrific massacres, along ethnic lines, which the US and others say amounted to genocide. RSF fighters and allied Arab militia allegedly targeted people from non-Arab ethnic groups, such as the Massalit - which the RSF has previously denied. A Massalit woman I met in a refugee camp over the border in Chad described how she was gang-raped by RSF fighters and was unable to walk for nearly two weeks, while the UN has said girls as young as 14 were raped. One man told me how he witnessed a massacre by RSF forces - he escaped after he was injured and left for dead. The UN estimates that between 10,000 and 15,000 people were killed in el-Geneina alone in 2023. And now more than a quarter of a million people from the city - half its former population - are among those living in refugee camps in Chad. We put these accusations to the RSF but it did not respond. However, in the past it has denied any involvement in ethnic cleansing in Darfur, saying the perpetrators had worn RSF clothing to shift the blame to them. Few reporters have had access to el-Geneina since then, but after months of negotiation with the city's civil authorities, a BBC team was allowed to visit in December 2024.

Armed RSF units patrol the streets of el-Geneina

We were assigned minders from the governor's office and were only allowed to see what they wanted to show us. It was immediately clear that the RSF was in control. I saw their fighters patrolling the streets in armed vehicles and had a brief conversation with some of them, when they showed me their anti-vehicle rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launcher. It did not take long to realise how differently they viewed the conflict. Their commander insisted there were no civilians like Hafiza, Mostafa and Manahel living in el-Fasher. ""The person who stays in a war zone is participating in the war, there are no civilians, they are all from the army,"" he said. He claimed el-Geneina was now peaceful and that most of its residents - ""around 90%"" - had come back. ""Homes that were previously empty are now occupied again."" But hundreds of thousands of the city's residents are still living as refugees in Chad, and I saw many deserted and destroyed neighbourhoods as we drove around.

Our minders took us to a market in el-Geneina where shoppers said food prices had shot up

With the minders watching us, it was hard to get a true picture of life in el-Geneina. They took us to a bustling vegetable market, where I asked people about their lives. Each time I asked someone a question, I noticed them glance at the minder over my shoulder before answering that everything was ""fine"", apart from a few comments about high prices. However, my minder would often whisper in my ear afterwards, saying people were exaggerating about the prices. We ended our trip with an interview with Tijani Karshoum, the governor of West Darfur whose predecessor was killed in May 2023 after accusing the RSF of committing genocide. It was his first interview since 2023, and he maintained he was a neutral civilian during the el-Geneina unrest and did not side with anyone.

""We have turned a new page with the slogan of peace, coexistence, moving beyond the bitterness of the past,"" he said, adding that the UN's casualty figures were ""exaggerated"". Also in the room was a man who we understood to be a representative of the RSF. Karshoum's answers to nearly all my questions were almost identical, whether I was asking about accusations of ethnic cleansing or about what happened to the former governor, Khamis Abakar. Nearly two weeks after I spoke to Karshoum, the European Union imposed sanctions on him, saying he ""holds responsibility in the fatal attack"" on his predecessor and that he had ""been involved in planning, directing or committing… serious human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law, including killings, rape and other serious forms of sexual and gender-based violence, and abduction"". I followed up with him to get his response to these accusations, and he said: ""Since I am a suspect in this matter, I believe any statement from me would lack credibility."" But he stated that he ""was never part of the tribal conflict and remained at home during the clashes"" and added that he was not involved in any violations of humanitarian law. ""Accusations of killings, abductions, or rape must be addressed through an independent investigation"" with which he would co-operate, Karshoum said. ""From the start of the conflict in Khartoum, we pushed for peace and proposed well-known initiatives to prevent violence in our socially fragile state,"" he added.

Mostafa Mostafa decided it was too dangerous to stay in el-Fasher and left in November

Given the stark contrast between the narrative promoted by those in control of el-Geneina and the countless stories I heard from refugees across the border, it is hard to imagine people ever returning home. The same goes for 12 million other Sudanese people who have fled their homes and are either refugees abroad or living in camps inside Sudan. In the end, Hafiza, Mostafa and Manahel found life in el-Fasher unbearable and in November 2024 all three left the city to stay in nearby towns. With the military regaining control of the capital, Khartoum, in March, Darfur remains the last major region where the paramilitaries are still largely in control - and that has turned el-Fasher into an even more intense battlefield. ""El-Fasher has become scary,"" Manahel said as she packed her belongings. ""We are leaving without knowing our fate. Will we ever return to el-Fasher? When will this war end? We don't know what will happen.""

Actress Cate Blanchett has said she wants to quit acting to do other things, joining a long line of big Hollywood stars who gave up the red carpets for a different lifestyle. The 55-year-old is seen as one of the most talented and bankable actresses in film, but she has indicated several times in recent years that she's keen to break away from the big screen. ""My family roll their eyes every time I say it, but I mean it. I am serious about giving up acting,"" she told the Radio Times in a new interview. ""[There are] a lot of things I want to do with my life."" Speaking about her experience of being a celebrity she added: ""When you go on a talk show, or even here now, and then you see soundbites of things you've said, pulled out and italicised, they sound really loud. I'm not that person. ""I make more sense in motion - it's been a long time to remotely get comfortable with the idea of being photographed."" Her remarks echoed comments she made to BBC Radio 4's This Natural Life last year, when she said she ""absolutely loved"" acting, but also said it would be ""brilliant"" to give it up and spoke about her passion for nature and conservation. Blanchett is best known for appearing in films such as Tár, Notes on a Scandal and Elizabeth: The Golden Age, and won Oscars for her performances in Blue Jasmine and The Aviator. She wouldn't be the first successful actor to switch careers slightly later in life. Here are 10 other actors who retired from acting (including a few who came back):

1. Cameron Diaz

The US actress was one of Hollywood's biggest stars in the 90s and 00s, having made her debut at the age of 21 opposite Jim Carey in The Mask more than 30 years ago. Initially finding fame for her goofy performances in romcoms such as My Best Friend's wedding, and comedies including There's Something About Mary, Diaz went on to prove her dramatic acting chops in movies like Being John Malkovich and Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York. But she took a hiatus from Hollywood following her turn as Ms Hannigan in 2014's remake of the musical Annie, confirming her ""retirement"" in 2018. ""I was free to be [like] 'I'm a mum, I'm a wife, I'm living my life' - it was so lovely."" She said the decade she spent in retirement from acting was ""the best 10 years"" of her life. But she was eventually persuaded to return to screens earlier this year for spy thriller Back in Action with actor Jamie Foxx.

2. Daniel Day-Lewis

The Oscar-winning star, considered one of his generation's finest actors, apparently retired in 2017, but it wasn't the first time he had stepped away from the spotlight. Day-Lewis, who holds both British and Irish citizenship, has won an incredible three best actor Academy Awards for roles in My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln. Known for leaving long stretches between roles, in the 1990s Day-Lewis went into what he called ""semi-retirement"" and became a shoemaker's apprentice in Florence, Italy. He was coaxed back to acting by Martin Scorsese and his offer of the role in Gangs of New York. A statement issued through the star's agent in 2017, when he was aged 60, said he ""will no longer be working as an actor"". Again, however, that proved not to be permanent. Day-Lewis is soon to star in Anemone, the debut feature film from his son Ronan Day-Lewis. Daniel and Ronan co-wrote the script which ""explores the intricate relationships between fathers, sons and brothers, and the dynamics of familial bonds"". Whether it's a one-off due to the family connection or the start of a big return to film remains to be seen.

3. Jack Nicholson

Nicholson is one of only three actors (including Day-Lewis, above) to have won three Academy Awards for acting. Two of Nicholson's were for best actor (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and As Good As It Gets) and another for best supporting actor (Terms of Endearment). The legendary star's other famous roles include Easy Rider, The Shining, The Departed, A Few Good Men, Batman and The Departed. Although he's never formally announced he is quitting or retiring, he previously said his retreat from the spotlight was brought on by a desire to not ""be out there anymore"". His last film role was in 2010 romcom How Do You Know. But just last week, that film's director James L Brooks told Hollywood Reporter: ""I wouldn't be surprised to see Jack work again. I mean, it's been a hunk of time but I don't know. Maybe it could be the right thing. He's reading scripts all the time, I think.""

4. Greta Garbo

Legendary Swedish screen siren Greta Garbo declared in 1941 at the ripe old age of 36 that she would be taking a ""temporary"" retirement. It proved to be permanent. The Camille and Queen Christina star never appeared on film again. Always the reluctant celebrity, the reclusive actress never played the Hollywood game, refusing interviews and avoiding film premieres and other public appearances. The enigmatic star, whose famous line ""I want to be alone"" from Grand Hotel somewhat mirrored her desire in real life as well as on screen, only succeeded in increasing her mystique by stepping away from the spotlight. However, she later clarified in an interview: ""I never said: 'I want to be alone.' I only said, 'I want to be let alone! There is all the difference'."" One of the few silent movie stars to transition successfully to the ""talkies"", Garbo moved away from Hollywood to New York, where she lived until her death in 1990 at the age of 84.

5. Sean Connery

Synonymous with James Bond, the late Scottish star first found fame through modelling and body-building before landing a few small theatre and TV roles. He made his film debut in No Road Back in 1957, but playing Secret Service agent 007 in Dr No a few years later gave him his big breakthrough. He went on to star in five further Bond movies including From Russia with Love and Goldfinger. Connery appeared in numerous other films over his long career, including Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie, The Man Who Would Be King opposite Sir Michael Caine, The Untouchables (for which he won an Oscar) and The Hunt for Red October. But he would forever be wedded to 007. In 2005, however, he said he was ""fed up with the idiots"" adding there was an ""ever-widening gap between people who know how to make movies and the people who greenlight the movies."" That declaration came a couple of years after he starred in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, which many concluded was one of the main reasons for his retirement. The poorly received comic book caper was to be his final screen appearance.

6. Rick Moranis

Kids of the 80s and 90s: You know. This guy was a huge star back in the day, the comedy backbone of popular films such as Ghostbusters, Honey I Shrunk The Kids and the musical Little Shop of Horrors (Suddenly, Seymour anyone?). But then he just seemed to disappear off the face of the earth. So what happened? He began to cut back on work after his wife died of cancer in 1991 to concentrate on raising his children, with his final big screen outing being the 1997 sequel Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves. ""I'm a single parent, and I just found that it was too difficult to manage raising my kids and doing the travelling involved in making movies,"" he told USA Today in 2005. ""So I took a little bit of a break. And the little bit of a break turned into a longer break, and then I found that I really didn't miss it."" He did continue to do voiceover work, however, and Moranis was set to make a comeback in a Honey I Shrunk the Kids reboot, which sadly fell through.

7. Gene Hackman

We sadly lost this acting legend earlier this year, along with his second wife Betsy Arakawa, but the star hadn't been seen on screen for years after retiring from the profession on the advice of his heart doctor - opting for a quiet life in New Mexico. Hackman shot to fame in Bonnie and Clyde at the end of the 60s and was rarely out of work - in films like The French Connection, Mississippi Burning and Superman. He chose to bow out from acting in the political satire Welcome to Mooseport in 2004. Explaining his decision, he told Reuters that he didn't want to risk going out on a sour note. ""The business for me is very stressful. The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast,"" he said, ""and it had gotten to a point where I just didn't feel like I wanted to do it any more.""

8. Bridget Fonda

Fonda, from the famous family dynasty, is another star who quit at the height of her fame. Starring in 80s and 90s hits such as Scandal (about the Profumo Affair), Cameron Crowe's Singles, The Godfather Part III and Single White Female (everyone wanted to copy that elfin crop, not just Jennifer Jason Leigh). And then... nothing. Fonda never formally retired, she just seemed to retreat. Her last big screen appearance was in The Whole Shebang in 2001. When asked in 2023 by a reporter if she would return to acting at some point, she replied: ""I don't think so, it's too nice being a civilian."" Fair enough! Fonda's aunt Jane also quit acting in 1990 for several years, explaining later in Vogue that ""she wasn't having fun anymore"". But she later came out of retirement for the romcom movie Monster-in-Law. ""It was just a gut feeling of, Why the hell not? It'd been 15 years, and I wanted to act again.""

9. Shelley Duvall

Getty Images

Another star we sadly lost in the last year, Shelley Duval was best known for her roles in film like The Shining, Annie Hall and Nashville. Her step back from the spotlight wasn't just her choice. Movie roles began to drop off in the 90s and then she decided to move back to Texas after her brother was diagnosed with cancer. A year before her death, she told People magazine: ""It's the longest sabbatical I ever took but it was for really important reasons - to get in touch with my family again."" Duvall did return to acting in horror movie, 2023's The Forest Hills. ""Acting again - it's so much fun. It enriches your life,"" she told People. ""[Jessica Tandy] won an Oscar when she was 80. I can still win,"" she joked. Sadly, she didn't get the chance.

What Trump really wants from Canada,"What Trump really wants from Canada

20 hours ago Share Save Anthony Zurcher • @awzurcher North America correspondent Reporting from Cutler, Maine Share Save

BBC

Machias Seal Island is a tiny dot on maps of North America. But the uninhabited, fogbound rock is significant for its location in an area known as the ""Grey Zone"" – the site of a rare international dispute between Canada and the United States. The two neighbours and long-time allies have each long laid claim to the island and surrounding water, where the US state of Maine meets Canada's New Brunswick province – and with that claim, the right to catch and sell the prized local lobsters. John Drouin, a US lobsterman who has fished in the Grey Zone for 30 years, tells of the mad dash by Canadian and American fishermen to place lobster traps at the start of the summer catching season each year. ""People have literally lost parts of their bodies, have had concussions, [their] head smashed and everything,"" he says. The injuries have been caused when lobstermen have been caught up in each other's lines. He says one friend lost his thumb after it became caught up in a Canadian line, what Mr Drouin calls his battle scar from the Grey Zone.

Canada and the US have disputed the sovereignty of the 'Grey Zone' since the 1700s

The 277 square miles of sea around Machias Seal Island has been under dispute since the late 1700s – and in 1984, an international court ruling gave both the US and Canada the right to fish in the waterway. It has stood as a quirk – an isolated area of tension in what had been, until now, an otherwise close relationship between the two countries. But that could all be about to change. US President Donald Trump's return to the White House, steep tariffs on Canadian imports and rhetoric about making the country the 51st state has sparked a series of fresh flashpoints, with the possibility that he may ultimately wish to subsume Canada into the US hanging over everything. Amid the biggest shift in the relationship between the two countries in decades, the question is, what does he really want from Canada?

Lobster wars

Cutler, Maine, is the closest US town to the Grey Zone. It has a collection of scattered houses, one supply store and, for good reason, a lobster wholesaler. Aside from a few big-city retirees and holiday-goers, Cutler owes its existence to the bountiful crustaceans that inhabit the offshore waters. And for the lobstermen of Cutler, the international limbo of the Grey Zone is their everyday reality, as they scatter their traps along the bottom of the Gulf of Maine to catch the prized lobsters and bring them to market. During lobster season, the Grey Zone is packed with boats and buoys marking the location of their traps. When the waters get crowded and livelihoods are at stake, things can get ugly.

Some lobstermen, such as John Drouin (pictured in Cutler), have encountered skirmishes in the 'Grey Zone'

""Do we like it? Not in the least,"" says Mr Drouin. He has caught lobsters in the Grey Zone for 30 years. ""I will continue to complain about it until I can't breathe anymore."" Another Maine lobsterman, Nick Lemieux, said he and his sons have had nearly 200 traps stolen in recent years – and he blames their rivals to the north. ""This is our area, and it's all we have to work with,"" he said. ""Things like that don't sit very well with us."" Americans accuse the Canadians of operating under a different, more accommodating set of rules that allow them to catch larger lobsters. Canadians counter that the Americans have higher catch limits and are surreptitiously fishing in their territorial waters. The union representing Canada's border officials recently complained that Americans have responded to their enforcement efforts with threats of violence – and some of its officers have refused to work in the Grey Zone. Canada regularly dispatches maintenance workers to Machias Seal Island to check on an automated lighthouse – evidence, they say, of their control. The Americans point to US Marines who occupied the island during World War One as their proof of sovereignty.

A series of border disputes

The dispute appears to be going nowhere, but during Trump's first presidency, events in the Grey Zone did not appear to be intruding greatly on the overall warmth between the US and Canada. When Trump hosted Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the White House in 2017, he spoke about the US-Canada relationship in glowing terms, remarking on the ""special bonds"" between the two nations that ""share much more than a border"". Yet his rhetoric has since changed sharply.

Getty Images Canada sends workers to maintain the lighthouse on Machias Seal Island and says this is an indication of its sovereignty

In recent months, Trump has repeatedly called Canada the ""51st state"" of the US – and the White House has expressed a willingness to open up new areas of dispute all along the US-Canada border. In September, the president voiced designs on Canadian water in British Columbia in the west of the country, for instance, suggesting it could be piped to drought-parched California: ""You have millions of gallons of water pouring down from the north… they have essentially a very large faucet"". Approximately 1,500 miles further east, the Great Lakes could become another site of potential conflict, as US officials told their Canadian counterparts they are considering withdrawing from treaties over their coordinated environmental regulation. And even further east, a library has become the unlikely setting for a flashpoint: built deliberately to straddle the Vermont-Quebec border as a symbol of cooperation between Canada and the US, the Haskell Free Library and Opera House used to be open to residents from both nations. However in March, America changed the rules so that Canadians are required to pass through immigration control before they access the building, with the US Department of Homeland Security claiming it was in response to drug trafficking.

Battle for natural resources

Natural resources are another source of dispute. Canada has vast supplies of rare earth metals, gold, oil, coal and lumber – the kind of natural wealth that Trump has long prized. While Trump has disavowed any desire for Canada's lumber, energy stockpiles or manufactured products, in February Trudeau reportedly told a closed-door meeting of Canadian business and labour leaders that he saw it differently. ""I suggest that not only does the Trump administration know how many critical minerals we have but that may even be why they keep talking about absorbing us and making us the 51st state. They're very aware of our resources, of what we have, and they very much want to be able to benefit from those,"" the CBC quoted Trudeau as saying. Jordan Heath-Rawlings, a Canadian journalist and host of The Big Story podcast, believes Trump wants Canadian resources, and that the president's annexation comments should be taken seriously. ""He likes the idea of being the guy to bring in a huge land mass,"" says Mr Heath-Rawlings. ""He probably wants the Arctic, which is obviously going to become much more valuable in the years to come.""

Getty Images Canadians have already been boycotting US products and cancelling holidays there

For Trump, even the US-Canadian border itself is suspect. ""If you look at a map, they drew an artificial line right through it between Canada and the US,"" he said in March. ""Somebody did it a long time ago, and it makes no sense."" Needless to say, Trump's comments have rankled Canadian leaders, who warn of the president's ultimate designs on their homeland. In March, Trudeau accused the US president of planning ""a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us"". The previous month, after Trump first announced new tariffs on Canada, Trudeau had said: ""Trump has it in mind that one of the easiest ways of doing that [annexing Canada] is absorbing our country. And it is a real thing."" If US territorial ambitions for Canada are, in fact, a ""real thing"", it presents a simple, vexing question. Why? Why would the US, which has had the closest of diplomatic, military, economic and cultural ties with its northern neighbour for more than a century, put all of that at risk?

Exception rather than the norm

Some see a pattern in Trump's designs on Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal – one that reflects a dramatic change in how the US sees itself in the world. It has been most clearly articulated by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said in January that the post-World War Two dominance of the US was more the exception than the norm. ""Eventually you were going to reach back to a point where you had a multi-polar world, multiple great powers in different parts of the planet,"" he said. ""We face that now with China and to some extent Russia, and … rogue states like Iran and North Korea."" According to Michael Williams, professor of international affairs at the University of Ottawa, if the current Trump administration thinks that American world dominance is no longer possible or even desired, the US might pull back from far-flung conflicts and European commitments. Instead, says Prof Williams, the US would prioritise its ""territorial core"", creating a continental fortress of sorts, insulated on both sides by the vastness of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. ""If this is your plan, you seek to control key geographic choke points,"" he says. ""You maximise access to natural resources, of which Canada has plenty, and you reshore industry whenever possible.""

Getty Images Mark Carney recently said that the long-standing relationship Canada had with the US is now over

Such a geopolitical outlook is hardly new. In the 1820s, US President James Monroe articulated a new global order in which America and Europe confined themselves to their own hemispheres. But it does represent a remarkable shift in US foreign policy since the end of World War Two.

A plan or a whim?

Prof Williams acknowledges that it's difficult to figure out exactly what the US president is thinking – a view wholeheartedly endorsed by John Bolton, who served as Trump's national security adviser for more than a year of his first presidential term. ""Trump has no philosophy,"" he says. ""He gets ideas, but does not follow a coherent pattern. There is no underlying strategy."" The president is currently fixated on minerals and natural resources, he said, but Mr Bolton argues the best way to go about doing that is through the private sector, not by floating the idea of annexing an ally. Canada, for its part, has offered to work with US companies on joint mining partnerships. Prof Williams and Mr Bolton agree that whatever the motivations behind Trump's designs on Canada, the diplomatic damage that's being done will be difficult to undo – and the possibility of unanticipated consequences is high.

Boycotts and cancelled trips

""Trump likes to say in a lot of contexts that other people don't have any cards,"" says Prof Williams. ""But the further you push people to the wall, the more you may find that they have cards that you didn't know they had – and they might be willing to play them. And even if you have more cards, the consequences of doing so can easily spiral out of control in some really bad ways."" Canadians have already been boycotting US products and cancelling winter trips south, which has had an impact on tourist communities in Florida. ""We're not looking for a fight, but Canada's ready for one,"" says Mr Heath-Rawlings. The idea that the trust between the US and Canada has been broken is one that's been embraced by the country's new prime minister, Mark Carney, as a general election looms. ""The old relationship we had with the United States based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation is over,"" he said recently. ""I reject any attempts to weaken Canada, to wear us down, to break us so that America can own us."" Back in the 19th Century, territorial conflicts and flare-ups along the US-Canada border were a more frequent occurrence. Americans made multiple unsuccessful attempts to capture Canadian territory during the 1812 War. In 1844, some Americans called for military force if the UK wouldn't agree to its claims in the Pacific Northwest. The 1859 ""pig dispute"" involved contested islands near Vancouver and the unfortunate shooting of a British hog that had intruded on an American's garden. All that seemed the stuff of dusty history books, where the Grey Zone was a diplomatic oddity – an exception to a peaceful norm in the modern world of developed and integrated democracies. But that calm is now broken, and no one is sure where these stormy waters will lead either country.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15vl99dw0do,1
Afghanistan: Girls driven to low-paid carpet weaving after school ban,"The Taliban banned Afghan girls from school. Low-paid carpet weaving is now their lifeline

14 hours ago Share Save Mahjooba Nowrouzi BBC Afghan Service Reporting from Kabul Share Save

BBC Carpet weaving is one of few professions open to women since the Taliban government took power in 2021

At a workshop in Kabul where carpets are made, hundreds of women and girls work in a cramped space, the air thick and stifling. Among them is 19-year-old Salehe Hassani. ""We girls no longer have the chance to study,"" she says with a faltering smile. ""The circumstances have taken that from us, so we turned to the workshop."" Since the Taliban seized power in 2021, girls over the age of 12 have been barred from getting an education, and women from many jobs. In 2020, only 19% of women were part of the workforce - four times less than men. That number has dropped even further under Taliban rule. The lack of opportunities, coupled with the dire economic situation the country faces, have pushed many into long, laborious days of carpet weaving - one of the few trades the Taliban government allows women to work in.

According to the UN, the livelihoods of about 1.2 to 1.5 million Afghans depend on the carpet weaving industry, with women making up nearly 90% of the workforce. In an economy that the UN warned in a 2024 report had ""basically collapsed"" since the Taliban took power, the carpet export business is booming. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce noted that in the first six months of 2024 alone, over 2.4 million kilograms of carpets - worth $8.7m (£6.6m) - were exported to countries such as Pakistan, India, Austria and the US. But this has not necessarily meant better wages for the weavers. Some the BBC spoke to said they had seen none of the profit from a piece sold in Kazakhstan last year that fetched $18,000.

Nisar Ahmad Hassieni employs about 600 women across three workshops

Within Afghanistan, carpets sell for far less - between $100-$150 per square metre. Needing money to help support their families and having few options for employment, workers are trapped in low-paid labour. Carpet weavers say they earn about $27 for each square metre, which usually takes about a month to produce. That is less than a dollar a day despite the long, gruelling shifts that often stretch to 10 or 12 hours. Nisar Ahmad Hassieni, head of the Elmak Baft company, who let the BBC go inside his workshops, said that he pays his employees between $39 and $42 per square metre. He said they are paid every two weeks, with an eight-hour workday. The Taliban has repeatedly said that girls will be allowed to return to school once its concerns, such as aligning the curriculum with Islamic values, are resolved - but so far, no concrete steps have been taken to make that happen. Mr Hassieni said that, following the rise of the Taliban government, his organisation made it its mission to support those left behind by the closures. ""We established three workshops for carpet weaving and wool spinning,"" he says. ""About 50-60% of these rugs are exported to Pakistan, while the rest are sent to China, the USA, Turkey, France, and Russia to meet customer demand.""

Many of the weavers were forced out of education or professional careers

Shakila, 22, makes carpets with her sisters in one of the rooms of the modest rental they also share with their elderly parents and three brothers. They live in the impoverished Dasht-e Barchi area, in the western outskirts of Kabul. She once had dreams of becoming a lawyer, but now leads her family's carpet-making operation. ""We couldn't do anything else,"" Shakila tells me. ""There weren't any other jobs"". She explains how her father taught her to weave when she was 10 and he was recovering from a car accident. What began as a necessary skill in times of hardship has now become the family's lifeline. Shakila's sister, 18-year-old Samira, aspired to be a journalist. Mariam, 13, was forced to stop going to school before she could even begin to dream of a career. Before the Taliban's return, all three were students at Sayed al-Shuhada High School. Their lives were forever altered after deadly bombings at the school in 2021 killed 90 people, mostly young girls, and left nearly 300 wounded. The previous government blamed the Taliban for the attack, though the group denied any involvement. Fearing another tragedy, their father made the decision to withdraw them from school.

UK conference on Sudan fails to set up contact group for ceasefire talks,"A British-led attempt to establish a contact group to facilitate ceasefire talks in Sudan fell apart on Tuesday when Arab states refused to sign a joint communique after a conference in London.

The daylong argument between Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over the communique represents a big diplomatic setback for efforts to end two years of civil war in Sudan.

Hundreds of civilians have been killed in two major refugee camps in Darfur in recent days, and millions have been displaced by the fighting. TheForeign Office said it was saddened that agreement on a political way forward had not been reached, but insisted progress had been made.

In the absence of a final communique, the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, and his counterparts from France, Germany, the African Union and the EU issued a joint co-chairs’ statement pledging to support “efforts to find a peaceful solution and reject all activities, including external interference, that heighten tensions or that prolong or enable fighting”.

The statement also called for a solution that did not lead to Sudan’s partition.

Lammy had opened the conference with high hopes. “Many have given up on Sudan. That is wrong,” he said. “It’s morally wrong when we see so many civilians beheaded, infants as young as one subjected to sexual violence, more people facing famine than anywhere else in the world.

“We simply cannot look away. And as I speak, civilians and aid workers in El Fasher and Zamzam IDP camp are facing unimaginable violence.

“The biggest obstacle is not a lack of funding or texts at the United Nations, it’s lack of political will. Very simply, we have got to persuade the warring parties to protect civilians, to let aid in and across the country, and to put peace first.”

His effort to persuade the Arab states to agree a set of diplomatic principles for a future contact group did not, however, bear fruit.

Officials had said the conference did not constitute an attempt at mediation or aid-pledging, but instead intended to build greater political coherence about Sudan’s future among the many countries that have claimed a stake in the country.

In a measure of the expanding, intractable and externally fuelled nature of the war, Lammy chose not to invite any of the principal Sudanese actors or members of civilian society. The conference’s objectives are set modestly at seeking agreement on an African Union-led international contact group, and renewed commitments to end restrictions on aid.

The war, which erupted in April 2023, stemmed from a power struggle between the army – led by Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan – and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti.

The aim of establishing a contact group had been to persuade Middle Eastern states to focus on diplomacy rather than strengthening the warring factions. But from the start officials struggled to find neutral wording that Egypt and the United Arab Emirates could accept on Sudan’s future.

Sudan and others have long accused the UAE of arming the RSF – which it strenuously denies – while Egypt has maintained close ties with the Sudanese army.

Sudan’s government criticised the conference organisers for excluding it from the meeting while inviting the UAE.

The UAE minister for political affairs, Lana Nusseibeh, who attended the conference, said both sides were committing atrocities and condemned the recent RSF attacks on displacement camps. She called for an unconditional ceasefire, the end to unconscionable obstruction of humanitarian aid, and a transition to an independent civilian-led government.

The army and the RSF have both been accused of committing atrocities in the course of the war, which has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced 13 million, and pushed large parts of the country into famine.

Two refugee camps in Darfur, the site of a genocide in the 2000s, were captured in the past few days by the RSF as it seeks to take El Fasher, the only major population centre in Darfur not under its control.

Lammy also announced an extra £120m in humanitarian aid from the depleted UK Foreign Office aid budget, enough to help deliver food to 650,000 people. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, released a further €125m (£105m) for Sudan and neighbouring states.

At a separate event on Tuesday morning, aid and human rights groups called on the international community to punish the vast array of countries accused of either directly or indirectly sending arms to the warring parties in breach of a UN arms embargo.

“The international community will have utterly failed if we have a conference today including those actively involved in the conflict and nothing comes from it again,” said Yasmine Ahmed, the UK director of Human Rights Watch. “We need a coalition of states with the UK and the co-hosts at the front ready to say we are galvanising the necessary political momentum to protect civilians on the ground.

“It is necessary that it is made clear that this cannot continue. The international community cannot sleepwalk into another genocide. They have international obligations to protect and respect international law.”

Also speaking before the conference, Kate Ferguson, a co-director of Protection Approaches, said: “The conference is a test of the kind of foreign secretary Lammy will be in a world full of chaos, crisis and violence, and where the US leadership is lacking.” She added: “Lammy needs to be unambiguous about the UK’s position, and unapologetic. The conference must confront and seek immediately to halt the unfolding genocide in Darfur.”

However, neither side seems interested in discussing peace, and some fear the country is heading for a form of partition based around the current areas of control.

The meeting comes against the backdrop of US cuts to its aid programme.

Kate Phillips-Barrasso, a vice-president of global policy at the aid group Mercy Corps, said the nature of the US cuts meant it was hard to know how badly Sudan had been affected, but in her agency’s case, a lifeline for 220,000 people had been cut.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/15/uk-conference-hopes-to-map-pathway-to-end-suffering-in-sudan,1
France expels 12 Algerian officials as row over alleged kidnapping escalates,"France has expelled 12 Algerian consular and diplomatic officials and recalled its ambassador in Algiers, the French presidency said on Tuesday, in a retaliatory measure as a spat escalates between the two countries.

“The Algerian authorities are responsible for the sudden degradation of our bilateral relations,” President Emmanuel Macron’s office said.

Algiers has been protesting against France’s detention of an Algerian consular agent suspected of involvement in the kidnapping of an Algerian opposition activist. France later said Algeria had expelled 12 of its diplomatic staff.

France’s relations with its former colony have long been complicated, but took a turn for the worse last year when Macron supported Morocco’s position over that of Algeria over the disputed Western Sahara region.

Last week the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, had said that ties between the two countries were returning to normal.

The activist and influencer Amir Boukhors is a critic of the Algerian president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, and has more than 1 million subscribers on TikTok, where he posts as Amir DZ.

He has lived in France since 2016 and was granted political asylum in 2023. Algeria has issued nine international arrest warrants against him on accusations of fraud and terrorism, but France refuses to extradite him.

In April 2024, Boukhors was snatched outside his home in Val-de-Marne, south of Paris, telling France 2 television in a later interview that he was handcuffed and bundled into a car by four men wearing police armbands. He claimed he was drugged and held in a “container” for more than 24 hours before being released at 3am. “I fell into a trap,” he said.

Three men were arrested and put under investigation on Friday for the “kidnap, holding and arbitrary detention” of Boukhors. France’s national anti-terrorist prosecutor confirmed that one of the men arrested worked for the Algerian consulate at Créteil, south-east of Paris.

Algeria has denied the official’s involvement in the kidnapping.

In a separate source of tension between the countries, Macron has also called on Algeria to release Boualem Sansal, a 75-year-old writer sentenced to five years in prison for “undermining the integrity” of the country.

Sudan in ‘world’s largest humanitarian crisis’ after two years of civil war,"Sudan is suffering from the largest humanitarian crisis globally and its civilians are continuing to pay the price for inaction by the international community, NGOs and the UN have said, as the country’s civil war enters its third year.

The UK is hosting ministers from 20 countries in London on Tuesday in an attempt to restart stalled peace talks. However, diplomatic efforts have often been sidelined by other crises, including the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.

Two years to the day since fighting erupted in Khartoum between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, hundreds of people were feared to have died in RSF attacks on refugee camps in the western Darfur region in the latest apparent atrocity of a war marked by its brutality and wide-scale humanitarian impact.

The consequences for Sudan’s 51 million people have been devastating. Tens of thousands are reportedly dead. Hundreds of thousands face famine. Almost 13 million people have been displaced, 4 million of those to neighbouring countries.

“Sudan is now worse off than ever before,” said Elise Nalbandian, Oxfam’s regional advocacy manager. “The largest humanitarian crisis, largest displacement crisis, largest hunger crisis … It’s breaking all sorts of wrong records.”

There were “massive-scale” violations of international humanitarian law in the conflict, said Daniel O’Malley, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross delegation in Sudan. “All of the civilian population, irrespective of where they are in the country, have basically been trapped between one, two or more parties. And they have been bearing the brunt of everything. The sheer numbers are just mind-boggling.”

Last month, Sudan’s military recaptured the highly symbolic presidential palace in Khartoum and it has retaken most of the capital. But in much of the country, the conflict rages on. Sources cited by the UN reported that more than 400 people had been killed in recent attacks by the RSF in Darfur, where the group is trying to seize El Fasher, the last state capital in the region not under its control.

Since late last week, the RSF has launched ground and aerial assaults on El Fasher itself and the nearby Zamzam and Abu Shouk displacement camps. A UN spokesperson told Agence France-Presse that the UN’s rights office had verified 148 killings and received reports from “credible sources” that the total number of dead exceeded 400.

Reuters reported that data from the UN’s International Organization for Migration suggested that up to 400,000 people had been displaced from the Zamzam camp alone since the weekend.

In a statement the UN rights chief, Volker Türk, said the “large-scale attacks … made starkly clear the cost of inaction by the international community, despite my repeated warnings of heightened risk for civilians in the area”.

He added: “The attacks have exacerbated an already dire protection and humanitarian crisis in a city that has endured a devastating RSF siege since May last year.”

El Fasher is one of several areas of Darfur where a famine, affecting about 637,000 people, has been declared. Almost half the 50-million population of Sudan – 24.6 million people – do not have enough food.

Leni Kinzli, the World Food Programme’s head of communications for Sudan, said the other conflicts, as well as a lack of access for journalists, and Sudan’s relative international isolation since the days of the regime of the ousted dictator Omar al-Bashir all meant Sudan was not getting the attention it needed.

“We don’t see the level of international attention on Sudan as we do for other crises,” she said. “There should not be a competition between crises. But unfortunately we’re seeing with everything going on in the world, other conflicts, other humanitarian crises and other things making headlines, that unfortunately Sudan is – I wouldn’t even call it forgotten – it’s ignored.”

The origins of the war can be traced to late 2018, when popular protests broke out against the Sudanese dictator Bashir. Sudan’s army leader, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, allied with the RSF chief, Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, a former warlord known as Hemedti, to oust Bashir in a coup in April 2019.

They then allied again in 2021 to depose a civilian government meant to transition Sudan to a democracy. However, Hemedti had long coveted ultimate power for himself, and the friction between the two spiralled into full-on war less than two years later.

The RSF, a paramilitary force that grew out of the Janjaweed Arab militias accused of committing genocide in the Darfur region in the mid-2000s, made rapid gains in the first weeks and months, as the fighting spread beyond Khartoum.

In Darfur thousands of people died in the first year of the war, in well-documented attacks by the RSF and allied militias on non-Arab Masalit and other ethnic groups. Masalit refugees who had fled west to Chad recounted women and girls being targeted for gang rapes and boys shot in the street. Militia fighters said they would force women to have “Arab babies”, according to a UN report released in November 2024.

The RSF and the army have both been accused of committing war crimes in the course of the conflict.

In January of this year the US formally declared that the RSF had committed genocide, marking the second time in less than 30 years that genocide had been perpetrated in Sudan.

The United Arab Emirates has been accused of fuelling the conflict by arming the RSF. Emirati passports allegedly found on the battlefield last year point to potential covert boots on the ground.

Leaked UN experts report raises fresh concerns over UAE’s role in Sudan war,"Pressure is mounting on the United Arab Emirates over its presence at a crucial conference in London aimed at stopping the war in Sudan after a leaked confidential UN report raised fresh questions over the UAE’s role in the devastating conflict.

The UAE has been accused of secretly supplying weapons to Sudanese paramilitaries via neighbouring Chad, a charge it has steadfastly denied.

However an internal report – marked highly confidential and seen by the Guardian – detected “multiple” flights from the UAE in which transport planes made apparently deliberate attempts to avoid detection as they flew into bases in Chad where arms smuggling across the border into Sudan has been monitored.

The allegations raise complications for the British foreign secretary, David Lammy, who controversially invited the UAE alongside 19 other states for Sudan peace talks at Lancaster House on 15 April.

The date marks the second anniversary of a civil war that has caused the world’s biggest humanitarian crisis, displacing more than 12 million people.

A senior diplomat, who is familiar with the leaked report but requested anonymity, said: “The UK needs to explain how it is responding to massacres of children and aid workers while hosting the UAE at its London conference.”

The 14-page report – completed last November and sent to the Sudan sanctions committee of the UN Security Council – was written by a panel of five UN experts who “documented a consistent pattern of Ilyushin Il-76TD cargo flights originating from the United Arab Emirates” into Chad, from where they identified at least three overland routes potentially used for transporting weapons into neighbouring Sudan.

They found that the cargo flights from airports in the UAE to Chad were so regular that, in effect, they had created a “new regional air bridge”.

They noted that flights demonstrated peculiarities, with planes often disappearing for “crucial segments” of their journey, a pattern that the experts said “raised questions of possible covert operations”.

However, the experts added that they could not identify what the planes were carrying or locate any evidence that the planes were transporting weapons.

3:22 Khartoum before and after: footage shows destruction wreaked by war in Sudan – video

The findings of numerous cargo flights from the UAE to Chad are not mentioned in the final report of the UN expert panel on Sudan, due to be published in a few days. No reference is made to the Emirates in the expert’s final 39-page report except in relation to peace talks.

Questions over the UAE’s alleged role in backing the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) arrive after a weekend that saw its fighters kill more than 200 civilians in a wave of violence against vulnerable ethnic groups in displacement camps and around the city of El Fasher, the last major city still held by the Sudanese army in Darfur, the vast western region of Sudan.

“It will be shameful if the conference does not deliver concrete civilian protection in the context of ongoing genocide,” said the diplomat.

In January the US formally declared that the RSF had committed genocide in Sudan.

The UAE states that it is committed to bringing “lasting peace“ to Sudan.

In their November update, the UN experts, investigating the possible smuggling of weapons from Chad into Darfur in possible violation of an arms embargo, identified at least 24 Ilyushin Il-76TD cargo flights landed at Amdjarass airport in Chad last year.

The flights, they noted, coincided with an escalation of fighting in El Fasher, in particular a “surge in drone activity primarily by the RSF for combat and intelligence” whose arrival in Sudan, said the experts, marked “a new technological phase in the conduct of hostilities”.

Some of the flights identified in the report were linked to operators previously connected to “military logistics and illicit arms transfers”. Two of them, said the experts, had previously been flagged for violations of the arms embargo.

Experts also examined “regular departures” into Chad from two UAE airports – in Ras Al-Khaimah emirate and Al Ain in Abu Dhabi emirate – and found that the flights frequently disappeared from radars during crucial moments.

On one occasion, the report describes how a flight “left Ras Al-Khaimah, vanished mid-flight, and later surfaced in N’Djamena [capital of Chad] before returning to Abu Dhabi”.

Crucially, however, the UN experts said they could not prove that the planes were carrying weapons because the “flights lacked evidence regarding the specific content being transported”.

Four of the five UN experts said that although the flights “marked an important new trend”, what they managed to uncover “failed to meet evidentiary standards regarding evidence of arms transfers”.

For instance, although residents of the South Darfur city of Nyala reported “cargo plane activity and informants attributed it to RSF logistical operations, further triangulated evidence to confirm the nature of the cargo transported was absent”.

Therefore, the experts said, it was “premature to infer that these flights were part of an arms transfer network”. They also added that the fact that several of the flights and cargo operators were linked to military logistics and past arms violations “did not provide proof of current arms transfers”.

It added: “Additionally, patterns and anomalies in flight paths, such as mid-flight radar disappearances and unrecorded take-offs, raised concerns but did not offer verified evidence directly linking these flights to arms shipments.”

It said “closing these investigative gaps was crucial”.

The revelations come days after the international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague heard a case brought by Sudan accusing the UAE of being “complicit in the genocide” during the war. The ICJ has heard claims that the RSF is responsible for serious human rights violations including mass killings, rape and forced displacement in West Darfur.

The UAE has said the case is a cynical publicity stunt and a “platform to launch false attacks against the UAE”.

A UAE source pointed out that the confidential UN expert report contained the disclaimer that four of the five panel members felt that “allegations of an airbridge from the UAE to Sudan via Chad failed to meet the evidentiary standards required to establish a clear link between the documented flights and the alleged transfer of arms”.

A UAE statement added that the imminent final report from the Sudan expert panel did not reference the Emirates in relation to any flights “because the allegations against us failed to meet the panel’s evidentiary threshold. The record speaks for itself.”

It added that they had been told by the UN security council’s Sudan sanctions committee that the final report “did not make any negative findings” against them.

“The latest UN panel of experts report makes clear that there is not substantiated evidence that the UAE has provided any support to RSF, or has any involvement in the conflict,” said the statement.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/apr/14/leaked-un-experts-report-raises-fresh-concerns-over-uaes-role-in-sudan-war,1
Sudan’s news blackout stokes fear and confusion after attack on Zamzam camp,"Sudan’s information blackout has left relatives of those in Sudan’s Zamzam camp for those displaced by the war struggling for news of their safety after it was overrun by militiamen at the weekend.

As leaders across the globe prepared to meet for peace talks in London to pressure the backers of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudanese army to agree a ceasefire, the RSF launched a deadly assault, seizing Zamzam after weeks of tightening its siege.

The UN’s migration agency, the IOM, said between 60,000 and 80,000 households had been displaced from Zamzam following the attacks. The medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières said its team at Tawila, another displacement camp near El Fasher in Darfur, had seen about 10,000 people arrive in 48 hours suffering from dehydration and exhaustion.

Campaigners said the dearth of information on the violence, which has reportedly killed hundreds of civilians, highlighted the need for the London talks to prioritise restoring communications to allow communities under attack to warn each other, to give better access to healthcare and to facilitate human rights documentation.

Altahir Hashim, whose family was living in Zamzam, said: “Zamzam as an IDP [internally displaced persons] camp no longer exists. The RSF has completely overrun the camp – killing, raping, burning and committing all kinds of atrocities. The communications are really bad and I haven’t been able to speak to my family.”

On Friday, nine medical workers from the aid organisation Relief International were killed when the RSF raided Zamzam, while the Sudanese American Physicians Association (Sapa), said the manager of a children’s health centre was also killed.

For two decades Zamzam has hosted people displaced during the 2000s in attacks by the army and the Janjaweed militias – who were later formalised into the RSF – but its population has grown to about 700,000 during the current civil war as people have fled other parts of the Darfur region.

Hashim is part of a group of Darfuris abroad who have raised funds to buy and airdrop satellite phones into Darfur as well as walkie-talkies to allow local communication during emergencies.

He said the communications blackout also made it difficult for people to receive money sent from relatives abroad through mobile banking systems.

The limited information that has emerged from Zamzam has often relied on satellite communications – whether through imagery, phones or the Starlink service, which uses satellites rather than land-based communication towers to provide internet.

But these services can be unreliable and are costly, meaning that while they are used by some activists in Darfur, others remain unable to be contacted.

One video shared by the group North Darfur Observatory for Human Rights showed people fleeing Zamzam with their belongings strapped to camels and donkeys.

2:16 Footage shows people fleeing Zamzam with their belongings strapped to camels and donkeys – video

Often the main source of information from Darfur has come from videos recorded by RSF fighters themselves of the atrocities and some have emerged showing their fighters entering Zamzam on pickup trucks mounted with heavy machine guns with burning buildings in the background.

Shayna Lewis, from the US-based organisation Preventing & Ending Mass Atrocities (Paema).“We have reports of civilians being hunted and executed in the streets of Zamzam, but we are unable to consistently communicate with people as the networks are off and the internet can only be accessed through Starlink access points. Starlink access is sporadic, expensive and can be turned off by the belligerents at will.”

Paema said the talks in London should prioritise restoring communications as a way to quickly relieve suffering in Sudan.

Sapa, which operates medical facilities in El Fasher, said the last message it received from its teams in Zamzam on Sunday afternoon was: “Zamzam under the control of the RSF.”

Khalid Mishain, of the Sudanese human rights group Youth Citizens Observers Network, said they had lost contact with their observers in the area since the attack. He said the communications blackout had been a impediment to human rights documentation throughout the conflict.

“People have to write the information down, keep it with them and then secretly move to areas where there is communications and send it to us,” said Mishain.

“We have civilians suffering and no one knows about it, and those who report on it have to risk their life because of the communications blackout.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/apr/14/sudan-war-rsf-news-blackout-fear-confusion-refugees-idp-zamzam-camp-massacre,1
France considers response after Algeria expels 12 embassy staff,"France is considering its response after Algeria ordered the expulsion of 12 embassy staff over the arrest of an Algerian consulate official in Paris over alleged involvement in the kidnap of a TikTok influencer.

Algiers has given the French representatives 48 hours to leave the country in a move that has stretched already strained relations between the two countries to breaking point. The French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, has warned that if the expulsions go ahead Paris would be forced to respond immediately.

The influencer, Amir Boukhors, 41, is a critic of the Algerian president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, and has more than a million subscribers on TikTok where he posts as Amir DZ. He has lived in France since 2016 and was granted political asylum in 2023. Algeria has issued nine international arrest warrants against him on accusations of fraud and terrorism but France refuses to extradite him.

In April 2024, Boukhors was snatched outside his home in the Val-de-Marne, south of Paris, telling France 2 television in a later interview that he was handcuffed and bundled into a car by four men wearing police armbands. He claimed he was drugged and held in a “container” for more than 24 hours before being released at 3am. “I fell into a trap,” he said.

Three men were arrested and put under investigation on Friday for the “kidnap, holding and arbitrary detention” of Boukhors. France’s national anti-terrorist prosecutor confirmed that one of the men arrested works for the Algerian consulate at Créteil, south-east of Paris.

Algeria’s ordering of the expulsion of French embassy staff came a week after Barrot concluded an official visit to Algeria where he met Tebboune.

“I ask the Algerian authorities to stop these expulsion measures that have no link to an ongoing legal case,” he said on Monday. “If the decision to expel our staff is maintained we will have no other choice than to respond immediately.”

AFP reported that among the embassy staff ordered to leave the country were a number of members attached to France’s interior ministry whose minister, Bruno Retailleau, has taken a hard line against the former French colony.

Bilateral relations between Paris and Algiers have been tense since last July when France supported a Moroccan plan to grant autonomy to the western Sahara against Algerian-backed insurgents who want full independence for the disputed territory. Paris has accused Algeria of refusing to take back its nationals ordered to leave France and considered a security threat. In retaliation, France has threatened to slash the number of visas given to Algerians.

Emmanuel Macron has also called on Algeria to release writer Boualem Sansal, 75, sentenced to five years in prison for “undermining the integrity” of the country.

Algeria has denied the official’s involvement in Boukhors’ kidnapping and after his arrest summoned France’s ambassador, Stéphane Romatet, to express its displeasure at the consular official being arrested “in the public street … without any notification via diplomatic channels”.

Ex-Peru president Ollanta Humala given 15-year sentence for money laundering,"A Peruvian court has sentenced former president Ollanta Humala and his wife, Nadine Heredia, to 15 years in prison for laundering funds received from the Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht to finance Humala’s 2006 and 2011 campaigns.

The judges of the national superior court found that Humala and Heredia received several million dollars in illegal contributions for these campaigns from Odebrecht and the government of the then Venezuelan president, Hugo Chávez.

The verdict makes Humala the third former Peruvian president to be imprisoned for corruption in the last two decades. He joins Alejandro Toledo, sentenced in 2024 to 20 years for Odebrecht-related crimes, and Alberto Fujimori, who received multiple convictions for corruption and human rights abuses.

The trial began in 2022, and alongside the 62-year-old former military officer and his 48-year-old wife, the court convicted eight others. Both Humala and Heredia were held in pre-trial detention from 2017 to 2018 at the prosecutor’s request to prevent their flight.

Odebrecht’s 2016 admission of widespread bribery across Latin America preceded the initial investigations against Humala, which started in 2015, a year before the company’s revelations.

Most of the presidents who have governed Peru since 2001 have faced legal problems due to their connections with Odebrecht. Toledo is currently imprisoned, while the former president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski is under house arrest. Alan García, who served two non-consecutive terms, died by suicide in 2019 as authorities moved to arrest him in connection with Odebrecht bribes.

Ice deports Venezuelan teen despite reportedly knowing he was not a target,"A 19-year-old Venezuelan in New York City reportedly was apprehended by Trump administration immigration authorities and deported to El Salvador despite agents’ realizing he was not whom they meant to arrest in a targeted operation.

Merwil Gutiérrez, whose family opened an asylum case after arriving in the US, was deported from the Bronx to the notorious Cecot prison in El Salvador despite his relatives’ insistence that he has no gang ties or criminal history, according to Documented, a newsroom dedicated to telling the stories of immigrants in New York City. The Gutiérrez family says it has been left without information or answers.

The teen was detained alongside 237 other Venezuelans on 24 February by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). His father, Wilmer Gutiérrez, told Documented: “I feel like my son was kidnapped.

“I’ve spent countless hours searching for him, going from one precinct to another, speaking with numerous people who kept referring me elsewhere. Yet, after all this, no one has given me any information or provided a single document about his case.”

The elder Gutiérrez reportedly said he overheard Ice agents saying that his son had not been the person they had come to get.

“The officers grabbed him and two other boys right at the entrance to our building. One said: ‘No, he’s not the one,’ like they were looking for someone else. But the other said: ‘Take him anyway,’” he recalled.

Gutiérrez has no criminal record either in Venezuela or the US, his family said. He also did not have any tattoos, which is a feature that US law enforcement often use to link people to the Tren de Aragua gang – a transnational criminal organization from Venezuela – and to justify their expulsions from the country.

Despite this, Gutiérrez was arrested and later deported to El Salvador, to which he has no ties.

Wilmer Gutiérrez says he discovered through a news report that his son had been deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. He watched videos on social media that showed detainees facing harsh conditions, such as having their heads shaved by authorities and being marched to their prison cells.

“I could have understood if he’d been sent back to Venezuela,” he said. “But why to a foreign country he’s never even been to?”

The Gutiérrez family’s reported ordeal comes after the Trump administration admitted to wrongly deporting a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego García, to the same Cecot facility.

The president of El Salvador said in a meeting with Trump on Monday that the Salvadoran government would not order the return of Abrego García to the US.

Monday’s meeting at the White House came amid a broader push by the Trump administration to remove noncitizens from the US, including people who are here legally and have not been charged with crimes.

Trump has also openly stated that he would like to remove US citizens who commit unspecified violent crimes and send them to the same Salvadoran prison as Abrego García and Gutiérrez.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/15/merwil-gutierrez-venezuelan-teen-deported-el-salvador,1
"Court temporarily blocks Trump bid to cancel legal status of 500,000 migrants","A judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s attempt to terminate a Biden-era program that granted legal status to migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Haiti.

The ruling, in federal district court in Boston, prevents the wholesale shutdown of the program, which was set to expire on 24 April.

It has allowed more than 500,000 people to legally enter and work in the US since its inception.

“[Migrants] would be forced to choose between two injurious options: continue following the law and leave the country on their own, or await removal proceedings,” the judge, Indira Talwani, wrote in her ruling.

The program, established under the previous administration, allowed migrants from those four countries to legally enter and work in the US for up to two years if they had a financial sponsor and passed security checks.

The Biden administration had framed it as a strategic measure to reduce illegal border crossings by creating legitimate pathways to entry.

The Trump administration had moved aggressively in March to end the program, giving participants less than a month’s notice before their legal status expired. It argued the plan exacerbated issues with immigration by granting protections to “a substantial population of aliens in the interior of the United States without a clear path to a durable status”.

The latest legal setback for the Trump team comes amid broader efforts to roll back other immigration protections, including those for thousands of Cameroonian and Afghan migrants – who would face being sent back to the Taliban after siding with the Americans – by either May or June, and a separate attempt to revoke temporary protected status for Venezuelans, which has been blocked for now by a federal court.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/15/court-blocks-trump-legal-status-migrants-cuba-nicaragua-venezuela-haiti,1
Trump officials step up defiance over man wrongly deported to El Salvador,"The Trump administration on Monday misrepresented a US supreme court decision that compelled it to return a man wrongly deported to El Salvador, using tortured readings of the order to justify taking no actions to secure his release.

The supreme court last week unanimously ordered the administration to “facilitate” the release of Kilmar Ábrego García, who was supposed to have been protected from deportation to El Salvador regardless of whether he was a member of the MS-13 gang.

But at an Oval Office meeting between Trump and El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, Trump deferred to officials who gave extraordinary readings of the supreme court order and claimed the US was powerless to return Ábrego García to US soil.

“The ruling solely stated that if this individual at El Salvador’s sole discretion was sent back to our country, we could deport him a second time,” said Trump’s policy chief, Stephen Miller, about an order that, in fact, upheld a lower court’s directive to return Ábrego García.

Miller’s remarks went beyond the tortured reading offered by the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, who also characterized the supreme court order as only requiring the administration to provide transportation to Ábrego García if released by El Salvador.

“That’s up to El Salvador if they want to return him. That’s up to them,” Bondi said. “The supreme court ruled that if El Salvador wants to return him, we would ‘facilitate’ it, meaning provide a plane.”

The remarks at the Oval Office meeting marked an escalation in the Trump administration’s attempts to claim uncertainty with court orders to avoid having to take actions it dislikes. In Ábrego García’s case, officials appeared to manufacture uncertainty in particularly blatant fashion.

And the fact that the US is paying El Salvador to detain deportees it sends to the notorious Cecot prison undercut the notion that the administration lacked the power to return Ábrego García into US custody.

The case started when Ábrego García was detained by police in 2019 in Maryland, outside a Home Depot, with several other men, and asked about a murder. He denied knowledge of a crime and repeatedly denied that he was part of a gang.

Ábrego García was subsequently put in immigration proceedings, where officials argued they believed he was part of the MS-13 gang in New York based on his Chicago Bulls gear and on the word of a confidential informant.

The case went before a US immigration judge, who suggested that Ábrego García could be a member of MS-13 and agreed to a deportation order but shielded him from being sent to El Salvador because he was likely to face persecution there by a local gang.

The Trump administration did not appeal against that decision, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement has since said in a court filing that Ábrego García’s deportation to El Salvador was an “administrative error”. The supreme court also called his removal illegal.

In earlier remarks to reporters on Monday morning, Miller expressly demonstrated he knew the administration had made a mistake because the immigration judge had issued a so-called withholding order, which meant he could not be deported to El Salvador.

“When you have a withholding order, to be clear, that is not ‘pause your deportation’. In other words, in the worst-case scenario, it means you get deported to another country,” Miller said.

That concession evaporated hours later when he joined Trump, Bukele and a dozen senior officials in the Oval Office and suggested that bringing back Ábrego García to the US would be tantamount to kidnapping a citizen of El Salvador.

Miller appeared to be suggesting that the US could not force the actions of El Salvador, a sovereign nation. But he then said the supreme court said neither the president nor the secretary of state could forcibly retrieve a citizen of El Salvador from El Salvador – which the order did not say.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/14/trump-el-salvador-deportation-kilmar-abrego-garcia,1
The Trump administration trapped a wrongly deported man in a catch-22,"It is difficult to find a term more fitting for the fate of the Maryland father Kilmar Ábrego García than Kafkaesque.

Ábrego García is one of hundreds of foreign-born men deported under the Trump administration to the Cecot mega-prison in El Salvador as part of a macabre partnership with the self-declared “world’s coolest dictator”, Nayib Bukele.

The US government has admitted it deported Ábrego García by mistake. But instead of “facilitating” his return as ordered by the supreme court, the administration has trapped Ábrego García in a catch-22 by offshoring his fate to a jurisdiction beyond the reach of legality – or, it would seem, basic logic or common decency.

The paradox is this: the Trump administration says it cannot facilitate the return of Ábrego García because he is in a prison in El Salvador. El Salvador says it cannot return him because that would be tantamount to “smuggling” him into the US.

The absurdity of the position played out on Monday during an Oval Office meeting between Donald Trump and Bukele where the two men appeared to enjoy mocking the powerlessness of the US courts to intervene in the fate of anyone caught in the maws of the Trump administration’s deportation machine.

“How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? I’m not going to do it,” Bukele said when asked about whether he would help to return Ábrego García.

There is no evidence that Ábrego García is a terrorist or a member of the gang MS-13 as the Trump administration has claimed. But that is not really important here.

“I don’t have the power to return him to the United States,” Bukele said during a meeting with the US president on Monday. “They’d love to have a criminal released into our country,” Trump added.

Trump’s lieutenants also jumped in on Monday, arguing that they could not intervene in the case because Ábrego García is a foreign citizen and outside of their control.

“He is a citizen of El Salvador,” said Stephen Miller, a top Trump aide who regularly advises the president on immigration issues. “It’s very arrogant even for American media to suggest that we would even tell El Salvador how to handle their own citizens.”

A district court injunction to halt the deportation was in effect, he added, an order to “kidnap a citizen of El Salvador and fly him back here”.

Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, repeated one of the Trump administration’s mantras: that US courts cannot determine Trump’s foreign policy. Increasingly, the administration is including questions of immigration in that foreign policy in order to defy the courts.

Monday’s presentation was in effect a pantomime. Both sides could quickly intervene if they wanted to. But this was a means to an end. Miller said this case would not end with Ábrego García living in the US.

More broadly, it indicates the Trump administration’s modus operandi: to move quickly before the courts can react to its transgressions and, when they do, to deflect and defy until the damage done cannot be reversed.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/14/abrego-garcia-trump-administration-el-salvador-nayib-bukele,1
El Salvador president refuses to return wrongly deported man with US protected status,"The president of El Salvador said in a meeting with Donald Trump in the White House on Monday that he would not order the return of a Maryland man who was deported in error to a Salvadorian mega-prison.

“The question is preposterous,” Nayib Bukele said in the Oval Office on Monday, where he was welcomed by Trump and spoke with the president and members of his cabinet. “How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? I’m not going to do it.”

He added: “I don’t have the power to return him to the United States,” and said he would not release the man, Kilmar Ábrego García, into El Salvador either. “I’m not very fond of releasing terrorists into the country.”

The comments came a day after the Trump administration claimed it was not legally obligated to secure the return of Ábrego García, despite the US supreme court ruling that the administration should “facilitate” bringing him back.

Lawyers for the justice department argued in court filings on Sunday that asking El Salvador to return Ábrego García from a notorious mega-prison should be considered “foreign relations”, and was therefore outside the scope of the courts.

The filing said “the federal courts have no authority to direct the Executive Branch to conduct foreign relations in a particular way, or engage with a foreign sovereign in a given manner,” adding: “That is the exclusive power of the president as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations.”

Earlier this month, the Trump administration acknowledged that Ábrego García, an immigrant from El Salvador who was living in Maryland with protected status, was deported to a prison in El Salvador on 15 March as a result of an “administrative error”. In 2019 an immigration judge had prohibited the federal government from deporting him.

When he was deported anyway, swept up in Trump’s effort to send hundreds of supposed gang members to El Salvador without due process, Ábrego García’s wife and relatives filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration.

On 4 April a district judge, Paula Xinis, directed the administration to “facilitate and effectuate” his return. The supreme court upheld the directive on Thursday, and also instructed Xinis to clarify the order “with due regard for the deference owed to the executive branch in the conduct of foreign affairs”.

On Friday, Xinis said in a hearing that it was “extremely troubling” that the administration had failed to comply with a court order to provide details about Ábrego García’s whereabouts and status. She ordered that it provide daily updates on efforts to facilitate his return.

On Saturday, the Trump administration confirmed Ábrego García was alive and confined in El Salvador’s mega-prison, Cecot.

Then, on Sunday, the justice department said it interpreted the court’s order to “facilitate” Ábrego García’s return as only requiring them to “remove any domestic obstacles that would otherwise impede the alien’s ability to return here”.

It added: “No other reading of ‘facilitate’ is tenable – or constitutional – here.”

In a separate court filing on Sunday, an official from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) said that the 2019 order preventing Ábrego García’s removal to El Salvador was no longer valid, as a result of the administration’s allegation that he was a member of the MS-13 gang, “which is now a designated foreign terrorist organization”, the court filing states.

On Monday, during the Oval Office meeting between Trump and Bukele, Stephen Miller, White House homeland security adviser, repeated the claim that the 2019 order was no longer valid when Ábrego García was deported, and said that bringing him back to the US would be “to kidnap a citizen of El Salvador and fly him back here”.

The attorney general, Pam Bondi, echoed that it was up to El Salvador “whether they want to return him”, not the US. Bondi also claimed the supreme court ruling meant that “if El Salvador wants to return him, we would ‘facilitate’ it, meaning provide a plane”.

But Miller also said: “No version of this ends with him living here.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/14/trump-doj-return-man-wrongly-deported-el-salvador,1
UK trade secretary to visit China with aim of reviving key joint trade commission,"The trade secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, will travel to Beijing to revive a key trade dialogue with China despite saying it had been naive to allow Chinese investment in sensitive sectors, the Guardian has learned.

Reynolds is scheduled to travel to China later this year for high-level talks in an effort to boost bilateral trade and investment.

His trip is intended to restart the UK-China joint economic and trade commission (Jetco), which has not met since 2018 when relations began deteriorating after Beijing’s crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong.

In documents published after Rachel Reeves’s trip to China in January, the Treasury set out its intention to revive the talks.

The government is also planning to conclude its cross-Whitehall audit of UK-China relations by June, although the results will not be published in full.

The audit fulfils a Labour manifesto commitment and is expected to make a number of policy recommendations, including a call to improve expertise on China within government. This could include Mandarin language programmes, and training for civil servants and parliamentarians about the Chinese system. The Foreign Office declined to comment.

Reynolds’s trip will raise eyebrows after he said on Sunday that the UK had “got it wrong in the past” and Conservative governments had been “far too naive” about allowing Chinese investment in sensitive industries such as steel.

The government has also come under pressure to take a tougher stance towards Beijing over human rights and security concerns. In an article for the Guardian on Tuesday Wera Hobhouse, a Liberal Democrat MP who was refused entry to Hong Kong to visit her grandchild last week, said that “until we get a clear answer for why I was deported, no government minister should be visiting China on official business”.

Hobhouse said she believed she was denied entry “because of my role as a British parliamentarian, and one who has levelled criticism at Beijing for its human rights abuses”.

Ministers seized control of British Steel’s Scunthorpe steelmaking plant from its Chinese owners, Jingye, on Saturday amid a rapid deterioration in relations with the company’s executives. Some inside the government suspect Jingye’s actions may have been intended to stop Britain producing its own virgin steel and force it to rely on imports from China.

“You’ve got to be clear about what is the sort of sector where actually we can promote and cooperate and ones, frankly, where we can’t,” Reynolds told Sky News’s Trevor Phillips on Sunday. “I wouldn’t personally bring a Chinese company into our steel sector.”

He argued that even privately owned firms had direct links to the Chinese Communist party,

said “a lot of UK-Chinese trade is in non-contentious areas” such as agriculture, life sciences and the automotive sector.

He appeared to moderate his comments about the steel industry on Tuesday, telling broadcasters that he would look at Chinese firms “in a different way” without ruling out their involvement completely.

Reynolds’s planned trip is a signal that the government does not intend to row back on its rapprochement with Beijing. Keir Starmer is also expected to visit China later this year.

Asked in October whether the UK would revive the Jetco, Reynolds said he was “certainly open to having a conversation” about it. Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak both drew up plans to do so while they were in office.

China reportedly orders its airlines to halt Boeing jet deliveries amid US trade war,"China has reportedly ordered its airlines not to take any further deliveries of Boeing jets, the latest move in its tit-for-tat trade war with the US.

The Chinese government has asked carriers to stop purchases of aircraft-related equipment and parts from American companies, according to a Bloomberg News article, which cited people familiar with the matter.

The order was reported to have come after the country raised its retaliatory tariffs on US goods to 125% on Friday in response to Donald Trump’s levies on Chinese imports totalling 145%. Beijing was also said to be considering ways to support airlines that lease Boeing jets and are facing higher costs.

About 10 Boeing 737 Max jets are being prepared to join Chinese airlines, and if delivery paperwork and payment on some of them were completed before Chinese ”reciprocal” tariffs came into effect, the planes may be allowed to enter the country, sources told Bloomberg.

The restriction marks a serious blow for Boeing and other manufacturers trying to navigate the escalating trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.

The group chief executive of the budget airline Ryanair, Michael O’Leary, has said his company could delay taking deliveries of Boeing aircraft if they become more expensive. He told the Financial Times that Ryanair was due to receive a further 25 aircraft from Boeing from August but would not need the planes until around March or April 2026. “We might delay them and hope that common sense will prevail,” O’Leary said.

Shares in Boeing have been buffeted by worries about the impact of trade tariffs, as well as complaints from some shareholders that the company has underinvested in its engineering.

The company has lost 7% of its market value since the start of the year, and in March its chief financial officer, Brian West, said tariffs could hit availability of parts from its suppliers.

The rival European plane manufacturer Airbus said on Tuesday that it was watching the evolving situation on trade tariffs. Its chief executive, Guillaume Faury, told shareholders the company was having problems receiving components from the American supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which was weighing on the production of its A350 and A220 jetliners.

The chaotic introduction of Donald Trump’s tariffs has triggered volatility in the stock market since 2 April, although there has been a tentative recovery this week after the US president announced he was temporarily suspending planned tariffs on imports of smartphones and laptops.

The S&P 500, the American blue-chip index of stocks, ticked up 0.7% in early trading on Tuesday, but was still down about 7% so far this year.

There remains a great deal of uncertainty around possible tariffs on computer chips and pharmaceutical imports, with the Trump administration initiating an investigation into the impact of trade in these areas on American national security. Meanwhile, the chip designer Nvidia has announced it will build up to $500bn (£378bn) worth of artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US over the next four years.

In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei index rose by 0.8% on Tuesday and South Korea’s Kospi by 0.9%, with strong gains for carmakers such as Honda, Suzuki and Hyundai, after Trump signalled there would be help for the industry.

On Monday the president told reporters in Washington he was “looking at something to help some of the car companies”, and added that carmakers “need a little bit of time” before they can start to build parts in the US rather than in countries such as Canada and Mexico.

The US administration previously announced a 25% tariff on all imports of foreign cars, excluding some exemptions for Mexico and Canada. Analysts at the advisory firm Telemetry predicted the move could result in 1.8m fewer car sales in the US and Canada this year.

Shares also rose in Europe, with London’s benchmark FTSE 100 index and the more domestic-focused FTSE 250 rising by 0.8% and 1% respectively after optimistic comments from the US vice-president, JD Vance, about a possible trade deal with the UK. In an interview on Tuesday with the website Unherd, Vance said he believed both sides could come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

“We’re certainly working very hard with Keir Starmer’s government” on a trade deal, he said.

“There’s a real cultural affinity. And, of course, fundamentally, America is an Anglo country. I think there’s a good chance that, yes, we’ll come to a great agreement that’s in the best interest of both countries.”

"China’s Xi aims to ‘screw’ US on south-east Asia tour, says Trump","Xi Jinping’s tour of south-east Asia this week is probably intended to “screw” the United States, Donald Trump has suggested, as Xi embarks on a five-day tour of some of the nations hardest hit by Trump’s tariffs.

China’s president visited Hanoi on Monday, where he met the leader of Vietman’s Communist party, Tô Lâm, called for stronger trade ties and signed dozens of cooperation agreements, including on enhancing supply chains, before heading to Malaysia.

Reacting to the Vietnam meeting, Trump said the discussions were focused on how to harm the US, but he didn’t hold it against the two countries.

“I don’t blame China; I don’t blame Vietnam,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “That’s a lovely meeting. Meeting like, trying to figure out: ‘How do we screw the United States of America?’”

Vietnam, a major industrial and assembly hub, is among countries in south-east Asia that are reeling from some of the most punitive of Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs, hit with a rate of 46%. The US is Vietnam’s main export market, for which it is a crucial source of everything from footwear and apparel to electronics.

In the first three months of this year, its exports to Washington amounted to $31.4bn, while Hanoi imported goods worth about $30bn from Beijing.

Xi’s visit to Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia this week comes as Beijing faces tariffs of 145%, and as other countries seek to negotiate reductions in their tariffs during a 90-day reprieve.

Xi’s trip to Hanoi offered an opportunity to consolidate relations with a neighbour that has received billions of dollars of Chinese investments in recent years, as China-based manufacturers moved south to avoid tariffs imposed by the first Trump administration.

In Malaysia on Tuesday, the Chinese leader said he was looking forward to “further deepening the traditional friendship” between the two countries.

“China will work with Malaysia … to combat the undercurrents of geopolitical and camp-based confrontation, as well as the countercurrents of unilateralism and protectionism,” Xi wrote in an article for Malaysia’s The Star newspaper.

Xi had planned to travel to the region before Trump’s tariff announcement, but the visit was fortuitously timed, with the Chinese leader positing China as a stable trading partner, in contrast to the chaotic policy backflips coming out of Washington.

In an article in Nhân Dân, the newspaper of Vietnam’s Communist party, Xi wrote that there were “no winners in trade wars and tariff wars” and that protectionism “leads nowhere”.

In a meeting with Vietnam’s prime minister, Pham Minh Chính, Xi said the two countries should oppose unilateral bullying.

Vietnam and many other south-east Asian countries are trying to maintain a delicate balancing act between the US and China amid fears the region could be used as a potential dumping zone for Chinese exports barred from the US.

Phan Xuan Dung, a research officer in the Vietnam studies programme at ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said: “If past patterns hold, it would be reasonable to expect that Vietnam might seek to balance this significant Chinese engagement with comparable diplomatic outreach to the United States or other partners in the coming months.”

Escalating tensions between the US and China have fuelled concerns about a decoupling of the world’s two largest economies, a fear the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, sought to dispel on Monday.

“There’s a big deal to be done at some point,” Bessent said when asked by Bloomberg TV. There did not “have to be” decoupling, he said, “but there could be.”

One of China’s lead officials overseeing Hong Kong hit out at the US on Tuesday over its trade war. Xia Baolong said in a televised speech that the dispute was “extremely shameless” and aimed to “take away Hong Kong’s life”. Hong Kong is subject to the same tariffs imposed on mainland China but has not proposed any of its own in retaliation.

Xia said China was not “afraid of trouble”. “Let those peasants in the United States wail in front of the 5,000 years of Chinese civilisation,” he said, possibly in reference to JD Vance’s recent criticism.

China-US tensions appear to have shifted some trade war battles to other fronts. Xi has sought further US-excluded cooperation with the EU, and in Latin America the US is pushing governments to reduce their financial ties with China.

Bessent said he had met the Argentinian president, Javier Milei, on Monday, telling Bloomberg the Trump administration was focused on helping Latin American countries avert what he called “rapacious” agreements made with China to give up mining rights in return for aid.

Beijing’s embassy in Argentina accused Bessent of “maliciously slandering and smearing” China and told the US to refrain from “obstructing and deliberately sabotaging” developing countries.

The White House had appeared to dial down the pressure recently, listing tariff exemptions for smartphones, laptops, semiconductors and other electronic products for which China is a major source.

But Trump and some of his top aides said on Sunday the exemptions had been misconstrued and would only be temporary. “Nobody is getting ‘off the hook’ … especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.

Revealed: Chinese researchers can access half a million UK GP records,"Researchers from China are to be allowed access to half a million UK GP records despite western intelligence agencies’ fears about the authoritarian regime amassing health data, the Guardian can reveal.

Preparations are under way to transfer the records to UK Biobank, a research hub that holds detailed medical information donated by 500,000 volunteers. One of the world’s largest troves of health data, the facility makes its information available to universities, scientific institutes and private companies. A Guardian analysis shows one in five successful applications for access come from China.

For the past year, health officials had been assessing whether extra safeguards were needed for patient records when added to the genomes, tissue samples and questionnaire responses held by UK Biobank. Personal details such as names and dates of birth are stripped from UK Biobank data before it is shared but experts say that in some cases individuals can still be identified.

MI5, the UK Security Service, has warned that Chinese organisations and individuals granted access to UK data can be ordered by Chinese intelligence agencies “to carry out work on their behalf”. But UK Biobank told the Guardian that the NHS unit responsible for health data had in recent weeks cleared it to grant Chinese researchers access to GP records.

As Keir Starmer’s ministers court Beijing in search of economic growth, the decision avoids crossing a rising superpower that has made biotech prowess a priority. UK-China relations already face tests over the fate of a Chinese-owned steel plant in Scunthorpe and plans for new rules on foreign interference campaigns.

“Security and privacy considerations are always taken into account when UK health data is used to drive forward our understanding of diseases and advance scientific research,” a government spokesperson said. Health data was “only shared with legitimate researchers”, they added.

Chi Onwurah, a Labour MP who chairs parliament’s science and technology committee, said: “UK Biobank is an enormous success and global medical research is all the better for it.” But she added: “We need a government-wide strategy that gives people confidence that they have control of their data, that their data is only ever shared securely and responsibly, and that reflects the realities of geopolitics and the potential for bad actors to use our data for ill.”

Approving access to patient records

Of the 1,375 successful applications for access to UK Biobank data, 265 came from China, or almost 20%, second only to the US, according to a Guardian analysis of its published records. Chinese scientists have used UK Biobank data to understand the effects of air pollution and to spot biological markers that could predict dementia.

Last year, UK Biobank approved access for a research project on ageing by a unit of the Chinese genetics company BGI. The US, by contrast, has blacklisted BGI subsidiaries, barring Americans from exporting to them.

Joe Biden’s government justified the restrictions in 2023, saying it had information indicating that BGI units’ “collection and analysis of genetic data poses a significant risk of contributing to monitoring and surveillance by the government of China, which has been utilised in the repression of ethnic minorities in China”. It also claimed “the actions of these entities concerning the collection and analysis of genetic data present a significant risk of diversion to China’s military programs”.

These were “unsubstantiated allegations”, a BGI representative said. “We have never undertaken genetic surveillance of anybody. BGI does not engage in unethical practices and does not provide gene technology for surveillance. BGI does not condone and would never be involved in any human rights abuses.” The company dismissed claims the military could access data, saying its research “is undertaken for civilian and scientific purposes only”.

A UK Biobank representative said it was “continually in dialogue” with MI5 and other state agencies about the use of its data, including by BGI.

Despite objections from some GPs, in October Wes Streeting, the health secretary, gave instructions to press ahead with the transfer of patient records for consenting volunteers to UK Biobank and other research hubs.

“Access will only be for countries approved by NHS England,” Michael Chapman, a senior NHS official, told UK Biobank’s conference in December, adding that approval would be based on “security considerations” and countries’ data protection.

NHS England, the body that manages the health service and oversees the use of health data, has in recent weeks audited UK Biobank’s processes for sharing data internationally, including how it assesses applications from China, a representative of the research hub said. UK Biobank passed the audit, the representative said, so Chinese researchers would be able to apply for access to the GP records.

NHS England said: “Any approval of access to personal data from overseas territories requires data recipients to comply with their responsibilities” under UK data law “and is kept under review if circumstances change”.

China is ‘developing the world’s largest bio database’

Data troves such as UK Biobank “were set up to encourage research worldwide”, says a leaked May 2024 NHS England presentation on policing access to GP records, “but the global picture has since changed”.

Yves Moreau, a geneticist who has worked on projects using data from UK Biobank and praises it as a “world class” resource, said China’s rulers “regard genomic data and other health data as strategic”. He said it was “reasonable to worry about China vacuuming such data from around the world to strengthen its biotech sector”.

Beyond commercial advantages, intelligence sources say health data can be useful in espionage if anonymisation can be broken. Experts say it may be possible to match public information about an individual’s medical treatment with anonymised patient records to identify who they refer to. UK Biobank’s representative said it had “no evidence of anyone being identified”.

After China adopted new legislation in 2017 to enforce cooperation with the regime’s spies, MI5 warned custodians of British personal data that the national intelligence law “may affect the level of control you have over your information and assets as you engage with Chinese individuals and organisations, especially if you work in an area that is of interest to the Chinese state”.

China is “developing the world’s largest bio database”, Edward You, then a top US intelligence officer specialising in new technologies, said in 2021. “Once they have access to your genetic data, it’s not something you can change like a pin code.”

Privacy campaigners at medConfidential asked UK Biobank last year “whether Biobank continues to send British citizens’ genetic and (NHS) patient data to China or other ‘hostile states’.” They added: “No one should be satisfied that there is still no clarity on exactly what patient data Biobank has disseminated to what researchers where, despite this being a constant question for multiple years.”

Until last year, UK Biobank allowed researchers to take copies of its data. Recipients agreed to destroy it once their projects were finished but there was no way to ensure they did. In October, the Guardian revealed that a fringe group promoting racist pseudoscience claimed to have access to UK Biobank data. UK Biobank has now switched to a system where researchers access data within its own platform. Its representative said access to GP records would be through this platform only.

Prof Sir Rory Collins, UK Biobank’s chief executive, said: “All our volunteers have given explicit consent for researchers to study their de-identified health data, and many have emphasised the importance of their GP data being analysed.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/15/revealed-chinese-researchers-access-half-a-million-uk-gp-records,1
Nvidia says it will build up to $500bn of US AI infrastructure as chip tariff looms,"The chip designer Nvidia has said it will build up to $500bn (£378bn) worth of artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US over the next four years, in a sign of manufacturers investing in operations on American soil amid Donald Trump’s tariffs.

The announcement comes after Trump reiterated threats on Sunday to impose imminent tariffs on the semiconductors that Nvidia makes mostly in Taiwan, and after the chipmaker’s chief executive, Jensen Huang, dined at the president’s Mar-a-Lago resort earlier this month.

Nvidia, whose chips have helped drive the huge wave of artificial intelligence (AI) development in recent years, will work with its manufacturing partners to design and build factories so it can create “supercomputers” completely within the US.

Nvidia designs its chips but outsources its production to contractors such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). In its last financial year, Nvidia reported that its cost of revenue, which consists primarily of support for manufacturing, testing and producing chips, stood at $16.6bn.

Production of its popular Blackwell graphics processing unit has already started at TSMC’s plant in Phoenix, Arizona, Nvidia said. Construction of new plants is also under way with the manufacturers Foxconn in Houston and Wistron in Dallas. Mass production at both plants is expected to ramp up in the next 12 to 15 months.

Huang said that adding American manufacturing helped the company “better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers”, strengthened its supply chain and boosted its resiliency. The White House said in a statement that Nvidia’s decision was “the Trump Effect in action”.

Nvidia’s stock market valuation has ballooned in recent years thanks to huge demand for its AI chips, with the shares rising by more than 1,000% since 2020. However, tariff uncertainty has wiped hundreds of billions of dollars off its market value since the start of this year, with the share price sinking by about 20%.

Global stock markets have opened this week tentatively higher on hopes that Trump could ease some of his new levies. On Tuesday, Japan’s Nikkei rose by 0.8% and South Korea’s Kospi by 0.9%. However, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped by 0.16% and Chinese markets were also lower, down 0.1% in Shanghai. In Europe, markets also gradually continued their recovery, with the UK’s FTSE 100 index up 40 points, or 0.5%, to 8,175 in early trading, while Germany’s Dax gained 0.7% and France’s Cac was up 0.1%.

Trump is still pressing ahead with plans to impose tariffs on semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports. On Tuesday, the US Department of Commerce initiated an investigation into the impact of imports of chips and pharmaceuticals on American national security.

So far, pharmaceuticals and chips have been exempt from the 10% tariffs that started on 5 April. However, Trump said on Sunday that he would announce a tariff rate on imported semiconductors over the next week, adding that there would be some flexibility for certain companies in the sector.

The US relies heavily on chips imported from Taiwan, although Trump placed a 32% tariff on products from the country, which has been suspended for 90 days along with nearly all his “reciprocal” tariffs. Joe Biden also tried to bolster the American semiconductor industry during his presidency by granting billions-worth of subsidies via his Chips Act in 2022 that awarded chipmakers who expanded manufacturing and production in the US.

Several global drug companies have also announced investments in the US this year as the sector tackles the threat of tariffs on pharmaceuticals. Last week, the Swiss drugmaker Novartis outlined plans to spend $23bn to build and expand 10 facilities in the US.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/15/nvidia-to-build-500bn-of-us-ai-infrastructure-as-chip-tariff-looms,1
"Indonesia dismisses report Russia seeking to base aircraft in country as ‘simply not true’, Australia says","Indonesia’s defence minister has said reports Russia is seeking to base military aircraft in the country “are simply not true”, according to the Australian government, after Canberra made urgent calls to Jakarta.

The report from defence and security news website Janes said Moscow had filed an official request with Jakarta for permission for Russian aerospace forces (VKS) aircraft, including several long-range aircraft, to be based at a facility in Biak.

But Richard Marles, Australia’s defence minister and deputy prime minister, said in a statement on Tuesday night that he had spoken to his Indonesian counterpart, Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin, about the reports.

“[He] said to me in the clearest possible terms, reports of the prospect of Russian aircraft operating from Indonesia are simply not true,” Marles said.

Marles had earlier downplayed the report that Moscow had filed an official request with Jakarta for permission for Russian aerospace forces (VKS) aircraft, including several long-range aircraft, to be based at a facility in Biak.

The airbase in Biak is home to the Indonesian air force’s aviation squadron 27, which operates a fleet of CN235 surveillance aircraft. Biak, in Indonesia’s easternmost Papua region, is about 1,400km from Darwin.

The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said on Tuesday: “We obviously do not want to see Russian influence in our region, very clearly.

“We have a position, which is: we stand with Ukraine, we regard [the Russian president] Vladimir Putin as an authoritarian leader who has broken international law, that is attacking the sovereignty of the nation of Ukraine.”

Janes’ report said the Indonesian defence minister received the request following his meeting in February with Sergei Shoigu, the secretary of Russia’s security council and a longtime Putin ally.

Australia is in the middle of an election campaign, with the news emerging while Albanese and his main opponent, the Liberal party leader, Peter Dutton, took part in campaign activities. Dutton told a press conference that Putin was “not welcome in our neighbourhood”.

“We do not want a presence, a military presence, from Russia in our region, which would be destabilising for south-east Asia, and it would certainly be a very different calculation for the risks that are posed to our country in a period that is very uncertain,” Dutton said.

He said the Australian Labor government should reveal whether it received forewarning of the Russian request from Indonesia, a detail Albanese did not offer in his press conference.

Albanese repeated several times that his government was seeking further information or “proper clarification”, but would not provide any substantial comment.

“That’s the way you deal with international relations. Making sure that you’re not flying from the hip,” he said.

At a separate press conference, the Australian foreign minister, Penny Wong, said she was “aware of the reports” and that the government was in the process of finding out more information.

“We, as a government, have reached out to confirm those reports and to understand whether or not those reports are accurate and what the status of those requests from Russia are,” she said.

Senior Indonesian military officials and the Russian embassy in Jakarta did not immediately respond to comment on the reported proposal, but analysts said it was unlikely the unusual request would be granted given how geopolitically risky it would be.

“Even if Russia is proposing to use an Indonesian airbase, I doubt that the government will allow it. There will be a very significant blowback,” Yohanes Sulaiman, a defence analyst and lecturer at the Jenderal Achmad Yani university, said. “The Indonesian military is very averse to having other countries build military bases in Indonesia.”

Member of Commission I of the Indonesian House of Representatives, Major General TNI (ret.) TB Hasanuddin, emphasised that the establishment of foreign military bases in Indonesian territory would be a violation of the constitution.



“Our constitution and various laws and regulations expressly prohibit the existence of foreign military bases,” he said in a statement.

“The establishment of foreign military bases will only drag Indonesia into geopolitical games that are counterproductive to world peace.”

Indonesia has long practised what it called an “independent and active” foreign policy, which emphasises its commitment to non-alignment.

In recent years it has held military exercises with the US, Australia and China. In November 2024, Indonesia and Russia held their first bilateral naval exercise off Java, a move that was deemed controversial amid widespread criticism of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Indonesia and Russia pledged to strengthen their defence ties at the Sjamsoeddin-Shoigu meeting in February. The meeting came after Indonesia, south-east Asia’s largest economy, was admitted as a full member to the Brics bloc of developing economies, of which Russia is one of the founding members.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/15/australia-pm-voices-concern-after-report-russia-requested-access-to-indonesia-air-force-base,1
Coalition MP Colin Boyce told climate science deniers blackouts a ‘big political opportunity’,"Coalition MP Colin Boyce told a group of climate science deniers that blackouts were “a big political opportunity” and that he had urged fellow MPs to adopt a “do nothing strategy” that would allow power outages and build opposition to net-zero policies.

A video of Boyce, posted on YouTube, speaking to the Climate and Energy Realists Queensland group, includes comments by the Flynn MP that net-zero climate policies “need a rethink”.

He said the cohort of like-minded politicians opposed to the transition to renewables “is growing”.

“Politically, how do you sell that? That’s the problem,” Boyce told the meeting in December 2023.

“I’ve said this many times to the colleagues, we have to probably adopt a ‘do nothing’ strategy, obviously fight the good fight.

“The ‘do nothing’ strategy is a tough love strategy where people will not understand what’s happening until the lights go out.

“When the lifts in the building stop working and the supermarket shelves are empty because the refrigerators aren’t working, that’s when all of a sudden people start to realise.”

Later, Boyce was asked a question about potential power outages and he responded by saying: “It’s a big political opportunity for that to happen.”

Boyce predicted power outages would be “along similar lines” to the 1985 South East Queensland Electricity Generating Board strikes during the Joh Bjelke-Petersen government, which caused rolling power outages for four weeks.

“It’s enormously frustrating and there’s no simple fixes to any of these problems,” Boyce said.

“To turn the renewable energy ship around, where it sits at the moment will take a change of government.”

The Nationals MP was a founding member of the “Saltbush Club”, formed to promote climate science denial, and was a signatory to an international statement claiming “there is no climate emergency”.

Boyce has also been an advocate of the Coalition’s plans to build nuclear power generation.

He told the group: “If I had my way I’d be building coal-fired power stations, full stop, that’s what I’d be doing.

“We have these enormous reserves of coal and we should be using it.

“Obviously as we go on to the future we should be exploring nuclear technology.

“In the meantime we need to maintain our traditional coal-fired power fleet.”

Guardian Australia contacted the Coalition and Boyce for comment but did not receive a response before publication.",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/16/coalition-mp-colin-boyce-told-climate-science-deniers-blackouts-a-big-political-opportunity,1
"Peter Dutton’s nuclear power plan could lead to major electricity shortages, analysis says","Peter Dutton’s plan to build less renewable energy and keep Australia’s coal plants running longer has overestimated the reliability of ageing generators and could lead to major electricity shortages, according to a new analysis.

The Coalition has pledged to put taxpayer-funded nuclear reactors at seven sites around Australia and has pointed to modelling by Frontier Economics that shows the country’s ageing coal fleet would need to take up the slack in electricity generation while they are built.

But the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) said the modelling had assumed the ageing coal plants would be able to generate between 72% and 81% of their capacity, much higher than previous plants that were near the end of their life.

The IEEFA report looked at the 13 coal plants to have closed since 2000 and found in the 10 years before they were turned off, they were only available on average 66% of the time due to unplanned outages and the need for increased maintenance.

When IEEFA adjusted the Coalition’s numbers between 2034 and 2043 to account for what it said was a more realistic estimate of the coal fleet’s capabilities, it found a shortfall of 9,300 gigawatt-hours a year – the equivalent of the power consumed by 2 million households.

Johanna Bowyer, lead analyst on Australian electricity at IEEFA, said failing to account for the poor performance of an ageing coal fleet would risk unexpected coal outages “and a system that hasn’t been built to account for them”.

Tristan Edis, a co-author of the report and analyst at Green Energy Markets, said the average age of a coal plant when it retired was 42 years.

“Over the 2030s, the existing coal-fired power stations will be close to, or have exceeded, the age at which past coal plants typically retired.

“We should be planning for the likelihood that they will suffer a similar deterioration in their availability.”

A report commissioned by the Climate Council last year looked at data from 2014 to 2024 and found coal plants less than 40 years old were available for 81% of the time, dropping to 65% in their later years.

Edis said if a future government was forced to rely on more gas generation to fill the gaps, this would burn between 49 and 93 petajoules of gas annually from 2034 to 2043.



Edis said: “This is a large amount of additional gas considering the average amount of gas used for electricity generation over the past five years was 122PJ per year.

“This additional gas requirement would have serious consequences for the price and availability of gas for other consumers.”

Danger of nuclear delays

The modelling backed by the Coalition assumed the first nuclear reactor would be producing power by 2036, with further plants coming online from 2039 onwards.

Many energy experts, including the CSIRO, have been less optimistic, saying it could take until the early 2040s before a plant could be operating, and possibly longer.

The IEEFA report said four nuclear plants recently brought online in Europe and the United States had seen delays of between six and 14 years – an average delay of 11 years.

Bowyer said: “If we have an 11-year delay with the nuclear build, we would see a huge energy supply gap. Filling that gap with new generation becomes really tricky and extending those coal plants even further just exacerbates the risk [of them becoming less reliable].”

Guardian Australia approached Frontier Economics for comment.

A statement from the Coalition said Labor’s renewables-based approach was “forcing the premature closure of coal generation – well before their notified closure dates”.

“Proper maintenance can ensure coal plants are not closed prematurely. The Coalition’s approach, based on comprehensive and evidence-backed modelling, ensures that coal continues to play a crucial role in Australia’s energy mix, both now and in the future.”

The Frontier modelling was a “realistic and comprehensive view”, the statement said, of the maintenance costs for coal plants “while recognising the ongoing importance of coal in maintaining grid stability during the energy transition”.

“Labor talks about phasing out coal, but behind closed doors they are cutting deals with the states to keeping them online.”",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/16/peter-duttons-nuclear-power-plan-could-lead-to-major-electricity-shortages-analysis-says,1
Muslim advocacy group to preference Greens above Labor in some seats despite disagreement on religious freedom,"A potentially influential Muslim advocacy group is planning to tell voters to preference the Greens above Labor on how-to-vote cards in several key seats, despite objecting to the minor party’s position on religious freedom in schools.

Muslim Votes Matter has expressed concern about the party’s plan to ensure religious schools cannot discriminate against teachers or students on the basis of their sexuality, but has welcomed a commitment to ensure “all rights are acknowledged and taken into account”.

The group, which is campaigning for candidates in 32 seats has endorsed Greens in the Victorian seats of Wills and Bruce, where Labor MPs are preparing for a backlash over the party’s response to the war in Gaza. Most of the 32 seats are held by Labor and have significant Muslim populations.

Muslim Votes Matter has also endorsed the Greens in the Queensland seat of Moreton, the South Australian seat of Sturt, and independents in the western-Sydney seats of Blaxland and Watson, held by Labor ministers Jason Clare and Tony Burke.

Guardian Australia has also confirmed the political party launched by the former Labor senator Fatima Payman, who has a strong personal brand in suburbs with high Muslim populations, Australia’s Voice, will also encourage voters to preference the Greens above her former party and the Liberals on Senate ballot papers.

Ghaith Krayem, the national spokesperson for Muslim Votes Matter, said the group’s how-to-vote cards were being finalised after discussion with endorsed candidates. He said they would be similar to, but perhaps not exactly the same as those handed out by endorsed candidates.

“We as a rule, will put parties like One Nation or The Trumpet of Patriots at the bottom of our how to vote card,” Krayem said. “If a candidate moves them up, we will not do that.”

In a letter to Muslim Votes Matter last month, the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, sought to address the group’s concerns about religious freedom, accepting a request to attend further consultation meetings to ensure “that all rights are acknowledged and taken into account”.

“Schools could continue to require that a teacher hired by the school teaches the school’s values and doctrines. A staff member could not be discriminated against on the basis of their sexuality or gender identity, just as it would be unlawful under Australian law to discriminate against someone based on protected attributes in other workplaces.”

Muslim Votes Matter said it did not agree with the Greens’ position, but was satisfied with their engagement.

“We know that on that particular issue, we were never going to be 100% aligned,” Krayem said. “We put forward a pathway of consultation, not just with us, but with other interested minority groups on this issue.

Labor declined to engage with Muslim Votes Matter and accused the group of being a “self-appointed organisation that seeks to support Peter Dutton” in a manner that was “contrary to the interests of Australian Muslim communities”.

Krayem denied this and said the criticism was “very inappropriate from a major party in the middle of a campaign” and “full of disdain for our community”. The group has previously suggested Labor wants “a quiet, loyal Muslim voter”.

Before the 2022 election, Labor committed to introducing laws that would protect all students from discrimination on any grounds, and to protect teachers from discrimination while maintaining the right of schools to preference people of their faith while hiring.

In August, Anthony Albanese said his government was unwilling to act on these issues in the absence of bipartisan support, citing concerns about “the need for greater social cohesion”.

“And the last thing that Australia needs is any divisive debate relating to religion and people’s faith … I don’t intend to engage in a partisan debate when it comes to religious discrimination,” Albanese said.

Equality Australia’s chief executive, Anna Brown, accused Labor of breaking an election commitment by “failing to pursue the available pathway through parliament for a government bill that would have finally protected LGBTQ+ students and staff in religious schools”.

“More children will now be refused enrolment or miss out on school leadership roles and more teachers will continue to lose their jobs or be denied promotions because of the gaps in our laws that allow religious schools to play by their own rules,” Brown said.

A Labor spokesperson said if re-elected, the party would continue to consult on religious freedom but only introduce legislation once bipartisan support was clear.",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/16/muslim-advocacy-group-to-preference-greens-above-labor-in-some-seats-despite-disagreement-on-religious-freedom,1
Brisbane Greens MP joins OnlyFans to ‘make people pay attention’ to HIV prevention drug policy,"The Greens MP Stephen Bates has joined OnlyFans – a first for an Australian politician – as the party pushes to make the HIV prevention drugs PrEP and PEP free.

It may normally be a career-ending move for a politician to be joining a site known for pornography, but Bates has joined the site with the first video on his free-to-subscribe page announcing the Greens’ push to make PrEP and PEP prescriptions free to anyone with a script.

Bates does not intend to post not-safe-for-work content on the platform.

OnlyFans does not exclusively host adult content, but adult creators have flocked to the site that allows people to subscribe and access free or paid content. OnlyFans takes a 20% cut on each transaction.

At the end of 2023, OnlyFans reported 4.1m creator accounts and 305m fan accounts registered, with gross payments in 2023 of US$6.6bn. Social Rise claimed in January 2024 there were 28m visits to OnlyFans from Australia.

Along with the OnlyFans launch, the gay MP for Brisbane has repeated his 2022 election campaign tactic of advertising on the gay and bisexual hookup app Grindr.

“Ending HIV is too important to fly under the radar,” he said. “I campaign on OnlyFans and Grindr because it gets attention. Sometimes you have to make a splash to make people pay attention to the things that matter.”

The antiretroviral drug PrEP is taken by people at high risk of HIV transmission, which if used every day has an efficacy rate of 99% among gay and bisexual men. It is a key component of the federal government’s goal to eliminate HIV transmission in Australia by 2030.

Currently PrEP prescriptions, if taken daily, can cost $31.60 a month on the PBS, though Labor’s policy is to reduce this to $25 a month if re-elected. Around 100,000 people in Australia use PrEP and PEP.

The Greens argued that the gap between what the PBS cost is and what people pay at the pharmacy has increased – meaning people have begun paying more for the drug in the past few years.

The Greens’ policy, according to parliamentary budget office costings, would cost taxpayers $18.4m over forward estimates.

Last year there was a temporary shortage of the drug in Australia that resulted in the Therapeutics Goods Administration allowing the import of the drug from overseas.

There were 722 diagnoses of HIV in 2023 in Australia, which was up on the previous year, but still lower than pre-Covid levels and a continued trend of overall decline in diagnoses.

Debatable impact: Albanese and Dutton to face off again but experts question whether showdown will shift votes,"Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton will face off on Wednesday night inside the ABC’s Parramatta studios in the second of four election leaders’ debates.

Albanese was judged the winner of the first encounter, a Sky News-hosted people’s forum in which a crowd of average voters posed questions on topics ranging from housing and the fuel excise to GP costs and the Gaza conflict.

ABC Insiders host and Canberra press gallery veteran David Speers will moderate Wednesday’s showdown, presenting a different set of challenges for the prime minister and the opposition leader.

Leaders’ debates are a feature of each campaign, billed – in particular by the host broadcaster – as make-or-break moments capable of turning the campaign.

But campaign veterans have differing opinions as to how decisive the set-piece events actually are.

Yaron Finkelstein, who was Scott Morrison’s principal private secretary, said for all the hype surrounding leaders’ debates, the contests rarely shifted votes.

“It’s high stakes in the sense they [leaders] think that a mistake will be fatal, because there is a lot of debate hype,” Finkelstein said.

“But of course, as we know, it becomes about the commentary later. But it’s never had a real impact on how people vote. It might reinforce what you already thought, but [it] rarely switches votes.”

Ryan Liddell, who served as chief of staff to the former Labor leader Bill Shorten, said debates were taken “incredibly seriously” because they could shape the agenda for the next phase of the campaign.

Liddell said Joe Biden’s horror show in the first US presidential debate with Donald Trump in 2024 – which hastened his exit from the race – had “stiffed a few spines” in political circles about the risks of “nonchalant debate prep”.

“There is a huge risk of an error being amplified, which is why both sides take them so seriously,” he said.

3:14 Labor and Liberal duelling housing policies, and a diss track – TLDR: Election 2025 – video

Sean Kelly, a former adviser to Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, said as the notional frontrunner in the campaign, Albanese’s goal would be “not stuffing up”.

“I don’t think these debates are quite the events they used to be,” he told ABC’s Afternoon Briefing.

“But I do think making mistakes while the entire press gallery is watching on and ready to turn them into news stories is a huge potential problem.”

The debates are distinct from everyday campaign press conferences and television and radio interviews, requiring a specific type of preparation from a leader and their inner circle.

Albanese has been known to use mock debates as part of his preparation, with a rotating cast of senior Labor colleagues role-playing his Liberal opponent.

Debate day typically involves a morning press conference, allowing the leaders to bunker down in the afternoon ahead of the primetime event.

The leaders must be cognisant of the specific debate format.

The sort of shouting that typifies parliamentary question time is nowhere to be seen in town hall-style debates such as last week’s people’s forum, where Albanese and Dutton made very deliberate attempts to appear personable to average voters.

The leaders’ advisers are constantly updating briefs in the days and weeks prior, foreshadowing the types of questions their boss might face.

Often the topics raised on debate night are predictable.

But the unscripted nature of debates lends itself to a surprise – and it doesn’t always come from the audience.

At a Sky News people’s forum during the 2019 campaign, Morrison famously encroached into Shorten’s section of the stage in an apparent attempt to intimate the Labor leader.

Shorten responded with humour, dubbing Morrison a “classic space invader”.

“They [Morrison’s team] obviously would have war-gamed that, and we had no idea, obviously, what was coming, or anything like that. But television amplifies aggression massively and it looked ridiculous,” Liddell said.

“To Bill’s credit he used humour and ridicule as a way of defusing it and Morrison ends up looking like a goose. It looked weird, which fed into people’s perceptions that Morrison was a bit of a weird unit.”

Shorten won the debate.

A fortnight later, Morrison pulled off his “miracle” election win.",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/15/debatable-impact-albanese-and-dutton-to-face-off-again-but-experts-question-whether-showdown-will-shift-votes,1
"Axing Labor’s free Tafe would mean fewer builders and higher house prices, experts warn","Australia’s construction worker shortage – and prospects for affordable housing – would worsen if Peter Dutton scraps Labor’s free Tafe program, experts warn, pushing housing prices even further out of reach of prospective buyers.

After a video emerged of Liberal frontbencher Sarah Henderson saying the fee-free Tafe policy was “just not working”, the opposition leader was asked on Tuesday if he would cut the scheme – designed to encourage people to work in priority industries like the construction sector.

He replied that the Liberal party had said it was “not supportive of the government’s policy in relation to Tafe”.

Labor’s bill to legislate its $1.5bn fee-free Tafe program, which the opposition voted against, passed in March.

It directs ongoing funding to states and territories from 2027 for at least 100,000 fee-free course places a year, prioritising equity cohorts including First Nations people, women, youth, people out of work or receiving income support, unpaid carers and people with disability and areas of “high workforce demand” such as housing, care, early childhood education and defence.

The Coalition said it had consistently opposed the scheme because it was “badly designed and poorly targeted”.

Roy Green, special innovation adviser at the University of Technology Sydney, said fewer homes would be built if the program ended.

“If you don’t have the skills, you won’t get the resulting supply of houses, and will continue to have housing shortages and high prices and high rent,” Green said.

Australia’s construction industry suffers from a shortage of workers, with 83,000 more skilled tradespeople needed for the country to build the 1.2m new homes planned by the Albanese government, according to the Housing Industry Association (HIA).

Close to 40,000 people had enrolled in construction courses at Tafe with free tuition since 2023, with nearly a further 530,000 enrolling in other subsidised qualifications, the federal government said in January.

The fee-free program had helped people into vocational training who might otherwise have stayed away or were from disadvantaged backgrounds, said Melinda Hildebrandt, a policy fellow at the Mitchell Institute.

“We’re dealing with a pretty crazy cost-of-living crisis right now, so it does actually help,” she said.

The construction sector has persistent problems attracting new trainees and in September 2024 hit its lowest level of new apprentices since 2020, according to the National Centre for Vocational Education Research (NCVER).

But industry bodies have also drawn attention to the sector’s struggle to retain trainees. More than half of those starting construction courses in 2019 have since withdrawn from the courses, NCVER found.

An unknown number of trainees have dropped out of the free Tafe courses, which a Coalition spokesperson highlighted when asked about whether the opposition would remove free Tafe and offer a new program.

“We can do better than Labor’s free Tafe program and under a Dutton Coalition government we will do better,” the spokesperson said, without outlining alternatives.

The major parties announced their competing housing plans this week, in an election focused on cost-of-living policies, particularly housing affordability.

Both major parties plan to pay to keep trainees in the construction sector, with Labor offering wage subsidies and $10,000 incentives for apprentices staying on, while the Coalition would give some businesses up to $12,000 for taking on new apprentices.

HIA said rewarding employers and students for completions would be more effective than free Tafe.

But Nathan Quinn, Carpentry Australia’s head of development, said removing free Tafe entirely would deter people from taking up construction courses.

“You would see a huge drop off and a huge lost opportunity to really meet that workforce demand of the future,” he said.

More supports could help free Tafe get the outcomes the sector needs, he said.

“We’ve got part of the puzzle, right? We just need their surrounding pieces to be in the right place.”",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/16/axing-labors-free-tafe-would-mean-fewer-builders-and-higher-house-prices-experts-warn,1
Millions tune in for three-week live stream of Sweden’s moose migration,"Most of the time, nothing much happens. A wide Nordic river, melting snow still lining its banks, meanders peacefully through a pristine forest of spruce and pine. But this spring, as every spring for the past six years, a lot of people will be glued to it.

When Den stora älgvandringen – variously translated as The Great Moose Migration or The Great Elk Trek – first aired on the public broadcaster SVT’s on-demand platform in 2019, nearly a million people tuned in. Last year, it was 9 million.

This year, who knows? Given the state of the world, a three-week-long, round-the-clock live stream of a few hundred moose gingerly crossing the Ångerman River in northern Sweden to reach their summer pastures could be just what viewers need.

The show’s latest edition launched a full week early on Tuesday because of warmer than usual spring weather. “There are a lot of moose about,” the producer, Stefan Edlund, told SVT. “They’re waiting for us. We’ve had to adjust. But it should be OK.”

The programme’s 15-strong crew, working out of a control room in Umeå, 400 miles (600km) north of Stockholm, had already laid most of their 20,000 meters of cables and positioned their 30-plus remote video and night vision cameras, Edlund said.

Which is just as well, because the show’s fans are more than ready.

Ulla Malmgren, 62, said she had stocked up on coffee and pre-cooked meals for the duration so she did not miss a moment. “Sleep? Forget it. I don’t sleep,” she said.

Malmgren, who is in a Facebook group of 76,000-plus viewers, told the Associated Press she loved the thought that there were “about a million people” watching “all saying about the same thing: ‘Go on! Yes, you can do it!’”

Another fan, William Garp Liljefors, 20, said he had been known to be late for class while the show was on. “I feel relaxed, but at the same time I’m like, ‘Oh, there’s a moose. Oh, what if there’s a moose? I can’t go to the toilet!’” he said.

The show – and its success – are part of a growing trend for “slow television” that some argue was pioneered by the late US pop artist Andy Warhol, whose 1964 film Sleep showed the poet John Giorno sleeping for five hours and 20 minutes.

More recently, the concept took off with the Norwegian broadcaster NRK’s pre-recorded Bergensbanen, which showed, minute by minute, a seven-hour train journey from Bergen to Oslo with archive footage to enliven time spent in the line’s 182 tunnels.

About 20% of Norway’s population tuned in at least once to that. Two years later, roughly half the country’s 5.5 million people watched at least some of NRK’s coverage – live and non-stop, this time – of a 134-hour sea voyage from Bergen to Kirkenes.

Since then the broadcaster has aired at least one slow TV show a year, including 18 hours of salmon swimming upstream, 12 hours of firewood burning, 24 hours of academic lectures on the constitution and a 12-hour knitting marathon.

Broadcasters in Spain, Portugal, France, the UK, Australia and elsewhere have followed suit. In Utrecht, in the Netherlands, a live stream from an underwater camera allows viewers to ring a virtual doorbell and let spawning fish through a lock gate.

Slow TV shows something happening at the rate it is experienced, rather than speeded up through plotting and editing. Its attraction, media experts say, seems to lie precisely in the soothing absence of staged tension and drama.

“It becomes, in a strange way, gripping, because nothing catastrophic is happening, nothing spectacular is happening,” said Annette Hill, a professor of media and communications at Jönköping University in Sweden.

“But something very beautiful is happening in that minute-by-minute moment.”

Espen Ytreberg, a professor of media studies at the University of Oslo, has likened slow TV to a sort of window or “escape valve” from the medium’s usual frenetic pace. “Just when did we come to accept that television should be this accelerated, busy, intense, in your face thing?” he wondered – appropriately, almost a decade ago – in an interview with CBS. “But at some point, that became the norm.”

Just occasionally, of course, stuff does happen. SVT even sends a push alert when the first moose shows up on The Great Moose Migration, and runs an on-screen counter showing how many have managed to cross the river, which is wide and can be perilous.

Last year, the programme’s cameras captured 87 making it safely across. Some do get into difficulties. Undeniably, though, viewers are, most of the time, staring at sky, water and trees. Maybe a duck or two. Wait, is that a moose?",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/15/millions-tune-in-for-three-week-live-stream-of-swedens-moose-migration,1

View image in fullscreen US president-elect Donald Trump meets with Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida. Photograph: Italian Government/Reuters The summit will be closely watched. On one hand, it is an ideal opportunity for Meloni to demonstrate an affinity with Trump, with whom her natural political tendencies lie, while boosting her credentials as a conduittowards more meaningful dialogue. On the other, it will be a delicate balancing act for the prime minister, who also knows she must be careful to maintain her allegiance to Italy’s EU partners. Behind the scenes, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and Meloni are understood to have discussed a gameplan. Still, the solo trip has caused anxiety among EU allies, with the French industry minister, Marc Ferracci, warning last week that it threatened to undermine European unity against the US tariffs. Their concerns are not without reason. Meloni, a former Eurosceptic, defended a blistering attack against European values by Trump’s deputy, JD Vance, at the Munich Security Conference in February.

View image in fullscreen Protesters attempt to march to the office of the Hungarian President but are stopped at Chain Bridge by riot police in Budapest, Hungary. Photograph: Balint Szentgallay/NurPhoto/REX/Shutterstock On Monday, Hungary’s rightwing populist government, led by Viktor Orbán, voted through a constitutional amendment backing the ban, in what rights campaigners described as a “significant escalation” in the government’s efforts to chip away at human rights. The university remains committed to inclusion, the petition noted. “As university lecturers and researchers, we protest against this curtailment of basic rights,” it said. It also sought to highlight the worrying precedent set by the ban. “The government’s spurious claim, all too familiar from history, to protect our children sets the stage for the curtailment of the freedom of assembly of arbitrarily designated groups – in the first instance LGBTQI communities – as well as their surveillance and punishment.” Staff at the internationally renowned university had decided to speak out as “many of our students and staff rightly feel threatened by discriminatory, arbitrary legislation and stigmatisation,” the petition noted. The signatories said they would work to ensure that students or employees belonging to the LGBTQ+ community would feel free to speak up when it comes to matters concerning themselves or the wider university community. “It is especially important to take this responsibility at a time when our institutions and communities are under increasing government pressure and similar attacks are taking place in other countries,” the petition said. Rights campaigners have called on the European Commission to launch a procedure against the Hungarian government, arguing that the legal changes – believed to be the first of their kind in the EU’s modern history – are a breach of EU law.

‘It’s sheer terrorism’: Sumy buries dead after Russia’s Palm Sunday attack,"On a warm spring day relatives gathered to say goodbye to Viktor Boiko and his wife, Olha. Their open coffins were laid out next to one other. Viktor wore his best suit. Olha was in a flowery blouse, with carnations heaped around her slippered feet. A priest sang prayers. Gravediggers lowered the couple into the ground, and shovelled earth on top. It landed with a percussive thud.

“Give me a weapon. Any weapon. I want to kill those butchers in Moscow,” said Viktor’s brother-in-law Anatolii Prykhodko, as his wife stood sobbing next to him. “They have murdered so many people. Adults, kids, peaceful citizens. If you lose a house or a car in a war, you can get it back. If you lose a person, a loved one, they are gone for ever.”

View image in fullscreen Sumy state university’s congress centre building was badly damaged by the attack. Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The Guardian

On Sunday morning, the Boikos were on their way to church to celebrate Palm Sunday. Like most hard-up pensioners, they went by public transport. A ride costs eight hryvnia (15p). Their bus, No 62, was driving down Petropavlivska Street in the centre of Sumy, north-eastern Ukraine. On either side were elegant buildings belonging to Sumy state university. It was 10.23am.

A Russian Iskander missile carrying cluster munitions plunged down from the sky, exploding next to the bus. Shrapnel engulfed the Boikos, other passengers and people in the street strolling past cafes and shops. The couple died instantly. Another missile hit the university’s conference centre, 200 metres away, punching through its glass atrium and balcony.

Rescuers saw an apocalyptic scene. Bodies lay sprawled on the ground, cars burned, smoke billowed. The blast ripped a hole in the university’s economics and business department. It blew out the windows and wooden doors from the 19th-century institute of applied physics across the road. Fragments flew through the institute’s garden, shredding tulips and roses. The spot was a popular backdrop for wedding photos.

On Tuesday, people visited the scene to lay flowers as firefighters perched on a shattered roof. “It was Palm Sunday, a holiday, a day off,” one Sumy resident, Tetyana, explained. “The weather had recently warmed up and people were on their way to church. We have a tradition in Ukraine that we buy willow branches.” She added: “This is a huge sorrow for the whole city. We are grieving. In my opinion this isn’t an act of war. It’s sheer terrorism.”

Among the dead were two children. One was 11-year-old Maksym Martynenko, who died with his parents, Mykola and Natalia. There were cuddly toys at the spot where he perished, including a bear and a hippo. Someone had left a plastic football with “To Max” written on it. The organist at Sumy’s philharmonic concert hall, Olena Kohut, was killed nearby on her way to a rehearsal. Other victims were students, teachers, a notary and the bus driver.

Sumy is situated a mere 16 miles (25km) from the Russian border. It is home to soldiers and civilians. Residents are used to frequent drone and rocket attacks, and to the constant wail of air raid sirens. Sunday’s double-tap strike, though, was terrible. It was the most egregious Russian attack this year, leaving 35 dead and 129 injured. Eleven people remain in a critical condition. There are 15 wounded children.

Asked for his reaction, Donald Trump appeared to downplay the latest Russian atrocity, calling it “a mistake”. Subsequently, he blamed Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, and Joe Biden, the previous US president, by falsely claiming they “started” the war with Russia. Serhii Khvostov, the head of the damaged conference centre in Sumy, was unimpressed. “Trump is a mistake. This is an act by stupid and angry Russians. There’s no logic to it,” he said. “It’s easy to look away. But the world has to understand what is happening here.”

Khvostov gave a tour of the ruined building. The missile blew a four-metre hole in the ground floor and careened into the basement, a community theatre space. A children’s show was due to take place there at 11am, shortly before the attack. Jagged pieces from the Iskander missile landed amid prepared sandwiches, costumes and a collection of puppets, including a dragon and Kermit the Frog. Large holes dinted the venue’s black walls.

“It was a miracle nobody was killed,” Khvostov said. After hearing the explosion, he called the centre’s elderly security guard. There was no answer, so he ran to the building. The guard was concussed but OK, and had managed to drag one of Khvostov’s colleagues from the administration’s office, pushing him out of a broken window. A cleaner also survived. No one else was inside. Several people drinking coffee from a mobile kiosk were injured.

On Tuesday, staff swept away glass, ducking to avoid dangling bits of ceiling. Khvostov’s office was a mess. There were broken computers and desks and a toppled-over safe. “We can’t find the key,” he said. “It’s too early to say if this place can be rebuilt. I hope so.” Outside, a JCB digger scooped piles of debris into a lorry. A tow truck removed a damaged car. Its owner, Tetyana, said: “My windows blew in and my neighbour was hurt. I gave her a tourniquet.”

The theatre’s founder and director, Volodymyr Niankin, said one of his friends was planning to leave Sumy due to the attack. Niankin said he himself would stay, to take care of his ailing grandmother. Of Trump and Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, he said: “I think they are stupid old men. They are representatives of a past cold war generation, when it was just the US and the USSR. It seems their plan is to divide up the world between them.”

At the institute of applied physics, a clean-up was under way. Volunteers tidied the flowerbeds. The explosion damaged a chandelier in an upstairs lecture room and a charcoal portrait of a Sumy physicist, which had been hanging in a corridor. A whiteboard with an equation on it survived unscathed. Next to the entrance, a Quartz wall clock had stopped at the exact moment of impact: 10.23am and 40 seconds.

Serhii Lebedynskyi, a senior researcher, examined his smashed office with his wife, Yulia. A shelf of physics books was covered in a layer of thick dust. Ornate plasterwork on the ceiling had disappeared. “We were planning to go into town with our small son on Sunday morning. He decided he didn’t want to leave the house. This probably saved us. We heard an enormous bang,” Lebedynskyi said. He added: “For more than 10 years the Russians have behaved like terrorists.”

An American volunteer, Karl Ahlgren, said the Russians had known exactly what they were doing when they fired two missiles into a crowded city centre. “What Trump says is atrocious and unconscionable,” he said. “It’s clear he listens to Russian propaganda. I don’t know if it comes from Vladimir Putin or from [Trump’s special envoy] Steve Witkoff. There was no mistake here. The second strike was meant to kill rescuers.”

On Tuesday, Ukraine’s armed forces carried out a form of revenge. The country’s military said it had successfully hit the headquarters of a Russian missile brigade responsible for Sunday’s carnage. “[A base] of the 448th missile brigade of the Russian occupiers was hit, a secondary detonation of ammunition was recorded. The results of the strike are being clarified,” it said in a statement.

Back at Sumy’s cemetery, a gravedigger spoke fondly of Kohut, describing her as a talented and popular organist. “She was my friend. A very democratic person. She treated everyone the same way, whether you were important or not,” Valeriy Rodenko said. Rodenko said he had worked for seven years as a carpenter at the city’s philharmonic concert hall. “I got to know Olena well. She was a wonderful person. A bright spirit,” he said.

French prisons hit by wave of attacks after clampdown on drug traffickers,"France’s national terrorism office has launched an investigation into a wave of apparently coordinated attacks at multiple prisons across the country believed to be linked to a government clampdown on drug traffickers.

Gunmen with automatic weapons opened fire on the entrance to Toulon prison in southern France in the early hours of Tuesday, while in recent days cars have been set alight outside four other jails, and in Marseille a residential building housing prison guards was attacked.

The attacks came as the French parliament prepares to approve a new law increasing the power of police investigating drug dealers, toughening prison conditions for convicted traffickers and creating a new prosecutors’ office responsible for investigating organised crime.

Soaring cocaine imports from South America to Europe have sparked drug-linked violence in France, where seizures of the drug are at a historic high, police say. The drug gangs traditionally based in cities such as Marseille have expanded into smaller regional towns unused to drug violence.

The justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, was due to visit Toulon prison on Tuesday afternoon in a show of solidarity with staff. Darmanin said he was determined to stamp out drug kingpins’ capacity to operate from behind bars and had ordered the building of two new high-security jails to hold more than 700 prisoners.

“Attempts have been made to intimidate staff in several prisons ranging from burning vehicles to firing automatic weapons. The French Republic is facing up to the problem of drug trafficking and taking measures that will massively disrupt the criminal networks,” Darmanin wrote on X.

He added: “The Republic is confronted with drug trafficking and is taking measures that will deeply disturb criminal networks. It is being challenged and will be firm and courageous.”

Prisons in Marseille, Aix-en-Provence, Valence, Nîmes, Luynes, Villepinte and Nanterre were also targeted. Staff unions said burnt vehicles had been found in prison car parks for several days in the runup to what appeared to be Monday night’s coordinated assault. Cars have also been set alight outside the National School of Prison Administration.

The legislation before the French parliament would allow prisons to hold convicted drug dealers in isolation, deprive them of collective walks and access to family life units, tap their phones and limit calls. Darmanin has also proposed giving the justice minister the power to decide whether solitary confinement orders – which must currently be renewed every three months – can be applied for up to four years, and applied not only to convicted drug traffickers but also those awaiting trial.

The appointment of the National Anti-Terrorism Prosecutor’s Office (PNAT) to oversee the investigation, as opposed to the organised crime unit, suggests police believe the attacks may be the work of a militant group. PNAT said it would be working with the country’s interior intelligence agency.

The interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, said the attacks were “unacceptable” and ordered increased police protection of prisons and staff.

In February – as he announced record cocaine seizures of 47 tonnes in the first 11 months of last year, more than double that seized in 2023 – Retailleau said France had been hit by a “white tsunami” that had rewritten the rules of the criminal landscape.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/15/french-prisons-hit-by-wave-of-attacks-after-clampdown-on-drug-traffickers,1
EU mulls plan to let importers break Russian gas contracts without penalties,"The European Commission is considering plans that would allow European companies to break long-term Russian gas contracts without paying penalties to Moscow, it has been reported.

Citing three officials with knowledge of the plan, the Financial Times reported that the commission was studying the possibility of allowing companies to declare force majeure, which would absolve importers of their obligations to pay penalty fees for ending contracts.

The plans are said to be part of a roadmap on how the EU will rid itself of Russian fossil fuels by 2027, a document scheduled to be published on 6 May, following repeated delays.

A commission spokesperson declined to comment.

The commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said last month at a press conference, when asked about the delays, that she was committed to phasing out Russian gas, saying it was “an absolute must”.

EU leaders promised to end dependency on Russian oil and gas in 2022, amid widespread concern that these revenues were funding Russia’s war against Ukraine.

The EU imported just under 52bn cubic metres of Russian gas in 2024, compared with 150bn cubic metres in 2021, according to EU statistics. Last year, however, Europe bought a record amount of Russian liquified natural gas, and Russian gas imports increased by 18%, according to energy thinktank Ember.

Pipeline imports have also continued, despite the end of gas flows through Ukraine on 1 January 2025 when a transit deal expired. In February 2025, the EU received 56m cubic metres a day via the TurkStream pipeline, an 11% monthly increase. “These increases could threaten the 2027 Russian gas phaseout pathway,” Ember said, also referring to liquified natural gas (LNG).

The US is Europe’s biggest supplier of LNG and officials have expressed interest in buying even more of the ultra-cold shipped fuel since Donald Trump returned to the White House.

Energy executives are openly talking about resuming Russian gas imports. “If there is a reasonable peace in Ukraine, we could go back to flows of 60bn cubic metres, maybe 70, annually, including LNG,” Didier Holleaux, the executive vice-president at France’s Engie, told Reuters in an interview. The French government partly owns Engie, which used to be among the biggest buyers of Gazprom’s gas.

In Germany, businesses are also said to be interested in restarting Russian gas imports, which used to provide 55% of its supply and helped factories run at competitive prices. “Reopening pipelines would reduce prices more than any current subsidy programmes,” Christof Guenther, the managing director of InfraLeuna chemical park, home to Dow Chemical and Shell, told Reuters. He added that many colleagues agreed on the need to go back to Russian gas but said it was a “taboo topic”.

However, the market volatility in the wake of the US tariff moves has hit Russia’s oil exports and earnings in recent weeks.

According to Bloomberg, crude flows from Russian ports in the four weeks to 13 April fell to 3.13m barrels a day, their lowest since February, while the gross value of shipments dropped by about $80m (£60.5m) to $1.29bn a week, the lowest since mid-July 2023.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/15/eu-could-end-penalties-for-companies-that-break-russian-gas-contracts,1
Trump’s ‘chosen one’ Giorgia Meloni heads to Washington to play delicate balancing act,"Sitting alone at the end of a dinner party, under chandeliers, next to a table with white roses and leftover wine, Giorgia Meloni and Donald Trump are locked in conversation.

It is early December and they are pictured in an opulent dining room of the Élysée Palace, where the French president, Emmanuel Macron, hosted guests after the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral.

It was the first time Italy’s far-right prime minister had met Trump, a rendezvous that followed years of her nurturing relations with his Make America Great Again (Maga) militants. For all we know, they could have been bonding over a shared disdain for French cuisine.

Whatever was discussed, however, Meloni appears to be holding sway. Trump later described her as “a real live wire” and someone he could work with “to straighten out the world a little bit”. He may well have received positive reports on her from Elon Musk, with whom the Italian prime minister has met on several occasions and whom she has called “a brilliant man”.

As the relationship progressed, Meloni paid a flying visit to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago golf club in Florida a month later, and was the only European leader to attend his inauguration as US president.

Now her influence over Trump is to be put to the test when the pair reunite in Washington on Thursday for their first bilateral summit. Meloni is the first European leader to meet Trump since he paused some of his planned tariff hikes last week.

The summit will be closely watched. On one hand, it is an ideal opportunity for Meloni to demonstrate an affinity with Trump, with whom her natural political tendencies lie, while boosting her credentials as a conduit towards more meaningful dialogue. On the other, it will be a delicate balancing act for the prime minister, who also knows she must be careful to maintain her allegiance to Italy’s EU partners.

Behind the scenes, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and Meloni are understood to have discussed a gameplan. Still, the solo trip has caused anxiety among EU allies, with the French industry minister, Marc Ferracci, warning last week that it threatened to undermine European unity against the US tariffs.

Their concerns are not without reason. Meloni, a former Eurosceptic, defended a blistering attack against European values by Trump’s deputy, JD Vance, at the Munich Security Conference in February. She will be back in Rome on Friday to meet JD Vance, who is in Italy for the Easter weekend.

On Ukraine, despite going along with allies during Joe Biden’s US administration, her Brothers of Italy party abstained, for the first time, on a European parliament resolution in March reaffirming support for Kyiv against Russian aggression. She has been lukewarm over the “coalition of the willing” advocated by Macron and Keir Starmer.

Kathleen van Brempt, a Belgian socialist MEP and vice-chair of the European parliament’s committee on international trade, said the worries about Meloni were understandable.

“But we need to be a bit more nuanced,” van Brempt said. “Meloni knows she needs the support of the council, commission and the parliament in all the talks she has. She can’t go any further than what has been agreed upon. The first goal is getting somebody on the other side of the negotiating table. That is exactly what Meloni will try to do in Washington.”

Antonio Giordano, a Brothers of Italy MP and general secretary of the European Conservatives and Reformists party (ECR), who attended last year’s Republican national convention in the US, said Meloni’s priority would be to have a frank conversation with Trump – hopefully one that would break the EU-US deadlock.

“That’s Meloni’s character – when there is a problem, she tends to face it directly, to talk about it,” said Giordano. “This is the first objective of the discussion, regardless of the possible results.”

Giordano said that while Brothers of Italy, a party with neofascist origins, has a natural closeness with Trump’s Republicans, Meloni was good at “reaching a significant level of empathy with everyone”.

“She did a great job with Joe Biden too,” he said. “Obviously, she will be representing Italy, but she has also been clear about Europe being compact. At the same time, she has always insisted that Europe maintains an open dialogue [with the US] and that we do not close the door to a natural ally.”

Meloni has no choice but to be cautious. With Italy being the EU’s third largest exporter to the US, she will be under pressure to protect Italian business and investment interests. She could, some say, try to exempt domestic specialities such as pasta, cheese and wine from the tariffs.

Another key issue will be the US’s biggest trade rival: China. Meloni travelled to the country last year to reset trade ties after withdrawing Italy from the controversial Belt and Road infrastructure investment scheme. However, she is expected to distance herself from attempts in the EU to forge closer ties with China amid its tariff war with the US.

At home, Meloni is also under pressure to maintain unity in her government coalition, especially with Matteo Salvini, recently re-confirmed as leader of the far-right League, challenging her with his explicit support for Trump and criticism of the EU’s policies on Ukraine.

But however much their political instincts are entwined, Meloni might need to lower expectations of her capacity to be Trump’s “whisperer” in Europe.

“She has created an illusion of being Trump’s ‘chosen one’, but it is more and more clear that this is not happening,” said Sandro Gozi, an MEP with the Renew Europe group and Italy’s former Europe minister. “Trump sees the EU as an obstacle to his imperialistic strategy and he’s not doing anything to hide it. But if he wants to negotiate with us, it will be through von der Leyen and not Meloni.”

True to character, as Meloni sidles up to Trump, she has also been engaging with some of her Italian opposition, recently attending the congress of Azione, a liberal centrist party.

The party’s leader, Carlo Calenda, said Meloni was “at a crossroads”, faced with the dilemma of choosing between the US and Europe.

“I told her this when she came to the congress,” he said. “There is an aspiring autocrat in the White House who considers us enemies – his plan is to break up Europe. But our future is indissolubly linked to Europe, and Italy must be part of the decisions that are taken together. I don’t think Meloni has made that choice yet.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/15/trumps-chosen-one-giorgia-meloni-heads-to-washington-to-play-delicate-balancing-act,1
Trump envoy demands Iran eliminate nuclear programme in apparent U-turn,"Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, has announced Iran must totally eliminate its nuclear programme, seeming to reverse the policy he had articulated on Fox News only 12 hours earlier that would have allowed Iran to enrich uranium at a low level for civilian use.

The switch to a more hardline policy is likely to make it much harder for the US to reach a negotiated agreement with Tehran, bringing back the threat of an attack on Iran’s nuclear sites.

In a further switch, it was agreed that the next round of indirect US-Iran talks, due to start on Saturday, will continue to be in Oman and the venue would not switch to Italy as proposed by the US.

In a statement posted to social media on Tuesday Witkoff said: “A deal with Iran will only be completed if it is a Trump deal. Any final arrangement must set in place a framework for peace, stability and prosperity in the Middle East – meaning that Iran must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponisation program. It is imperative for the world that we create a tough fair deal that will endure, and that is what President Trump has asked me to do.”

The previous day on Fox News, the special envoy had said “the conversation with the Iranians” would concern uranium enrichment at 3.67 % for civil nuclear purposes.

“In some circumstances they are enriching at 60% and at others at 20%. That cannot be,” he said. “You do not need to run, as they claim, a civil nuclear programme where you are enriching past 3.67%. This is going to be much about verification on the enrichment programme and then ultimately verification on weaponisation – that includes the type of missiles they have stockpiled there and the trigger for a bomb.”

Witkoff’s two positions are hard to reconcile – unless he is trying to distinguish between an interim deal that reduces Iranian uranium enrichment to civilian levels and a final agreement that eliminates its nuclear programme entirely.

It also possible Trump has faced a backlash from Iran hawks who warned that Witkoff’s negotiating stance was largely re-establishing the nuclear deal Barack Obama had agreed with Iran in 2015, from which Trump withdrew the US in 2018 saying it was unenforceable.

Witkoff’s apparent volte face may also be seen as another example of chaotic foreign policymaking, in which the administration battles behind the president’s back and he either does not focus on the policy details or does not understand the choices he is allowing to be made on his behalf.

Witkoff, a man with no diplomatic experience and charged with producing diplomatic breakthroughs in Gaza, Ukraine and Iran, has never tried to portray himself as anything than Trump’s messenger. He would have thought the proposals he aired in the weekend talks in Oman and on Fox News were those of the president.

Iran has repeatedly demanded the right to maintain a civil nuclear programme, meaning the latest iteration of US thinking will cause consternation in Tehran and could strengthen hardliners, who maintain the US cannot be trusted.

A rare consensus had broken out in Tehran that the talks between Witkoff and the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, could result in some US sanctions being lifted as part of the most positive development in relations between Iran and the US in a decade.

Medics killed and wounded in Israeli attack on Gaza hospital,"A medic has been killed in an Israeli missile strike on a hospital in Gaza, just as the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was making a visit to the war-torn territory.

The attack on Tuesday came two days after another major hospital was targeted, fuelling warnings from the UN that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is now the worst it has been since conflict began.

According to medical staff, the latest strike hit the entrance to the Kuwaiti field hospital in al-Muwasi, near the city of Khan Younis. One medic died and nine others were wounded.

Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are living in the area, mostly in ragged makeshift tents alongside sand dunes. They left their homes after Israeli forces resumed conflict and seized swathes of southern Gaza, including Rafah city, which Palestinians are banned from entering.

On Tuesday, Netanyahu made a rare visit to Gaza. Israeli forces have continued their air and ground offensive in the territory since the collapse of the ceasefire in March. The visit was confirmed by the prime minister’s office, who said he had visited troops in northern Gaza.

Just two days previously, an Israeli missile partially destroyed al-Ahli hospital, which was the only facility still providing critical care in northern Gaza. Doctors said the blasts had left the hospital barely operational and unable to carry out surgeries or accept any more patients.

António Guterres, the UN secretary general, said he was “deeply alarmed” by the incident, stressing that hospitals were protected under international humanitarian law.

Israel has repeatedly targeted hospitals in Gaza over the past 18 months, alleging that they are used by Hamas to conceal terrorist activities. Israeli forces claimed al-Ahli was being used as a “command and control” centre by Hamas, an allegation the group denied. Paramedics carrying out rescue operations in Gaza have also been targeted.

Doctors working in Gaza warned that the situation for provision of medical care in Gaza was at breaking point. Dr Mohammad Zahir, an emergency doctor at Gaza’s Indonesia hospital, said that if the aid blockade continued, severely ill children, cancer and kidney patients would all soon lose their lives.

“We are living through a severe crisis alongside the broader humanitarian catastrophe,” said Zahir. “Inside the hospital, there is not only a lack of resources, but a massive shortage of essential medicines and medical supplies. There is also a shortage of ambulances, medications for chronic illnesses and cancer patients, surgical supplies, and even hospital beds – all due to the ongoing closure of the border crossings.”

The UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs said the situation in Gaza was “likely the worst it has been in the 18 months since the outbreak of hostilities”.

Since the collapse of the ceasefire with Hamas, Israel has blocked all aid to the territory since 2 March, resulting in critical shortages of food, water, fuel and medicine. Staff at Nasser hospital, one of the largest hospitals in Gaza – which is only partially functional after being hit in an airstrike last month – reported running out of gauze and burn creams this week.

It is the longest period that Israel has denied aid to Gaza and human rights groups said the tactic – meant to pressure Hamas into releasing the remaining hostages it holds – amounted to a war crime.

Raeda Hijazi, living in a tent in the humanitarian zone in western Gaza with her four children, said they regularly survived only on salt and bread and had no choice but to drink contaminated water.

“There is no fuel to purify or pump water, and even the available food is contaminated,” she said. “Vegetables are completely unaffordable. I cook using burning plastic, even though I know it contains carcinogenic substances, but there’s no alternative. Insects are everywhere in the tents due to the garbage accumulating in the streets. Words are not enough to describe the suffering.”

Khetam Abu Ouda, 49, living in Abasan Al-Kabira, east of Khan Younis, said he and his family had been displaced 20 times since the start of the war. They recently returned to the rubble of their home but were sharing it with 30 other displaced people and feared that as water was running out, they would soon have to move again. He said said aid groups were no longer distributing food.

“The closure of crossings will lead to a slow and gradual death for the people here unless a radical solution is reached and the war is stopped,” said Ouda.

Israel has also resumed its airstrikes and ground operations in Gaza, displacing about 400,000 people and leading to a surge in civilian casualties, with 1,600 killed since March alone.

Speaking to Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper, an unnamed security official claimed the strategy was working and would force Hamas to agree to a deal on the hostages.

“The military pressure is having an impact,” said the official. “They have a shortage of gas and the food and the fuel will run out in a few weeks. The big achievement of the residents’ return to the northern Gaza Strip has been erased. That’s rattled them.”

Pressure has been mounting on Netanyahu’s government to secure the release of the remaining 58 hostages in Gaza, 24 of whom are believed to be alive. Thousands of former and reservist soldiers, as well as over 250 former Mossad agents, gave their backing to a letter calling for an end to the war, accusing Netanyahu of putting the lives of the hostages at risk for his own political gain.

As Israel launched more missiles in Gaza on Tuesday, a Hamas armed wing spokesperson said on Telegram that they had lost contact with the group holding Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, who has been held captive in Gaza for more than 550 days, after a “direct strike” on his location.

Alexander had appeared alive and agitated in a Hamas propaganda video released over the weekend in which he accused the “disgusting Israeli government” of deserting him and said he was “collapsing mentally and physically”.

Reports emerged this week that Israel had put forward a ceasefire deal with Hamas that included releasing half of the living hostages. However, on Tuesday a Palestinian source told the BBC that Hamas had rejected the deal as it did not include a commitment to end the war or withdraw IDF forces from Gaza.

Israeli’s offensive in response to the attacks by Hamas on southern Israel on 7 October 2023 has now claimed 51,000 lives, according to the Gaza health ministry. The count does not differentiate between civilians or combatants but women and children make up more than half of the dead.

Earlier this month, a group of UN experts said Israel’s actions in Gaza were leading to the “destruction of Palestinian life”.

“If they are not killed by bombs or bullets, they slowly suffocate for lack of basic means of survival,” they said. “The only difference is the means and speed of death.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/15/medics-killed-and-wounded-in-israeli-attack-on-gaza-hospital,1
The Gaza paramedic killings: a visual timeline,"23 March

At 4.20am, a Red Crescent ambulance on its way to collect people injured by an airstrike in Rafah comes under Israeli fire in Hashashin. Two paramedics are killed.

One survivor, Munther Abed, is detained and interrogated. A few hours later, a convoy including ambulances, a fire truck, health ministry vehicles and a UN car is dispatched to recover the bodies of the two paramedics. It also comes under fire. Two health ministry vehicles drive away but contact is lost with the rest of the convoy. Two ambulances sent from Rafah also disappear.

Six days earlier, Israel had ended a two-month-old ceasefire and resumed its military campaign against Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza with heavy aerial bombing and ground operations.

24 March

Gaza’s civil defence agency says it has not heard from the missing people. Access to the site is blocked by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

26 March

A convoy of vehicles carrying officials from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) tries and fails to access the site. While en route, the Ocha team see a woman being shot, the bullet hitting her in the back of the head, and a man who is trying to retrieve her also being shot. The woman’s body is recovered and put into a UN vehicle.

27 March

The Ocha team finally make it to the site. They report finding the ambulances, the UN vehicle and the fire truck crushed and partially buried. The body of a civil defence worker is recovered from under the fire truck, but the recovery mission has to withdraw as the situation becomes unsafe.

The civil defence agency says it has accessed the site and found the body of its team leader there, as well as an ambulance and the Red Crescent’s fire truck, which it says has been “reduced to a pile of scrap metal”.

30 March

Ocha officials and Red Crescent workers return to the site and find the bodies of eight Red Crescent workers, the five other civil defence responders and one UN staff member buried in a mass grave. A ninth Red Crescent worker remains unaccounted for.

31 March

The burials are postponed pending autopsies. The head of Ocha, Tom Fletcher, says the dead were found buried by their wrecked and well-marked vehicles. “They were killed by Israeli forces while trying to save lives,” Fletcher says. “We demand answers and justice.”

The IDF claims its soldiers opened fire on the vehicles because they were “advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency signals” and alleges, without providing evidence, that Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants were among those killed. None were reported to be in the mass grave.

1 April

Two witnesses tell the Guardian that some of the bodies recovered from the grave had had their hands or feet tied, suggesting they were shot after being detained. A Red Crescent official says Israeli soldiers could be heard – over a phone line that was open to one of the paramedics at the time of the convoy shooting – ordering restraints to detain apparent survivors from the convoy.

2 April

A forensics consultant who examined five of the bodies says there is evidence of execution-style killing in some cases based on the “specific and intentional” location of shots taken at close range. The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, says Gaza has become the world’s most dangerous place for humanitarian workers and calls for those responsible for the killings to be held accountable.

3 April

The Israeli military says it is investigating the killings. It maintains that “terrorists” were advancing in the ambulances.

Abed, the survivor, tells the Guardian he was detained and beaten and had to watch as one ambulance and rescue vehicle after another approached the scene and came under intense gunfire. He says he witnessed the wreckage being buried by military bulldozers, and that he saw the missing Red Crescent worker, Assad al-Nsasrah, alive and in Israeli detention. Abed says that after several hours of Israeli interrogation he was released and left to walk homewards.

Footage emerges that contradicts the official Israeli version of events. Found on the phone of one of the victims, which had been buried with his body, and first published by the New York Times, it shows a convoy of ambulances and a fire truck driving along a dirt road, clearly marked with official insignia and with their red and blue emergency vehicle lights flashing.

The IDF admits in a press briefing that its first version of events was “mistaken” and says it is launching a thorough investigation, though the unnamed military briefer sticks to its insistence that “there were terrorists” at the scene of the incident. No evidence to support the claim is presented.

The brother of one of the paramedic victims, Saleh Moamer, tells the Guardian there were “marks from restraints on Saleh’s wrists where the Israeli army had bound him”.

The Red Crescent says autopsies conducted on those killed on 23 March show they were shot in the upper body with “intent to kill”. Germany, one of Israel’s strongest supporters in Europe, calls for a full investigation of the incident.

12 April

IDF confirms that the soldiers involved in the incident were from its Golani Brigade. At the time, the brigade was under the control of the Armoured 14th Brigade, whose commander, Brig Gen Yehuda Vach, is reported by Haaretz to have told troops “there are no innocents in Gaza”. In a video of Golani troops being briefed before their redeployment to Gaza earlier this month, aired by Israel’s Channel 14, a battalion commander tells the soldiers: “Anyone you encounter there is an enemy. You identify anyone, you eliminate him.”

A senior military intelligence source tells the Guardian that Unit 504, a military intelligence team with a reputation for cruelty and reckless behaviour including torture, was also present during the attack.

Iran expected to resist US plan to move uranium stockpile to third country,"Iran is expected to resist a US proposal to transfer its stockpile of highly enriched uranium to a third country – such as Russia – as part of Washington’s effort to scale back Tehran’s civil nuclear programme and prevent it from being used to develop a nuclear weapon.

The issue, seen as one of the key stumbling blocks to a future agreement, was raised in the initial, largely indirect, talks held in Muscat, Oman, between Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, and Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff.

Iran is arguing the stockpile, amassed over the past four years, should remain in Iran under the strict supervision of the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency. Tehran sees this as a precaution, or a form of insurance in case a future US administration withdraws from the agreement, as Donald Trump did in 2018 when he rejected the 2015 deal brokered by Barack Obama.

Tehran says that if the stockpile was to leave Iran and the US pulled out of the deal, it would have to start from scratch in enriching uranium to higher purity – effectively punishing Iran for a breach committed by Washington.

Although the bulk of the exchanges in Muscat were held indirectly between the Iranian and US delegations, with Oman acting as the intermediary, direct meetings between Witkoff and Araghchi also took place.

Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister, has agreed to host the next round of talks on Saturday in Rome, in a move seen as a political gesture by Trump towards Italy. It also serves to marginalise the main European powers in the Iran negotiations, with Oman continuing to act as the mediator. The US vice-president, JD Vance, will also be in Rome over the Easter weekend.

During the initial nuclear talks in 2015, Italy felt it was excluded from the process, with France, Germany and the UK – the so-called “E3” – representing European interests at the talks.

Mohamed Amersi, of the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said: “Meloni is an interesting choice since Meloni seems to be the European leader that has the best personal line to Trump, more than France, Germany and the UK. If Italy hosts the meeting it begs the question of the future role of the E3 in the US-Iran dialogue.”

Iran is negotiating under the threat of not just further sanctions but a potential military attack on its nuclear sites by the US.

With the Iranian economy in decline, Tehran is eager to attract direct investment by lifting US sanctions. Discussions have already started on potential insurance options for companies looking to invest in Iran, in case of a further breakdown in US relations. After the 2018 withdrawal and the imposition of sanctions on foreign companies trading with Iran, the EU was unable to devise a viable way of protecting businesses that wanted to invest in Iran.

Trump has so far excluded other aspects of the US-Iran relationship from the talks, such as Tehran’s “destabilising regional behaviour”, a decision that has confounded both Israel and anti-regime hawks in Washington. The US may seek some form of Iranian assurance that it will not use its influence to interfere in the sovereignty of other states. Iran, however, argues it is Israel making land grabs in Syria, Lebanon and Palestine.

Iran’s influence in the region has been weakened by the fall of the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, Israel’s assaults on Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and US attacks on Yemen. Iran’s oil export fleet is also facing increasing sanctions pressure from the US president.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/15/iran-expected-resist-us-plan-move-uranium-stockpile-third-country,1
Tulip Siddiq decries Bangladesh arrest warrant as ‘politically motivated smear’,"The former City minister Tulip Siddiq has said an arrest warrant issued against her in Bangladesh over allegations she illegally received a plot of land from her aunt, the country’s ousted former prime minister, is a “politically motivated smear campaign”.

Speaking to reporters on Monday, the Hampstead and Highgate MP said: “No one from the Bangladeshi authorities has contacted me. The entire time they’ve done trial by media. My lawyers proactively wrote to the Bangladeshi authorities, they never responded.

“I’m sure you’ll understand I can’t dignify this politically motivated smear campaign with any … comments. It’s a completely politically motivated smear campaign, trying to harass me. There is no evidence that I’ve done anything wrong.”

According to Bangladeshi media reports, a judge issued the warrant for 53 people connected to Sheikh Hasina, Siddiq’s aunt, who stepped down and left the country in August last year after a violent crackdown on protests.

There is no formal extradition treaty between the UK and Bangladesh.

A representative for Siddiq said there was “no basis at all for any charges to be made against her, and there is absolutely no truth in any allegation that she received a plot of land in Dhaka through illegal means”.

Siddiq resigned as economic secretary to the Treasury in January, citing the risk of becoming a distraction and saying the government was being harmed by the furore over her use of properties given to her and her family by allies of Hasina’s government.

Keir Starmer’s ethics adviser, Laurie Magnus, did not deem her to have broken any rules over her use of the homes and found no evidence to suggest that any of Siddiq’s assets were derived from anything other than legitimate means.

He did, however, find a lack of records and said lapse of time meant he had “not been able to obtain comprehensive comfort in relation to all the UK property-related matters”.

Bangladesh’s anti-corruption commission (ACC) has alleged that Siddiq, 42, received a 670 sq metre plot in the diplomatic zone of the capital, Dhaka, through ties to the country’s former rulers, according to the Sunday Telegraph.

The allegation is that Siddiq persuaded her aunt to allocate three plots of land in the exclusive enclave for her family members, including her mother, Sheikh Rehana, her brother Radwan and her younger sister Azmina. The family are all based in Britain.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/apr/14/tulip-siddiq-decries-bangladesh-arrest-warrant-as-politically-motivated-smear,1
Arrest warrant issued in Bangladesh for UK MP Tulip Siddiq,"An arrest warrant for the former City minister Tulip Siddiq has been issued in Bangladesh with a new allegation accusing her of illegally receiving a plot of land from her aunt, the ousted former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.

Bangladeshi media reported the warrant was issued by a judge for 53 people connected to Hasina, including Siddiq. There is no formal extradition treaty between the UK and Bangladesh.

Siddiq’s representative said there was “no basis at all for any charges to be made against her, and there is absolutely no truth in any allegation that she received a plot of land in Dhaka through illegal means”.

The MP for Hampstead and Highgate has denied allegations of corruption linked to her aunt’s collapsed regime and accused the Bangladeshi authorities of a “targeted and baseless” campaign against her.

Siddiq resigned in January as economic secretary to the Treasury, citing the risk of becoming a distraction and saying the government was being harmed by the furore over her use of properties given to herself and her family by allies of the regime of Hasina.

She was not deemed by Keir Starmer’s ethics adviser to have broken any rules over her use of the homes and he found no evidence to suggest that any of Siddiq’s assets were derived from anything other than legitimate means.

But Laurie Magnus did find a lack of records and said lapse of time meant he had “not been able to obtain comprehensive comfort in relation to all the UK property-related matters”.

A Conservative party spokesperson said: “If it is the case that Keir Starmer’s choice for anti-corruption minister is the subject of an international arrest warrant for corruption, she should immediately stand down as Labour MP.

“It is shocking that Keir Starmer believes ‘the door remains open’ for Ms Siddiq returning to a government position. Keir Starmer must put his close friendship and association with Ms Siddiq aside and take the action he should have months ago.”

Bangladesh’s anti-corruption commission (ACC) has alleged that Siddiq, 42, received a 670 sq metre plot in the diplomatic zone of the capital, Dhaka, through ties to the former rulers, according to the Sunday Telegraph.

The allegation is that Siddiq persuaded her aunt to allocate three plots of land in the exclusive enclave for her family members, including her mother, Sheikh Rehana, her brother Radwan and her younger sister Azmina. The family are all based in Britain.

The ACC chair, Mohammad Abdul Momen, previously told the BBC the investigations in Bangladesh were “based on documentary evidence of corruption” and Siddiq should return to fight her case in Bangladesh.

In a statement made through her lawyers, Siddiq’s representatives said: “The ACC has made various allegations against Ms Siddiq through the media in the last few months. The allegations are completely false and have been dealt with in writing by Ms Siddiq’s lawyers.

“The ACC has not responded to Ms Siddiq or put any allegations to her directly or through her lawyers. Ms Siddiq knows nothing about a hearing in Dhaka relating to her and she has no knowledge of any arrest warrant that is said to have been issued.

“To be clear, there is no basis at all for any charges to be made against her, and there is absolutely no truth in any allegation that she received a plot of land in Dhaka through illegal means.

“She has never had a plot of land in Bangladesh and she has never influenced any allocation of plots of land to her family members or anyone else.

“No evidence has been provided by the ACC to support this or any other allegation made against Ms Siddiq and it is clear to us that the charges are politically motivated.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/13/tulip-siddiq-uk-mp-arrest-warrant-issued-bangladesh,1
Weather tracker: early heatwave sweeps northern India,"Northern India has been experiencing early extreme heat this week as temperatures topped 40C (104F), including in the capital, New Delhi.

Hot weather across the north-west of the country peaked on Tuesday as Barmer, a city in the state of Rajasthan, reached 46.4C – more than 6C above the average maximum in April.

New Delhi rose to 40.3C on Wednesday, surpassing 40C for the first time this year. Farther south, Jaipur exceeded 40C for five consecutive days from Sunday, with a maximum temperature of 43C recorded on Wednesday, almost 5C above the average April high.

The Indian meteorology bureau said last week that most parts of the country would experience an intense heatwave this summer, with two to four more such days than normal.

The extreme early heat this week triggered severe thunderstorms across Bihar, including in Patna. At least 19 people have died in the past two days amid frequent lightning, significant hail and strong winds.

There was extensive damage to crops – including wheat, mango and lychee – weeks before the harvest. Stormy conditions are likely to persist across Bihar until Saturday, owing to a low-pressure system over the west-central Bay of Bengal.

Meanwhile, parts of east Africa are experiencing higher-than-average temperatures, which could approach the April record.

In Mali, the national meteorological agency issued an extreme weather warning covering the entire country from Wednesday to Sunday. Maximum temperatures are expected to reach 40-47C for at least three consecutive days.

This is comparable to average temperatures during the height of summer in June and July, whereas April averages tend to be 38-40C. People have been advised to stay indoors during the hottest hours, wear light-coloured clothing, eat foods with high quantities of liquid and drink plenty of water.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/11/weather-tracker-early-heatwave-sweeps-northern-india,1
Elderly British couple ‘interrogated 29 times by Taliban’ since imprisonment,"An elderly British couple taken captive by the Taliban have been interrogated 29 times since they were imprisoned more than two months ago, and still have “absolutely no idea” why they have been incarcerated, their daughter has said.

No charges have been brought against Peter Reynolds, 79, and his wife, Barbie, 75, who ran school training programmes and were arrested alongside an American friend, Faye Hall, as they travelled to their home in Bamyan province, in central Afghanistan, in February.

Hall was released last weekend after the Trump administration lifted bounties worth $10m (£7.8m) from the heads of senior Taliban figures, including Sirajuddin Haqqani, the interior minister.

Their daughter, Susie Romer, told Channel 5 that hearing her parents cry on the phone was “excruciating” for her, and called on the UK government to do more to secure their release.

The daughter of Peter and Barbie Reynolds, a British couple currently being held by the Taliban, has told 5 News in an exclusive interview that she urges the UK government to do more to secure their release.



Susie Romer says her parents have lived in Afghanistan for over 18… pic.twitter.com/Rs3gn58rgQ — Channel 5 News (@5_News) April 10, 2025

Romer said that although the British government had been assisting the family, she would like the government to do more to make it clear to the Taliban that her parents “should be immediately released”, she said.

“It’s been 10 weeks now, and we’ve not been reassured that this message has been conveyed, but this is really urgent.

“Each day that they remain in prison, they’re at risk, so we’ll keep on asking the government to send that message.”

The couple have endured 29 interrogations so far, and have now been told “there is not actually a charge against them”, she said.

She described the conditions her parents were being held in as “absolutely horrific”. Mice and cockroaches are “running about” their cells and they receive just one meal a day.

In recordings shared with the Sunday Times last week, Peter Reynolds said: “I’ve been joined up with rapists and murderers by handcuffs and ankle cuffs, including a man who killed his wife and three children, shouting away, a demon-possessed man.”

He said he was living in “a cage rather than a cell”, but described his circumstances as “VIP conditions” compared with where his wife was being held.

During an interview with BBC News last week, the couple’s son, Jonathan Reynolds, said he had been “interacting” with the US government after a video plea to Donald Trump for help to have his parents released.

This week, the Taliban told the Associated Press the case “will soon be resolved” and “should not be a cause for concern”.

A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: “We are supporting the family of two British nationals who are detained in Afghanistan.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/10/peter-barbie-reynolds-british-couple-interrogated-taliban-since-imprisonment,1
US extradites Canadian citizen to India for alleged role in deadly Mumbai attacks,"A Pakistan-born Canadian citizen wanted for his alleged role in the deadly 2008 Mumbai siege has landed in New Delhi after his extradition from the United States.

Tahawwur Hussain Rana, 64, arrived at a military airbase outside the Indian capital under heavily armed guard late on Thursday, and will be held in detention to face trial.

India accuses Rana of being a member of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) group, designated by the United Nations as a terrorist organisation, and of helping to plot the attacks.

The National Investigation Agency said it “secured the successful extradition of … Mumbai terror attack mastermind Tahawwur Rana from the US”.

The extradition took “years of sustained and concerted efforts to bring the key conspirator behind the 2008 mayhem to justice”.

Donald Trump announced in February that Washington would extradite Rana, whom he called “one of the very evil people in the world”.

Rana was flown to India after the US supreme court this month rejected his bid to remain in the United States, where he was serving a sentence related to another LeT-linked attack.

New Delhi blamed the LeT group – as well as intelligence officials from New Delhi’s arch-enemy, Pakistan – for the 2008 Mumbai attacks wherein 10 Islamist gunmen carried out a multiday slaughter in the country’s financial capital, killing 166 people and injuring hundreds more.

India accuses Rana of helping his long-term friend, David Coleman Headley, who was sentenced by a US court in 2013 to 35 years in prison after pleading guilty to aiding LeT militants, including by scouting target locations in Mumbai.

Rana, who denies the charges, is accused of playing a smaller role than Headley, but India maintains he is one of the key plotters.

Rana “is accused of conspiring with David Coleman Headley, and operatives of designated [Pakistan-based] terrorist organisations LeT and Harkat-ul-Jihadi Islami … to carry out the devastating terror attacks,” the NIA said in the statement.

Rana, a former military medic who served in Pakistan’s army, emigrated to Canada in 1997, before moving to the United States and setting up businesses in Chicago, including a law firm and a slaughterhouse.

He was arrested by US police in 2009.

A US court in 2013 acquitted Rana of conspiracy to provide material support to the Mumbai attacks. But the same court convicted him of backing LeT to provide material support to a plot to commit murder in Denmark.

Rana was sentenced to 14 years for his involvement in a conspiracy to attack the offices of the Jyllands-Posten newspaper, which had published cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad.

In February, Devendra Fadnavis, chief minister of Maharashtra state, which includes the megacity Mumbai, said that “finally, the long wait is over and justice will be done”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/10/mumbai-attacks-tahawwur-hussain-rana,1
Apple said to be flying iPhones from India to US to avoid Trump tariffs,"Apple is reportedly chartering cargo flights to ferry iPhones from its Indian manufacturing plants to the US in an attempt to beat Donald Trump’s tariffs.

The tech company has flown 600 tonnes of iPhones, or as many as 1.5m handsets, to the US from India since March after ramping up production at its plants in the country, according to Reuters.

Trump’s threatened tariffs of 26% on Indian imports are on hold for about three months after the US president called a 90-day pause, but he has announced that tariffs on goods from China – where Apple assembles most of its iPhones – will be subject to a levy of at least 145%.

A source familiar with the planning behind the move told Reuters Apple “wanted to beat the tariff”. Imports to the US from India still face a tariff under Trump’s policy but at the reduced rate of 10%.

Analysts have warned iPhone prices could surge after the US imposed its highest tariff on imports from China, with the investment bank UBS estimating an iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB of storage could increase in price by more than two-thirds from $1,199 (£925) to nearly $2,000 if Apple passes on a substantial chunk of the tariff costs.

Reuters reported that Apple had targeted a 20% increase in production at iPhone plants in India. It did this by increasing the number of workers, and temporarily extending operations at the biggest Foxconn India factory in Chennai to Sundays.

The Chennai plant produced 20m iPhones last year, including the latest iPhone 15 and 16 models. Apple has three plants in India operated by Foxconn and Tata.

The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Apple planned to send more iPhones to the US from India as a “short-term stopgap” while the company attempted to secure an exemption from the China tariffs. If Apple diverted all India-made iPhones to the US it would account for about 50% of American demand this year, according to the Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan.

Analysts have warned that moving iPhone production to the US would be prohibitively expensive because of factors such as the cost of paying hundreds of thousands of workers. Analysts at Wedbush Securities, a US financial services company, have said a US-made iPhone would cost $3,500.

"Wealthiest English private schools spend below 6% on means-tested bursaries, research finds","England’s wealthiest private schools devote only a fraction of their income towards means-tested bursaries, according to research that undermines claims that adding VAT to school fees would decimate support for poorer pupils.

The Private Education Policy Forum (PEPF), a thinktank campaigning for greater equality and transparency among independent schools, gathered data from more than 200 leading schools and found they spent less than 6% of their total fee income on supporting pupils based on family income.

While independent schools argue that they support tens of thousands of pupils with assistance, the PEPF found that much of the support at the schools it examined was not means-tested, and included discounts for siblings attending the same school, fee rebates for children of staff, and sports or music scholarships.

As a result, the PEPF said, much of the fee remission given by those private schools may not go to genuinely disadvantaged children.

A spokesperson for the PEPF said: “This research shows that these private schools channel very little of their income into providing an education for those who cannot afford their fees, now £16,000 a year on average.

“Despite increases in fees above inflation, we can see from the report that some private schools have not hugely increased their spending on bursaries for poorer children. Half of reduced fees are not means-tested on family income at all, the research shows.

“This is not a good enough performance from a sector wishing to claim it is charitable and motivated by the public good, and which argues it should retain VAT tax relief despite the rest of the country having to considerably tighten its belt.”

The PEPF said many private schools did not publish details of their bursaries and scholarships, meaning that the larger schools it surveyed might not be representative of the sector. Its figures found that in 2022-23, the schools gave £224m worth of means-tested support, and £185m in unassessed support.

The Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents 60% of England’s 2,400 private schools, said its figures showed that £1bn in fee assistance by its members was divided between both forms of assistance. The £494m devoted to means-tested support in 2023 was 32% higher than in 2012 after adjusting for inflation.

An ISC spokesperson said: “This report takes an unrepresentative sample of independent schools and starts from a baseline of one of the most anomalous years schools have ever seen.

“There is a good conversation to be had – one we are keen to participate in – about bursaries and how independent schools could more effectively target them. Sadly, this research adds absolutely nothing to that conversation.”

After Labour announced it would add VAT to school fees, a string of private school leaders said they would be forced to cut back on financial assistance.

The PEPF’s research uncovered considerable variation in means-tested support between schools with similar fee incomes, some spending £500,000 and others up to £5m a year.

There was also variation in the number of full means-tested bursaries, with Manchester grammar school remitting the full fees of one in 10 pupils.

“Of course there are notable exceptions among some private schools but overall this charitable sector is not proving very impressive when it comes to genuinely helping ordinary and poorer families,” the PEPF said.",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/apr/15/wealthiest-private-schools-spend-less-than-6-on-means-tested-bursaries-thinktank-reports,1
"Reform a ‘racist and far-right’ party, says teaching union after Farage attack – as it happened","From 4h ago 15.57 CEST The largest education union in the country says Reform is as a 'racist and far-right' party The largest education union in the country, the National Education Union (NEU), has called Reform UK a “racist and far-right” political party. Reform – led by Nigel Farage - has been neck and neck with Labour and ahead of the Tories in some recent polls and will contest nearly all the 1,600 council seats up for re-election on 1 May. Delegates at the annual NEU conference called for the union’s political fund to be used to help campaign against Reform UK election candidates whose policies and campaigns were described as “racist”, according to the PA news agency. A motion, which was passed by delegates at the conference on Tuesday, said it believes Reform UK is racist because of its hardline policies on immigration and its “campaigns against migrants”. It added that organisations like Reform UK “seek to build on the despair, poverty and alienation in our society by scapegoating refugees, asylum seekers, Muslims, Jews and others who do not fit their beliefs”. Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the NEU, has described Nigel Farage as a “pound shop Trump”. Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian Speaking to the media at the union’s annual conference in Harrogate in North Yorkshire, Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the NEU, said: “I think there’s an awful lot of racists who are getting involved in Reform. I think Nigel Farage is a right-wing populist.” Speaking about Farage specifically, Kebede added: I’m surprised that our union seems to be living rent free in his head, to be honest. But this is just lifted directly from the Donald Trump playbook. Both Elon Musk and Donald Trump have been directly attacking the AFT and the NEA, the American teachers’ unions, and this is what Nigel Farage is. He’s a pound shop Donald Trump. When asked about the union’s stance on Reform UK at a press conference in County Durham on Tuesday afternoon, Farage accused the NEU leader of being a “self-declared Marxist” who he claimed was determined that “children should be poisoned at school” about everything to do with the country. Share Updated at 16.27 CEST

1h ago 19.00 CEST Closing summary The UK’s largest teaching union has called Reform UK “far-right and racist”, and its leader has dismissed Nigel Farage as “a poundshop Donald Trump,” as the union pledged funds to oppose the party’s candidates in elections. Delegates to the National Education Union’s annual conference backed a motion stating that “far-right and racist organisations, including Reform, seek to build on the despair, poverty and alienation in our society by scapegoating refugees, asylum seekers, Muslims, Jews and others who do not fit their beliefs”.

Nigel Farage has said Reform UK’s are “parking their tanks on the lawns of the ‘red wall’” in a speech ahead of May’s local elections in England. He claimed that Labour had become a middle-class party and abandoned the roots it was founded for, saying “our support is coming directly from people who have been, in many cases, lifelong Labour voters. “Reform are parking their tanks on the lawns of the ‘red wall’”, he said. “Today’s the first day I’ve said that but I absolutely mean it, and we’re here, and we’re here to stay. And the evidence is that people who are switching to us, this is not a short term protest. They actually believe in us.”

The business secretary has refused to rule out redundancies at the Scunthorpe steelworks, despite calls from trade unions to end the programme of job losses started by its former owners. Jonathan Reynolds said on Tuesday the plant might need to have a “different employment footprint” after the government’s takeover, even as he promised to try to save the plant’s two blast furnaces.

Foreign secretary David Lammy has said it is “morally wrong” to give up and turn away from the violence in Sudan, and committed the UK government to £120m worth of additional support. Opening a conference on the topic at the Foriegn Office in London, he said he personally had “refused to turn away”, saying it was wrong for people to “conclude that further conflict is effectively inevitable” because of “the country’s fraught history.”

Business and trade minister Sarah Jones has insisted that funds to rescue the British Steel plant in Scunthorpe has already been budgeted for, and is “within the existing fiscal envelope”. Speaking on Tuesday morning on Times Radio, the Labour MP for Croydon West said: “We have been really clear on steel that securing the future of the site in Scunthorpe is not just important for the 2,700 people who work there, but also because we know that demand for steel in the UK is growing. We know there’s a market there.”

Ed Davey has called on China to release the tapes of the interrogation of a Liberal Democrat MP who was denied entry to Hong Kong to visit her family. The party leader also urged foreign secretary David Lammy to summon the country’s ambassador to Britain to demand an explanation for Wera Hobhouse’s deportation, saying the UK should not be “kowtowing” to Beijing.

Ministers have announced an overhaul of the way carer’s allowance overpayments are checked in an attempt to fix the failing system which has left thousands with life-changing debts,fines and criminal records. In a significant policy change, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has been ordered to hire extra staff to investigate 100% of the carer’s allowance earnings breach alerts it receives and swiftly notify carers if they are at risk of falling into debt.

Keir Starmer’s Labour party faces a very difficult electoral test in the bellwether Scottish parliament seat of Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse in June, after Reform UK confirmed Nigel Farage will make a rare campaigning visit to Scotland. It emerged today a byelection will be held there on 5 June after the unexpected death last month of its widely respected MSP, Christina McKelvie, who had held the seat for the Scottish National party for 14 years. McKelvie, who had been fighting secondary breast cancer, had already announced she would stand down before the Holyrood elections next year. Share

Speakers in favour of the motion argued that some Reform UK candidates and activists “have been former members of fascist organisations or espoused their views” as justification. Daniel Kebede, the NEU’s general secretary, told journalists: “I’m sure Reform claim that they are not a racist organisation. However, they seem to be attracting an awful lot of former BNP activists, which would make me question that. “But fundamentally I have great concerns about what a Reform government would do to education.” Nigel Farage is a ‘poundshop Donald Trump’, says teaching union leader Read more Share

2h ago 18.01 CEST Ed Davey has called on China to release the tapes of the interrogation of a Liberal Democrat MP who was denied entry to Hong Kong to visit her family. The party leader also urged foreign secretary David Lammy to summon the country’s ambassador to Britain to demand an explanation for Wera Hobhouse’s deportation, saying the UK should not be “kowtowing” to Beijing. Hobhouse, the MP for Bath who is a member of the Inter-parliamentary Alliance on China (Ipac) which has been critical of Beijing’s human rights record, has said she believes the action was taken to silence her. She had flown to Hong Kong to see her son and newborn grandson but was held at the airport, questioned and sent back to the UK. Asked whether he agreed that she had been detained to “shut her up”, Davey told the PA news agency: “I think it’s very likely the case. “Liberal Democrats have stood up for the people of Hong Kong against oppression from Beijing, stood up for human rights, and I don’t think the Chinese government likes that. “And this may be a part of retaliation, even though Wera was only on a family visit, but I think that shows you that they behaved in a shocking way – they need to back down.” He added: “I very much hope the British Government, the foreign secretary, David Lammy, will call in the Chinese ambassador and demand an explanation. We shouldn’t be kowtow(ing), I’m afraid, to Beijing.” Share

3h ago 17.39 CEST Severin Carrell Keir Starmer’s Labour party faces a very difficult electoral test in the bellwether Scottish parliament seat of Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse in June, after Reform UK confirmed Nigel Farage will make a rare campaigning visit to Scotland. It emerged today a byelection will be held there on 5 June after the unexpected death last month of its widely respected MSP, Christina McKelvie, who had held the seat for the Scottish National party for 14 years. McKelvie, who had been fighting secondary breast cancer, had already announced she would stand down before the Holyrood elections next year. In normal circumstances this contest would be a straight head to head between the SNP and Scottish Labour, which had hoped to finally regain power at Holyrood after nearly 20 years in opposition. Labour trounced the SNP in a byelection for the adjacent Westminster seat of Rutherglen and Hamilton West in late 2023, but its popularity has plummeted since the general election. Although it has primarily cut into Scottish Conservative support in Scotland, Reform UK is also making inroads into Labour’s vote, adding to its difficulties. This byelection could become a classic protest vote against Starmer’s government: Scottish Labour’s support has slumped in parallel with the fall in Labour’s UK-wide popularity. The SNP, which has seen its support flatline under current leader John Swinney, will focus heavily on Labour’s decision not to compensate the Waspi pensioners; its continuing two child benefits cap and the cuts to winter fuel payments. A Reform UK spokesperson told the Herald it had already started canvassing: Nigel is definitely coming. The team will be up here … I’m sure if there is an opportunity for Nigel to campaign in Hamilton Nigel will be looking to do that. Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s deputy leader, said the byelection was “a chance to vote for a new direction with Scottish Labour. People in this community and right across Scotland are being let down by this tired and out-of-touch SNP government.” The SNP has already selected Katy Loudon, who lost to Labour in the Rutherglen byelection. She said: Households across the constituency are benefiting from SNP decisions – including free prescriptions and social care, free university tuition or help for older people with heating bills. In stark contrast, the UK Labour government is making life harder for ordinary people across Scotland. Share

3h ago 17.16 CEST Patrick Butler Ministers have announced an overhaul of the way carer’s allowance overpayments are checked in an attempt to fix the failing system which has left thousands with life-changing debts,fines and criminal records. In a significant policy change, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has been ordered to hire extra staff to investigate 100% of the carer’s allowance earnings breach alerts it receives and swiftly notify carers if they are at risk of falling into debt. Last year, the Guardian revealed that for the last six years, the DWP has chosen to investigate just 50% of alerts on cost grounds – even though this has led to huge numbers of carers unknowingly accruing massive overpayments. Campaigners are optimistic the move could, over time, significantly reduce the numbers of carers falling foul of the system – but warned thousands more will be unfairly hit by overpayments as huge backlogs of alerts are processed over the next few months. Carers in England and Wales who breach carer’s allowance earnings limits of £196 a week must return the full £83.30 a week benefit payment, a “cliff edge” penalty that means going £1 a week over the limit for one year would result in the claimant being hit with a repayment demand not of £52, but £4,330.

3h ago 16.55 CEST Ed Davey said Donald Trump was “acting like a bully” and the government should respond with “strength”. Speaking to the PA news agency from manufacturing business LJA Miers & Co in St Neots, the Liberal Democrats leader said: We [should] say to president Trump, if you’re not going to play fair, we’re going to keep trading with each other. We’re going to grow elsewhere, but also come together to oppose what president Trump is doing to the world economy at the moment. At the moment he’s picking us off, he’s dividing and ruling, he’s acting like a bully. The only way you respond to a bully is by strength and by people coming together to oppose that. Share

4h ago 16.24 CEST We briefly mentioned in an earlier post that the National Education Union (NEU) indicated that it would launch a formal ballot on strike action if the government’s final pay offer for teachers “remains unacceptable”. We now have some more details from their annual conference, held in Harrogate in North Yorkshire this year. A motion passed at the conference said the government’s recommended 2.8% pay rise for September was “inadequate and unfunded” and it would prevent the government achieving its target of recruiting 6,500 more teachers. In its evidence to the School Teachers’ Review Body (STRB) in December, the department for education (DfE) said a 2.8% pay rise for teachers in 2025/26 would be “appropriate” and would “maintain the competitiveness” of teachers’ pay despite the “challenging financial backdrop” the government is facing. The government has yet to publish the recommendations of the teachers’ pay review body, or its decision on whether to accept them. Education secretary Bridget Phillipson has said “any move towards industrial action by teaching unions would be indefensible”. An urgent motion, carried by conference delegates on Tuesday, called for a formal industrial action ballot to be launched if the final outcome of the STRB process “remains unacceptable” – or if the government does not announce real-terms funding increases in the spending review in June. NEU members staged eight days of strike action in state schools in England in 2023 in a long-running pay dispute. In July 2023, the government agreed to implement the STRB’s recommendation of a 6.5% increase for teachers in England, and co-ordinated strike action by four unions was called off. Teachers in England received a fully funded 5.5% pay rise in September last year. Share Updated at 16.25 CEST

4h ago 15.57 CEST The largest education union in the country says Reform is as a 'racist and far-right' party The largest education union in the country, the National Education Union (NEU), has called Reform UK a “racist and far-right” political party. Reform – led by Nigel Farage - has been neck and neck with Labour and ahead of the Tories in some recent polls and will contest nearly all the 1,600 council seats up for re-election on 1 May. Delegates at the annual NEU conference called for the union’s political fund to be used to help campaign against Reform UK election candidates whose policies and campaigns were described as “racist”, according to the PA news agency. A motion, which was passed by delegates at the conference on Tuesday, said it believes Reform UK is racist because of its hardline policies on immigration and its “campaigns against migrants”. It added that organisations like Reform UK “seek to build on the despair, poverty and alienation in our society by scapegoating refugees, asylum seekers, Muslims, Jews and others who do not fit their beliefs”. View image in fullscreen Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the NEU, has described Nigel Farage as a “pound shop Trump”. Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian Speaking to the media at the union’s annual conference in Harrogate in North Yorkshire, Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the NEU, said: “I think there’s an awful lot of racists who are getting involved in Reform. I think Nigel Farage is a right-wing populist.” Speaking about Farage specifically, Kebede added: I’m surprised that our union seems to be living rent free in his head, to be honest. But this is just lifted directly from the Donald Trump playbook. Both Elon Musk and Donald Trump have been directly attacking the AFT and the NEA, the American teachers’ unions, and this is what Nigel Farage is. He’s a pound shop Donald Trump. When asked about the union’s stance on Reform UK at a press conference in County Durham on Tuesday afternoon, Farage accused the NEU leader of being a “self-declared Marxist” who he claimed was determined that “children should be poisoned at school” about everything to do with the country.

5h ago 15.23 CEST Farage: Reform UK is 'parking their tanks on the lawns of the red wall' Nigel Farage has said Reform UK’s are “parking their tanks on the lawns of the ‘red wall’” in a speech ahead of May’s local elections in England. He claimed that Labour had become a middle-class party and abandoned the roots it was founded for, saying “our support is coming directly from people who have been, in many cases, lifelong Labour voters. “Reform are parking their tanks on the lawns of the ‘red wall’”, he said. “Today’s the first day I’ve said that but I absolutely mean it, and we’re here, and we’re here to stay. And the evidence is that people who are switching to us, this is not a short term protest. They actually believe in us.” Listing recent council byelection gains, the MP for Clacton, speaking in County Durham, claimed the party is giving Labour “one hell of a run for their money” and is now “the opposition to the Labour party, with the Conservatives trailing some way behind”. He attacked the Conservatives as a spent force and wasted vote in large areas of England, saying “The sheer level of betrayal of what people who voted for Boris Johnson in 2019 got, they didn’t get the Brexit they voted for, and they got mass immigration on a scale never seen before in the history of these islands, those people are not ever going to trust the Conservative party again.” In a lengthy speech covering regular Reform UK talking points, Farage claimed there had been a cover-up over the Southport stabbings, that it was a conspiracy theory to suggest he held favourable views of Vladimir Putin, and said Reform was against “DEI and that madness”. At one point during the speech, made on the anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, Farage posed with a front page of today’s the Sun newspaper which declared Britain was broken. The Reform UK leader wrote an op-ed for the paper today. Farage appeared to try to claim credit for the government’s rescue of British Steel, telling supporters at the event “I don’t believe there would have been a Saturday sitting in parliament if Richard Tice and I had not been up to Scunthorpe and been greeted the way we were by those workers, especially in the local ‘Spoons afterwards, they actually felt there was someone speaking up for them.” Farage said it was Reform’s policy to “re-industrialise” Britain, and claimed that investments in oil and gas would provide tens of thousands of well paid jobs. He accused Ed Miliband of wanting to “despoil” the British coastline with windfarms, and suggested that the removal of inheritance tax perks from farms was partly because Miliband wanted to replace agricultural land with “Chinese slave-labour made solar farms.” Farage also angrily attacked Daniel Kebede, president of the National Education Union (NEU) as someone he said was “poisoning the minds of our kids”, and said that if Reform won the next general election it would “go to war with the National Education union and all the left wing teaching unions.” View image in fullscreen Nigel Farage at Newton Aycliffe working mens club in Durham. Photograph: Victoria Jones/REX/Shutterstock The Reform UK leader ended his speech by saying it was the party’s “historic mission” to change Britain’s culture. He said “It’s about understanding that Britain is broken, and that without the right leadership, without the right change of mentality, and I think most of us feel, within a decade, it frankly, won’t be a place worth living in.

Liz Truss to launch ‘uncensored’ social network to counter mainstream media,"Liz Truss is preparing to launch her own social media platform championing free speech, as she warned the “deep state” and mainstream media were stifling freedom of expression in Britain.

The former prime minister said the platform would launch this summer. It is her latest attempt to become a leading figure on the radical right in Britain, openly declaring her support for Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s mission to slash state spending in the US.

Truss made the revelation at a cryptocurrency conference in Bedford over the weekend. She said that she had been “cut off at the knees” when she became prime minister by “the elite”, which opposed radical change.

“That has made me think that it’s not enough just to get into number 10,” she said. “What I’m now thinking is we need a media network to be able to communicate to people, to be able to have a grassroots movement that is actually really demanding change of our leaders.”

She said she was worried about how issues were “suppressed or promoted” by the mainstream media, appearing to compare Britain to communist Russia. “This is the kind of thing that we used to see going on in the Soviet Union and it’s now happening to us and it is absolutely shocking that that is the case in modern Britain,” she said.

“I do think this needs to be actively fought and what I am doing is establishing a new free speech network, which will be uncensored and uncancellable, to actually talk about the issues people don’t want to talk about.”

Her attempt to create her own social media platform follows in the footsteps of Trump’s Truth Social, operated by the Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG). Investing in TMTG became a means by which individual investors showed their support for the US president. TMTG lost $400.9m (£303.5m) last year.

The track record of UK political figures attempting to start their own social networks is not encouraging. The former health secretary Matt Hancock closed his Matt Hancock app in 2023, having launched it five years earlier to “promote a healthy, open and impartial debate”.

UK government refuses to rule out redundancies at Scunthorpe steelworks,"The business secretary has refused to rule out redundancies at the Scunthorpe steelworks, despite calls from trade unions to end the programme of job losses started by its former owners.

Jonathan Reynolds said on Tuesday the plant might need to have a “different employment footprint” after the government’s takeover, even as he promised to try to save the plant’s two blast furnaces.

Reynolds was speaking during a visit to Immingham docks to oversee coal and iron ore being unloaded on its way to the Scunthorpe plant. The government took control of the plant after finding out its Chinese owner, Jingye, was attempting to sell the supplies and hasten the closure of the furnaces.

“What we need for the long-term future of British Steel is that private sector partner to work with us as a government on a transformation programme,” Reynolds said.

“That might be new technology, new facilities, that might have a different employment footprint. The staff here absolutely know that, they know they need a long-term future.”

He added: “These blast furnaces have given this country nearly a century of service in one case, so they know they need the future, and that might be a different model, different technology. What they didn’t want was the unplanned, uncontrolled shutdown of the blast furnaces with thousands of job losses and no plan in place for the future.

“And by what we’ve been able to do, working with the brilliant team here at British Steel, is secure the possibility of that better future – and I for one am confident that we’ve made the right decision to support the people here.”

Reynolds made his comments even as the GMB union called for an end to the formal redundancy programme, which British Steel began last year. Those plans could have meant the closure of both blast furnaces and more than half of the site’s 3,500 workers losing their jobs.

Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, national officer at GMB, said: “We are expecting the immediate threat of redundancies to be taken off the table, and we are looking to work with the secretary of state on planning the longer-term future for Scunthorpe and the steel making there.”

Reynolds has the task both of securing immediate supplies to keep the furnaces running and looking for a longer-term bidder for the Scunthorpe site. Ministers want to find a private sector company to help the government pay for a new electric furnace at the plant, which forms the central part of British Steel’s £1.25bn decarbonisation plan.

Reynolds said over the weekend he would not “bring a Chinese company into our steel sector” again, but on Tuesday he appeared to change his mind and refused to rule out the possibility that a Chinese company could take over the site once more.

“I think you would look at a Chinese firm in a different way but I’m really keen to stress the action we’ve taken here was to step in, because it was one specific company that I thought wasn’t acting in the UK’s national interest, and we had to take the action we did,” he said.

Reynolds’ change of tone comes amid a broader push by the UK government to limit the political fallout from the crisis surrounding British Steel.

Over the weekend, the business secretary refused to rule out the possibility that Jingye’s actions might have been part of a deliberate act of sabotage to undermine the British steel industry. But by Monday, officials and ministers were insisting that was not the case, saying they believed the company had been acting purely out of commercial considerations.

The government’s push to secure Chinese investment in British infrastructure has begun to alarm some senior figures within Labour.

Liam Byrne, the chair of the business select committee, told the Guardian this week: “We must now be fiercely vigilant about just who is granted the keys to the industries and infrastructure that keep our nation moving.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/15/uk-government-refuses-to-rule-out-redundancies-at-scunthorpe-steelworks,1
"Civil case against influencer Andrew Tate is first of its kind, UK judge told","A civil case against Andrew Tate over allegations he subjected four women to sexual violence and coercive control is the first case of its kind, a judge has been told.

The influencer is being sued by two women who worked for his webcam business in Luton, Bedfordshire, in 2015 and two former girlfriends in 2013 and 2014.

One woman has accused Tate, 38, of raping, strangling and whipping her with a belt in 2015. She has also alleged he pointed a gun in her face and said: “I’m a boss, I’m a fucking G, you’re going to do as I say or there’ll be hell to pay.”

Anne Studd KC, representing the women, told the judge, Richard Armstrong, it was thought to be the “first occasion” that coercive control was “brought before the high court in a civil context”.

In written submissions, the barrister added the case was “understood to be the first claim where allegations of coercive control have been considered in a civil context of whether that behaviour can amount to intentional infliction of harm”.

The hearing at the high court in London on Tuesday dealt with preliminary matters, including disclosure and legal costs. The judge said the claimants were “seeking damages likely to reach six figures” and scheduled a three-week trial for early 2027.

Tate denies the allegations and claims his relationships with the women were consensual. Studd told the court there was “a total denial of wrongdoing” and that Tate had dismissed the claims in his written defence as “a pack of lies” and “nonsense”. Tate’s lawyers further claim the allegations for personal injury are barred as they are subject to a three-year limitation period.

Studd said there was a “vast amount” to review in the case, including “thousands of pages of open-source material” produced by Tate, “as well as material provided from law enforcement agencies, material from criminal proceedings in other jurisdictions” and video footage.

She told the court: “[Tate] has a profile, largely made by himself, where he regularly discusses issues of violence against women and girls and misogyny” and gave his “seemingly high-profile support for behaviours of that type”.

The judge allowed the women to rely on evidence from one expert on “why victims of sexual violence do not always bring claims precipitously”, but refused to allow them to rely on a second expert on coercive control.

Studd had said expert evidence was needed so the court had “the whole picture”, describing coercive control as “a form of grooming and manipulation where the victim becomes less and less able to respond in what might be perceived as a normal way. In particular, she may not leave even if the door is open.”

But Vanessa Marshall KC, for Tate, said the additional expert evidence was “unnecessary”.

Armstrong did not allow Tate’s lawyers to claim the costs of travelling to Romania to take statements. “He has travelled to the US and Dubai recently, there is no reason he cannot travel to the UK,” the judge said.

Three of the women had reported Tate to Hertfordshire police in 2019 but the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to bring criminal charges.

Tate and his brother Tristan are under criminal investigation in Romania over allegations of human trafficking, trafficking of minors and money laundering.

Bedfordshire police are seeking to arrest the Tate brothers in relation to allegations of rape and trafficking dating to between 2012 and 2015. The two men deny all accusations against them.",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/apr/15/civil-case-against-influencer-andrew-tate-is-first-of-its-kind-uk-judge-told,1
UK weather: heavy rain warning issued for western England and Wales,"A month’s worth of rain is expected to fall on parts of the UK within 48 hours as the good weather the country has basked in for weeks comes to a soggy end.

Western England and the whole of Wales have been warned of possible flooding as the Easter weekend approaches.

The Met Office issued a yellow warning for rain beginning at noon on Tuesday and lasting for 24 hours, advising that there could be transport disruption, flooding of homes and businesses and a chance of power cuts.

Spray and flooding on roads could make journey times longer and there may be delays on bus and train services, forecasters said.

Areas within the zone include popular holiday spots in Cornwall and Devon as well as Bristol, Bath, Herefordshire, Shropshire, parts of Cheshire and Merseyside.

The Met Office said: “Whilst there is some uncertainty in where the heaviest rain will fall, 20-40mm of rain is expected fairly widely. A few places may see 50-75 mm of rain during this period.”

By Tuesday evening 36mm (1.4in) had fallen in Culdrose in Cornwall in 24 hours and 30mm in Milford Haven in south-west Wales. The east of England did not completely escape, with 21mm falling on parts of Suffolk.

By the end of Wednesday as much as 75mm was expected to have fallen in some areas of west Wales over 48 hours – about the same as the average for the whole of April.

Wind was also expected to be an issue on Wednesday, with very strong gusts hitting parts of the south coast of England and 50mph flurries inland.

A yellow warning was in place for Northern Ireland for much of Wednesday, where up to 60mm of rain was predicted over the high ground of Antrim and Down.

After weeks of fine weather for many parts of the UK, the Met Office said low pressure was leading to unsettled conditions.

Its chief meteorologist, Matthew Lehnert, said: “After a long spell of high pressure bringing dry weather and sunshine, gloomier and unsettled conditions are on the horizon. Low pressure has become established to the west of the UK, bringing cloud, rain showers and lower temperatures for many.

“More persistent and heavy rain is expected on Tuesday into early Wednesday. A low-pressure system near Portugal is of particular interest as it moves towards the UK, bringing with it potentially heavy rain and thunderstorms.

“High rainfall totals are possible but, given the recent dry conditions, significant impacts are not anticipated. The situation remains under close watch, with further wet conditions anticipated on Thursday and another weather front moving in on Friday.”

In England, the Environment Agency had nine flood alerts – meaning flooding is possible – in place on Tuesday afternoon. There were no flood warnings for Wales.

The Environment Agency was monitoring the River Mimram, a chalk stream in Hertfordshire, where the persistent rain in December and January has led to high groundwater levels. It said there may be risk of flooding there to very low-lying properties.

Storm Hans, named by the Italian Met Service, is due to bring strong winds and rough seas to parts of the Mediterranean this week.

Heavy rain is a concern, particularly in northern Italy, where over 200mm (8in) may fall by Thursday, giving a risk of flash flooding and landslides.

Temperatures in the UK are likely to be around average for the time of year, with potentially unsettled days, dry interludes and chilly nights.

The AA issued an amber warning for traffic for the Easter weekend. It said more than 19m journeys were expected on Good Friday and more than 18m on Easter Monday.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/15/uk-weather-heavy-rain-warning-western-england-wales,1
Celebrities criticize all-female rocket launch: ‘This is beyond parody’,"The all-female Blue Origin rocket launch may have received plenty of glowing media coverage – but not everyone is impressed.

The stunt has drawn criticism from a number of female celebrities who were not keen on the Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin NS-31 mission, which included Katy Perry, Bezos’s fiancee Lauren Sanchez, aerospace engineer Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, film producer Kerianne Flynn and, in a twist straight out of Apple TV’s The Morning Show, CBS Mornings host Gayle King.

Model and actor Emily Ratajkowski said she was “disgusted” by the 11-minute space flight, which featured Perry serenading her fellow passengers with a cover of What a Wonderful World and advertising her upcoming tour setlist in brief zero gravity. “That’s end time shit,” Ratajkowski said. “Like, this is beyond parody.”

“You say that you care about Mother Earth, and it’s about Mother Earth, and you’re going up in a spaceship that is built and paid for by a company that’s single-handedly destroying the planet,” she added. “Look at the state of the world and think about how many resources went into putting these women into space. For what?”

The launch from west Texas on Monday, paid for by the Amazon founder’s private space company, met with widespread derision online and countless memes – such as photos of Perry holding up a daisy in tribute to her daughter Daisy Dove Bloom and kissing the ground on her return to Earth, captioned “getting off a commercial flight in 2025 #BlueOrigin”, in reference to a spate of airline incidents this year. Actor and director Olivia Wilde reshared the meme on her Instagram stories with the added caption “Billion dollars bought some good memes I guess”.

Amy Schumer also mocked the flight on Instagram, posting a sarcastic video in which she announced that she got a last-minute invitation to join the mission. “Guys, last second they added me to space and I’m going to space,” the comedian joked while holding up a Black Panther toy. “I’m bringing this thing. It has no meaning to me, but it was in my bag and I was on the subway, and I got the text and they were like, ‘Do you want to go to space?’ so I’m going to space.”

“Thank you to everyone who got me here and I’ll see you guys in space,” she added with the caption “space”.

In another video posted to her stories, Schumer continued to mock the hype around the flight: “So I’m going to space and I’m so excited. Lauren Sanchez, Katy Perry and Amanda Nguyen have been my guiding lights through this whole journey, which I just got called to be part of this space team this morning. And I’m loving it. I’ve always wanted to go to space, and also I just have to say, How high were the people who came up with the name for space? Were they like, ‘What should we call it? It’s got so much, like, space.’”

Earlier this month, actor Olivia Munn made waves when she questioned the flight’s objective. “I know this probably isn’t the cool thing to say, but there are so many other things that are so important in the world right now,” she said during an appearance on Today With Jenna and Friends on 3 April. “What are you guys gonna do up in space? What are you doing up there?

“I know this is probably obnoxious,” she continued, “but like, it’s so much money to go to space, and there’s a lot of people who can’t even afford eggs.”

Munn also called the flight “a bit gluttonous”, because “space exploration was to further our knowledge and to help mankind. What are they gonna do up there that has made it better for us down here?”

Some of the flight’s participants have defended the launch. Asked by People about overall criticism to the mission during a post-flight press conference, King said that in her eyes, “anybody that’s criticizing it doesn’t really understand what is happening here”.

“We can all speak to the response we’re getting from young women from young girls about what this represents,” the longtime broadcast journalist added. Sanchez then added that the derision got her “really fired up”.

“I would love to have them come to Blue Origin and see the thousands of employees that don’t just work here but they put their heart and soul into this vehicle. They love their work and they love the mission and it’s a big deal for them,” she continued. “So when we hear comments like that, I just say, ‘Trust me. Come with me. I’ll show you what this is about, and it’s, it’s really eye-opening.’”

27m ago 20.55 CEST Trump exempts dozens of coal plants from mercury and air toxics limits The Trump administration has exempted 47 companies from regulations to curb mercury and air toxics for their coal-fired power plants for two years, according to a list of facilities published by the Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday. Reuters reports that the exemptions list is the latest move by the administration to use executive or emergency orders to immediately shield polluting facilities from compliance with air and water standards tightened by the Biden administration as the EPA undertakes a lengthier process to roll back those rules. The Biden-era Mercury and Air Toxics Standard is still in force after the supreme Ccurt in October declined to put the rules on hold after a group of mostly Republican states and industry groups led a legal challenge to suspend it. But Donald Trump issued a proclamation last week detailing that certain stationary sources subject to MATS are exempt from compliance in a bid to revive the coal industry and prolong the life of aging coal power plants. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin the American Lung Association says could cause severe developmental harm. Mercury and other air toxics associated with coal burning raise the risk of asthma attacks, strokes, heart attacks and lung cancer. The Biden-era rule required constant monitoring of emissions.

29m ago 20.52 CEST Judge to consider Trump administration's compliance with order over wrongly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia Later today, US district judge Paula Xinis will consider her next steps on what she called the Trump administration’s failure to update her on efforts to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who it illegally deported to El Salvador, in an extraordinary case critics say shows the administration may choose to defy unfavorable court orders. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was deported on 15 March despite an order protecting him from removal to El Salvador, is one of several that have sparked concerns that Donald Trump’s administration is willing to disregard the judiciary. The hearing in Greenbelt, Maryland, is due to begin at 4pm ET. Asked about the case earlier, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration was complying with all court orders. “We’re very confident that every action taken by this administration is within the confines of the law,” she said. Legal experts said Xinis at the hearing may ask the administration whether it told El Salvador president Nayib Bukele - who met Trump at the White House on Monday - not to release Abrego Garcia, which could amount to defiance of the court’s order to “facilitate” his return. During the meeting with Bukele on Monday, secretary of state Marco Rubio said: “The foreign policy of the United States is conducted by the president of the United States, not by a court.” Trump called reporters asking whether the administration would seek the return of Abrego Garcia “sick people.” Meanwhile, Bukele told reporters at the White House he did not have the power to return Abrego Garcia to the US. “The question is preposterous. How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States?” Bukele said, echoing the Trump administration’s claim that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, which Washington labels a terrorist organization. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers have denied he is a gang member, saying the US has presented no credible evidence to support the claim. US senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland said in a statement on Monday that if Abrego Garcia was not home by “midweek,” he would travel to El Salvador to discuss his release. “Since the Trump administration appears to be ignoring these court mandates, we need to take additional action,” Van Hollen said.

2h ago 18.58 CEST Lauren Gambino Voters in Oakland will elect a new mayor today in a race that many residents view as a battle between a hometown hero and Big Tech money. Barbara Lee, who represented Oakland in Congress for a quarter-century and is known internationally for her lonely stand against the use of military force in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, faces a strong challenge from former city councilman Loren Taylor. While Lee has won the backing of local leaders – including nearly every member of the city council, former mayors of the city and labor unions, her opponent is drawing outside support from a coalition of independent groups backed by wealthy tech executives that have worked to elect more moderate Democrats in blue cities across the Bay Area. The effort has had success helping to elect tech-friendly mayors in San Francisco and San Jose and funding successful recall efforts against progressive leaders, including the former Oakland mayor Sheng Thao. Thao was recently indicted on federal bribery charges; she denies wrongdoing. “The tech bros, the oligarchy, crypto bros, all of that stuff that we’re starting to see here – it came from San Francisco politics,” said Pamela Drake, a longtime activist and progressive political commentator who is supporting Lee. Drake said she feared a “tech takeover” of the city’s politics. “That is what we see as a real threat,” she said, “that it is no longer going to be Oaklanders deciding what we want done.” She pointed to a pro-Taylor committee that received tens of thousands of dollars from Max Hodak, who co-founded Neuralink with Elon Musk, who is leading the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle large swaths of the federal workforce. Hodak split with Musk several years ago. In an interview, Taylor, who narrowly lost the 2022 mayor’s race to Thao, called the claim that his campaign was driven by outside money “inaccurate” and emphasized his fundraising strength among grassroots Oakland-based donors.

3h ago 18.47 CEST ‘Shock to the system’: farmers hit by Trump’s tariffs and cuts say they need another bailout Nina Lakhani Farmers across the US say they could face financial ruin – unless there is a huge taxpayer-funded bail out to compensate for losses generated by Donald Trump’s sweeping cuts and chaotic tariffs. Rural counties rallied behind Trump last year, averaging 78% support in farming-dependent counties, but anxiety is mounting among the agricultural base. The climate crisis-fueled extreme weather is compounded by the US president’s looming trade war and the administration targeting popular federal programs and staff, leaving farmers reeling and resigned to needing another bailout. Travis Johnson, who lost more than 1,000 acres of cotton, sorghum and corn after a year’s rain fell within 48 hours in the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) in southern Texas last month, turning parched fields into lakes, said: There’s a lot of uncertainty around and I hate to be used as a bargaining chip. I am definitely worried. RGV farmers sell sorghum, wheat, corn and vegetables to Mexico among other crops, while buying fertilizer and equipment – and relying on Mexican farmhands for cheap labor. Johnson added: We’ve already had two years of absolute disaster with falling prices and weather patterns … no farmer wants this but without a bailout this could be devastating and a lot more people could go under. The Trump administration has issued widespread cuts to oversubscribed and chronically underfunded federal climate and conservation schemes designed to reduce costs and greenhouse gases, and improve yields and environmental health. Trump is also shuttering local food programs which provide farmers with stable domestic markets like public school districts and food banks, helping make farms more resilient to global economic shocks. The USAID, which purchased about $2bn every year in agricultural products particularly wheat, sorghum and lentils for humanitarian aid programs, has been dismantled. The loss in federal programs alone would have been tough to cope with, but then came the trade chaos. Trump’s tariff announcements began when most farmers already had spring crops in the ground – or at the very least had prepared the land and purchased inputs such as seeds and pesticides, making it impossible to switch to crops that could potentially find a market domestically. Consensus is growing among experts that the turmoil represents an opportunity for rival agriculture economies – and disaster for US farmers. Ben Murray, senior researcher with the consumer advocacy group Food and Water Watch, said: Without a bailout, we can only imagine how bad this will be for farmers and what an opportunity for Brazil – and this is all being done for a tax cut for the wealthy. ‘Shock to the system’: farmers hit by Trump’s tariffs and cuts say they need another bailout Read more Share Updated at 18.47 CEST",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/apr/15/donald-trump-harvard-funding-tariffs-immigration-dei-us-politics-live-updates,1
Obama backs Harvard as Yale faculty members support standing up to Trump,"Barack Obama has come out in support of Harvard after the Trump administration elected to cut $2bn of its federal grants after the Ivy League school in Massachusetts rejected what it said was an attempt at “government regulation” of the university.

Meanwhile, faculty at Yale University – another prominent Ivy League institution – has asked its leadership “to resist and legally challenge any unlawful demands that threaten academic freedom and … self-governance”.

A statement from Obama, the US president from 2009 to 2017, says: “Harvard has set an example for other higher-ed institutions – rejecting an unlawful and ham-handed attempt to stifle academic freedom, while taking concrete steps to make sure all students at Harvard can benefit from an environment of intellectual inquiry, rigorous debate and mutual respect.

“Let’s hope other institutions follow suit.”

The standoff between some of the US’s most prestigious universities and the federal government deepened overnight on Monday after Harvard rejected elevated demands by Donald Trump’s administration, which the president has called an effort to curb antisemitism on campus. Many educators, however, see the demands as a thinly veiled effort to more broadly curb academic freedoms.

“No government – regardless of which party is in power – should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,” Harvard’s president, Alan Garber, said.

The Trump administration, through the multi-federal agency joint task force to combat anti-semitism, responded by freezing $2.2bn in multi-year grants and $60m in multi-year contract value to Harvard.

On Tuesday, Trump himself published a post on his Truth Social platform saying “perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity”.

The intervention by Obama came after 876 faculty members at Yale published a letter to their leadership expressing support for standing up to the Trump administration.

“We stand together at a crossroads,” the letter read. “American universities are facing extraordinary attacks that threaten the bedrock principles of a democratic society, including rights of free expression, association, and academic freedom. We write as one faculty, to ask you to stand with us now.”

Though the letter does not say Harvard specifically, it also asks Yale’s leadership to “work purposefully and proactively with other colleges and universities in collective defense”.

Columbia University in New York, the site of pro-Palestinian protests in 2024, has agreed to partly comply with a series of demands from the Trump administration about how it will handle such demonstrations, academic departments and antisemitism after it received warnings it would lose federal funding, but also defended academic freedoms.

Princeton in New Jersey has said it has not received a specific list of demands from the government. The university’s president, Christopher Eisgruber, said in an email to the community earlier in April that while the rationale for the administration’s threat to withhold funding was not yet clear, the university “will comply with the law”.

“We are committed to fighting antisemitism and all forms of discrimination, and we will cooperate with the government in combating antisemitism,” Eisgruber added. “Princeton will also vigorously defend academic freedom and the due process rights of this university.”

“The Trump administration is using the threat of funding cuts as a tactic to force universities to yield to government control over research, teaching, and speech on private campuses. It is flagrantly unlawful,” said a statement from Rachel Goodman, counsel of the American Association of University Professors.

Columbia agreed to a ban on face masks for the purposes of concealing one’s identity, to bar protests inside academic buildings and to review how Middle East studies programs are administered. It also acquiesced to expanding “intellectual diversity”, including by appointing new faculty members to its Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies department.

The stated goal of the Trump administration’s antisemitism taskforce is to “root out antisemitic harassment in schools and on college campuses”. But many believe that is a cover for a range of conservative goals, including eliminating racial quotas in admissions – and resetting what the administration sees as a far-left bias in academia.

“We are going to choke off the money to schools that aid the Marxist assault on our American heritage and on western civilization itself,” Trump said in 2023. “The days of subsidizing communist indoctrination in our colleges will soon be over.”

On Tuesday, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said Trump “wants to see Harvard apologize” for what she called “the egregious antisemitism that took place on their college campus”.

“When it comes to Harvard … the president has been quite clear: they must follow federal law,” Leavitt said.

In March, the taskforce leader, Leo Terrell, a former Fox News commentator, said: “We’re going to bankrupt these universities” if they do not “play ball”.

The administration, in total, has frozen or canceled more than $11bn in funding from at least seven universities as part of its effort to end what it calls “ideological capture”. At least 300 students, recent graduates and postdoctoral students have had their visas and legal immigration statuses revoked as part of the crackdown.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology president, Sally Kornbluth, said on Monday that nine MIT students had seen their visas revoked over the previous week – revocations that she said would have a chilling effect on “top talent” worldwide and would “damage American competitiveness and scientific leadership for years to come”.

But Trump’s education secretary, Linda McMahon, told the Wall Street Journal that it was within the federal government’s power to ask universities to make changes to campus policies.

“If you’re taking federal funds, then we want to make sure that you’re abiding by federal law,” McMahon said, though she rejected that the administration was attempting to curb academic freedom and the right to peacefully protest or disagree.

A White House spokesperson, Kush Desai, told the outlet that the taskforce “is motivated by one thing and one thing only: tackling antisemitism”.

Desai said: “Antisemitic protesters inflicting violence and taking over entire college campus buildings is not only a crude display of bigotry against Jewish Americans, but entirely disruptive to the intellectual inquiry and research that federal funding of colleges is meant to support.”",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/apr/15/obama-yale-harvard-trump-cuts,1
Attorney general dodges question on Trump proposal to jail US citizens in El Salvador,"The US attorney general declined on Tuesday to say whether Donald Trump’s suggestion of removing US citizens to El Salvador was legal, in alarming remarks about what experts think is an obviously illegal idea.

Trump proposed the idea on Monday in the Oval Office during a visit with El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, who has been accepting people deported from the US and imprisoning them in a gigantic facility notorious for human rights abuses.

The US president said “homegrown criminals that push people into subways, that hit elderly ladies on the back of the head with a baseball bat when they’re not looking” could be sent to El Salvador and imprisoned.

Asked by the Fox News host Jesse Watters if the idea was legal, Bondi demurred.

“These are Americans who he is saying have committed the most heinous crimes in our country, and crime is going to decrease dramatically because he has given us a directive to make America safe again,” she said.

“These people need to be locked up as long as they can, as long as the law allows. We’re not going to let them go anywhere, and if we have to build more prisons in our country, we will do it.”

Trump has previously said he “loved” the idea of deporting US citizens to El Salvador. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, has said Trump “simply floated” the idea.

During a White House briefing on Tuesday, Leavitt was asked whether it was legal to deport US citizens to Central American prisons. “It’s a legal question that the president is looking into,” she said, adding that Trump was only considering the action for those Americans “who are the most violent, egregious repeat offenders of crime”.

Lawyers and other experts say the idea is clearly illegal.

“There is no provision under US law that would allow the government to kick citizens out of the country,” the University of Notre Dame professor Erin Corcoran, an immigration law expert, told Reuters.

“It is pretty obviously illegal and unconstitutional,” said Ilya Somin, a professor at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School, told NBC News.

How Harvard’s pushback against Trump may embolden more US resistance,"It might come to be seen as the moment the “woke liberal empire” of Donald Trump’s most fevered imaginings struck back.

Harvard University, the world-renowned institution emblematic of the elitism that Trump and his coterie hold in contempt, received an extortive demand from the administration that it surrender the core of its academic freedoms – and promptly told it to get lost.

That, in shorthand, is a summary of the exchange of letters between three Trump officials and Harvard’s president, Alan Garber, that may in time be seen as something of a turning point in relations between the administration and academia.

Echoing pressures imposed on other elite colleges, notably Columbia University, the Trump team – representing the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services, and the General Services Administration – had demanded sweeping reforms in how Harvard is run, including the installation of viewpoint-diverse faculty members and the end of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes.

The backdrop to a demand for what would be unprecedented government interference in the affairs of the world’s richest university is the alleged rise of campus antisemitism, arising from an upsurge of pro-Palestinian demonstrations that have gripped Harvard and other colleges following Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel and Israel’s retaliatory military offensive in Gaza.

Critics, however, see a more nefarious White House agenda – namely, gutting universities of what it sees as a liberal-left bias, while using antisemitism as a cudgel in an authoritarian power grab.

Having seen Columbia cave in to similar demands and threatening $9bn in federal funding, the White House may have thought it was on to a winner with Harvard.

“Investment is not an entitlement,” the administration’s 11 April letter read, accusing Harvard of having “failed to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment”.

The missive then set out a detailed list of 10 conditions that Harvard needed to satisfy in order to received continued funding.

Bolstered by a financial endowment that reached $53.2m in 2024 and which might cushion the blow of federal cuts, Garber called the White House’s bluff.

He did so in terms clearly expressing his belief that the government’s stated goals of stamping out antisemitism – an issue Harvard had already taken steps to address, including, controversially, by adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of the prejudice – masked more insidious aims.

The administration’s demands made “clear that the intention is not to work with us to address antisemitism in a cooperative and constructive manner”, Garber wrote.

“Although some of the demands outlined by the government are aimed at combating antisemitism, the majority represent direct governmental regulation of the ‘intellectual conditions’ at Harvard.

“No government – regardless of which party is in power – should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.”

The university’s lawyers, Michael Burck and Robert Hur, both of whom have conservative credentials, starkly set out the broader constitutional stakes, writing that the government’s demands were “in contravention of the first amendment” and concluding that “Harvard is not prepared to agree to demands that go beyond the lawful authority of this or any administration”.

Within hours of Harvard’s rebuff, the administration retaliated by freezing $2.2bn in grants along with a $60m contract.

It seemed somehow fitting that Harvard’s stand was being made on the same day that the Trump administration was openly defying a supreme court ruling to return a wrongfully deported Salvadorian man, Kilmar Abrego García, and El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, was visiting the White House.

That posture appeared to put the onus on the supreme court to take a more forceful stand against the White House’s defiance.

Now, thanks to Harvard’s stance, some establishment figures hope the court may just find the spine to do so.

Michael Luttig, a conservative-leaning former federal appeals court judge who has previously accused the administration of “declaring war on the rule of law”, said Harvard’s pushback had “momentous significance”.

“This should be the turning point in the president’s rampage against American institutions,” he told the New York Times.

Other universities, faced with similar demands to capitulate, now have a stronger impetus to fight back, said Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, although most others lack Harvard’s financial reserves. “If Harvard had not taken this stand, it would have been nearly impossible for other institutions to do so,” he said.

It may also provide inspiration for law firms – several of whom have already agreed to demands that they provide pro bono services to Trump as he seeks retribution against those who have represented his adversaries – to stand firm in the face of future intimidation.

Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff and head of policy, is said to have wanted a fight with Harvard, believing it essential to break a liberal hold on higher education.

But if the university’s response serves as an example to others, the battle may turn into a wider front than he envisioned.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/15/harvard-pushback-trump-administration,1
US labor groups sue over ‘ignorant’ cuts of programs fighting child labor abroad,"Labor groups have filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s abrupt termination of international labor rights programs aimed at ending child labor and other abuses.

The Solidarity Center, Global March Against Child Labour, and the American Institutes for Research (AIR), filed the lawsuit on Tuesday seeking to stop the cuts, enacted by Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), and arguing the programs were authorized by Congress and that the secretary of labor has no authority to cancel the funds.

Several groups supporting workers and corporations have criticized the Trump administration’s decision to abruptly cancel all ongoing grants and contracts for programs with the Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) at the Department of Labor which works to improve labor conditions outside the US.

In March Doge announced it had canceled about $577m in grants for programs it labeled “America last”. Doge cited programs including “worker empowerment in South America”, “improving respect for Worker’s rights in agricultural supply chains” in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador and “assisting foreign migrant workers” in Malaysia.

The AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the US, and the American Apparel & Footwear Association (AAFA), whose members include corporations such as Adidas and Ralph Lauren, criticized the cuts and argued the decision “puts American workers and American businesses last” by enabling the degradation of labor and business standards abroad.

“It’s just so frustrating to read the shallow and useless justifications that are being put out on Twitter by the secretary of labor and the Doge crowd,” said Thea Lee, who served as deputy undersecretary for international labor affairs at the US Department of Labor from 2021 to 2025. “The abrupt termination of all of ILAB grants is a destruction of decades of consensus that is bipartisan, that is business and labor agreeing together that these are important things. It’s ignorant. It’s self-defeating, and it’s wasteful and inefficient.”

Lee explained the cuts demonstrate ignorance of how the global economy works, of the long-term sourcing and investment decisions made by corporations, and the negative impacts on American workers, businesses and consumers in competing and relying on supply chains where forced labor, child labor and other human rights abuses are ignored.

“This was a completely indiscriminate meat ax that was taken to these projects and workers will suffer, businesses will suffer and American workers will suffer,” said Lee.

Lee cited programs and research required to enforce trade agreements between the US and other nations, such as the National Child Labor survey, and around enforcing the bipartisan Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which was co-sponsored by the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, when he was a senator as examples of programs where the work already completed is likely to be wasted due to the cuts.

Shawna Bader-Blau, the executive director of the Solidarity Center, a non-profit working in more than 90 countries to improve worker standards and conditions, said the cuts reduced the organization’s budget by 20%, in addition to 30% cuts through USAID cuts.

“It’s a devastating, huge impact. The Solidarity Center is very often in countries where they are the only external support for trade union organizing and the advancement of worker rights. If we have to leave, we’re not replaced,” said Bader-Blau. “It’s critical to the American economy that American workers not be forced to compete with extremely exploited workers in other countries, up to and including forced and child labor in supply chains.”

She cited programs involved in enforcing labor aspects of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), signed under Trump’s first term, to improve labor conditions in Mexico. The programs directly affect US workers whose jobs have often been outsourced to Mexico by corporations to exploit cheaper labor.

The cuts, noted Bader-Blau, made it more likely that workers will be affected by offshoring and consumers will be purchasing goods where labor abuses are rampant in the supply chain.

The cuts follow cancellations of previous grants, including a program that began in 2022 and was slated to continue until 2026 to provide support for Uzbekistan, the sixth largest producer of cotton in the world, after the country banned forced labor and child labor in its cotton production industry.

The program was created to affirm and support the ban on forced labor and child labor so American corporations that had boycotted cotton from the region could begin sourcing from the country.

The program’s cancellation was touted by the US labor secretary, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, last month.

“State-imposed forced labor was used in the cotton harvest for decades,” said Raluca Dumitrescu, coordinator for the Cotton Campaign.

Umida Niyazova, director of the Uzbek Forum for Human Rights, explained Uzbekistan had moved in recent years from producing cotton and exporting the entire crop, to developing a textile industry to process it. Though the country has eliminated forced labor and child labor in harvesting, problems and abuses are still rampant throughout the industry.

“Since 2021, under enormous pressure, the state has changed the coercive practice of mass mobilization for cotton harvesting, however, the risks of forced labor remain high since structural reforms have not been implemented,” said Niyazova.

Niyazova said the country still needed programs to establish decent labor standards and enforce them, such as the cancelled ILAB program.

“As Uzbek textile products are aimed at the foreign market, this concerns other countries and people of goodwill who would not want to become potential participants in a production chain based on worker exploitation,” she added.

A spokesperson for the US Department of Labor did not provide information on how the funds will be reallocated, and did not comment on criticisms of the cuts.

“The American people resoundingly elected President Trump with a clear mandate to reduce federal government bloat and root out waste. Americans don’t want their hard-earned tax dollars bankrolling foreign handouts that put America last,” said Courtney Parella, US Department of Labor spokesperson, in an email. “That’s why we’re focused on improving oversight and accountability within this program – and across the entire department – while prioritizing investments in the American workforce.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/15/musk-doge-child-labor-cuts,1

Donald Trump will take America through yet another grave and unprecedented national drama this week when he becomes the first ex-president to appear in court charged with a crime.

The 45th president is expected to turn himself in on Tuesday in Manhattan, the stage where he built his legend as a brash popular culture figure and real estate magnate but which could now, in the case of “The People of the State of New York against Donald J. Trump,” engineer his downfall.

In what will be extraordinary scenes, Trump will return to New York after a grand jury voted to indict him last week in a case involving a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. His appearance, accompanied by Secret Service agents, will come as he fires up his 2024 campaign for the White House. Trump plans to make a make a speech when he gets back to Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday night in which he will seek to leverage political advantage out of a perilous, personal legal crisis.

For many Americans who disdain Trump and his riotous single term, the case could be a sign that, finally, he is being called to account for his rule-crushing behavior and that everyone – even former presidents – are equal under the law. But Trump, using his bond with his most loyal supporters, is claiming the prosecution is a case of naked political persecution from District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, that’s designed to thwart the possibility of a presidential comeback. According to fundraising numbers that his campaign is touting, Trump is getting a political boost from the attention.

Yet a criminal indictment takes Trump into unique political territory. And however the case turns out, his return to the spotlight in these circumstances is another twist in an exhausting saga featuring a double impeachment, false claims of a stolen election, and a mob attack on the US Congress during an unruly four-year presidency that pushed the nation to the point of exhaustion and deepened its polarization.

Some legal experts, without having seen the still-sealed indictment, have questioned whether a case that appears to revolve around infringements of accounting practices and possible campaign finance violations is sufficiently serious to merit the historical step of indicting an ex-president who is already running again.

At the same time, it is ultimately Trump’s norm-busting behavior that pushed the country to this somber moment. He’s also being investigated over efforts to overturn the 2020 election result in Georgia, and by a special counsel probing his hoarding of classified documents and conduct in the run up to January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. In several of these cases, Trump could face even more serious legal problems than in the Stormy Daniels matter, but that case is the only one so far that has yielded an indictment.

Trump has denied wrongdoing in all of the cases. But once more, America’s political and legal systems, under a near-constant stress test since he came down the escalator in Trump Tower to launch his campaign in 2015, will be put under enormous pressure that is likely to only deepen the country’s internal estrangement.",https://edition.cnn.com/webview/politics/live-news/trump-indictment-stormy-daniels-news-04-03-23/index.html,1

"April 3, 2023 - Russia-Ukraine news","A Ukrainian tank is seen near the frontline area amid the Russia-Ukraine war, in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on April 02. (Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)

The Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.

The General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.

It said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.

“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.

West of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.

Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”

“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.

Syrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”

Some of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.

“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.

He also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.

“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.

He also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”

Social media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.

Denis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.

“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said.",https://edition.cnn.com/webview/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-04-03-23/index.html,1

Chinese spy balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing,"Washington CNN —

The Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.

The balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.

Still, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.

A US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”

The US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.

As CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.

The FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.

CNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.

The balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.

A senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”

Gen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”

The surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.

Roughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.

China has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.

Still, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.

Beijing promised to ‘fight back’ over Taiwan leader Tsai’s US visit. But this time it has more to lose,"Hong Kong CNN —

An anticipated meeting between Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen and US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California this week has sparked concerns of a repeat of the pressure campaign China launched last year when then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei.

At that time, Beijing encircled the island democracy with unprecedented military drills – firing multiple missiles into its surrounding waters and sending dozens of warplanes speeding across a sensitive median line dividing the Taiwan Strait.

It also cut off contact with the United States over a number of issues from military matters to combating climate change, in retaliation for what it viewed as a violation of its sovereignty.

This time, Beijing has already threatened to “resolutely fight back” if a Tsai-McCarthy meeting goes ahead.

It also slammed Washington for allowing Tsai to stopover in the US while en route to and from official visits in Central America, warning it could lead to “serious” confrontation between the two powers.

A defiant Tsai staked out her own ground, pledging as she took off on her 10-day trip not to let “external pressure” stop Taiwan from connecting with the world and like-minded democracies.

But the optics of the meeting, taking place in California and not Taiwan, and its timing – at a particularly thorny moment in China’s foreign relations and ahead of a presidential election in Taiwan that could reset the tone of its relationship with Beijing – may see Beijing tread more carefully this time, or at least not escalate further, analysts say.

“This puts the burden on China not to overreact, because any overreaction is only going to push China further away from the world,” said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington.

That doesn’t mean, however, that Beijing won’t be closely watching Tsai’s movements as it calibrates its response – and decides how much military might to flex over her meeting with an American lawmaker on American soil.

The opacity of China’s system – and the potential for competing interests within its vast bureaucracy – also make it difficult to accurately predict its response.

“Every time Taiwan does anything that China doesn’t like, the Chinese react with their own military coercion,” Sun said. But in the current situation, “they have to consider the consequences of overreaction,” she added.

Rising pressure

The expected meeting, which McCarthy’s office announced earlier this week would take place on Wednesday, also comes at a precarious moment in US-China relations.

Washington and Beijing are struggling to stabilize their communication amid flaring tensions over issues from a downed suspected Chinese surveillance balloon to semiconductor supply chains – raising the stakes of potential damage to that relationship if Beijing lashes out as it did when Tsai met Pelosi.

Taiwan is still feeling the fallout of that response last August, with Chinese military forces now regularly making incursions over what had previously been an informal but largely respected border of control between Beijing and Taipei in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan’s official Central News Agency also reported Monday that Tsai would meet with McCarthy, citing Tsai’s presidential office.

But a meeting between Tsai and the leader of the Republican majority in the US House of Representatives, who ranks second in line to the Presidency, would mark another symbolic moment for Taiwan and the US, which only maintain unofficial ties.

For Tsai, who is entering the final year of her two-term presidency, “it’s clearly a capstone event,” according to Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University’s Taiwan Studies Program. “She has this image as the Taiwanese president who has taken US-Taiwan relations to new heights, and who … has been able to give Taiwan almost unprecedented international visibility,” he said.

That increased visibility – and enhanced cooperation with the US – has followed China’s mounting pressure on the island, which sits fewer than 110 miles (177 kilometers) from the mainland coast.

China’s Communist Party claims the self-governing island democracy as its own despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary.

The party has undertaken a sweeping expansion of its military capabilities over the past decade under leader Xi Jinping – and ramped up its pervasive economic, diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan.

That’s driven concerns, among some in Washington, that Beijing is preparing for an invasion, though China’s official language still suggests that scenario is not its preferred option for achieving the claimed goal of “reunification.”

It is those pressures – and how to support Taiwan against unilateral actions by Beijing – that are likely to be on the table when Tsai, McCarthy and a bipartisan group of US lawmakers sit down on Wednesday.

Congress has been a pillar of increasing American support for Taiwan in recent years. Lawmakers regularly visit the island and drive bipartisan legislation enhancing support and cooperation.

While the US switched its diplomatic relations to Beijing decades ago, it maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and is bound by law to provide the democratic island with the means to defend itself.

Under Washington’s longstanding “One China” policy, the US acknowledges China’s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never officially recognized Beijing’s claim to the island of 23 million.

Though McCarthy does not have Pelosi’s decades-long record of advocacy regarding China, the California Republican is now a leading voice pushing for closer scrutiny of Beijing, and meeting Tsai could help him to burnish that image.

Last month, McCarthy told reporters that meeting Tsai in the US would not impact whether he travels to Taiwan in the future – something he had earlier said he wanted to do.

Beijing watching

A meeting in California, on US soil, is widely seen as less likely to provoke Beijing than a McCarthy visit to Taiwan.

Pelosi’s trip – the first from a lawmaker of that rank to the island in 25 years – generated a fever pitch of nationalist and anti-US rhetoric in mainland China.

This time, so far, domestic conversation in China’s heavily controlled media sphere has been significantly muted.

But the stakes remain high – including for Beijing itself – over how it responds, analysts say.

As Taiwan prepares for a presidential election in January, a fierce response could push voters away from Taiwan’s main opposition party Kuomintang (KMT), widely seen as more friendly toward Beijing.

It could also jar with another high profile trip happening now: a tour of mainland China from former Taiwan president and senior KMT member Ma Ying-jeou, the first visit from a current or former Taiwan leader since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949.

Ma’s tour is a “once in a half a century opportunity to send a conciliatory message between the two sides, Beijing shouldn’t want to tank that,” said Sung, the political scientist.

China is also acutely aware that its actions toward Taiwan are under a significantly brighter global spotlight following the invasion of Ukraine by Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close diplomatic partner of Xi. Putin’s rhetoric over Ukraine has echoes of how Xi speaks of Taiwan.

Beijing has recently sought to position itself as an agent of peace in that conflict – especially as it aims to repair frayed ties with Europe.

This week, as Tsai is expected to meet with McCarthy, French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will head to China – an important opportunity that Xi may not want to overshadow with military posturing.

An aggressive response also risks stoking confrontation with the US, not yet six months after Xi and US President Joe Biden called to enhance communication during a face-to-face meeting in Bali.

“(A less overtly aggressive response) would imply that Beijing does not wish to escalate tension with the US to a level that can risk getting out of hand,” said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.

“A reset in US-China ties is not on the agenda, but an easing of tension is not beyond the realm of possibility.”",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/04/asia/tsai-ing-wen-taiwan-mccarthy-meeting-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html,1

Artemis II: The 4 astronauts NASA picked for moon mission,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

Astronauts who will helm the first crewed moon mission in five decades were revealed on Monday, queuing up the quartet to begin training for the historic Artemis II lunar flyby that is set to take off in November 2024.

The astronauts are NASA’s Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch, and Jeremy Hansen of the Canadian Space Agency.

Wiseman is a 47-year-old decorated naval aviator and test pilot who was first selected to be a NASA astronaut in 2009. A native of Baltimore, Maryland, he’s completed one prior spaceflight, a 165-day trip to the International Space Station that had launched aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket in 2014. Most recently, Wiseman served as chief of the astronaut office before stepping down in November 2022, making him eligible for a flight assignment.

Wiseman will serve as commander of the Artemis II mission.

Hansen, 47, is a fighter pilot who was selected by the Canadian Space Agency for astronaut training in 2009. From London, Ontario, Hansen is one of only four active Canadian astronauts, and he recently became the first Canadian to be put in charge of training for a new class of NASA astronauts.

He will be the first Canadian ever to travel to deep space.

Glover is a 46-year-old naval aviator who returned to Earth from his first spaceflight in 2021 after piloting the second crewed flight of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft and spending nearly six months aboard the International Space Station.

“It’s so much more than the four names that have been announced,” Glover said during the Monday announcement at NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston. “We need to celebrate this moment in human history. … It is the next step in the journey that will get humanity to Mars.”

Glover, born in Pomona, California, served in several military squadrons in the United States and Japan in the 2000s, and he completed test pilot training with the US Air Force. When he was selected for the NASA astronaut corps in 2013, he was working in the US Senate as a legislative fellow. All told, Glover logged 3,000 flight hours in more than 40 aircraft, over 400 carrier arrested landings and 24 combat missions.

Glover’s first mission to space was as part of the SpaceX Crew-1 team, which launched to the International Space Station in November 2020 for a six-month stay on the orbiting laboratory.

Koch, 44, is a veteran of six spacewalks — including the first all-female spacewalk in 2019. She holds the record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman, with a total of 328 days in space. Koch is also an an electrical engineer who helped develop scientific instruments for multiple NASA mission. Koch, a native of Grand Rapids, Michigan, also spent a year at the South Pole, an arduous stay that could well prepare her for the intensity of a moon mission.

About this mission

The Artemis II mission will build on Artemis I, an uncrewed test mission that sent NASA’s Orion capsule on a 1.4 million-mile voyage to lap the moon that concluded in December. The space agency deemed that mission a success and is still working to review all the data collected.

If all goes to plan, Artemis II will take off around November 2024. The crew members, strapped inside the Orion spacecraft, will launch atop a NASA-developed Space Launch System rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

The journey is expected to last about 10 days and will send the crew out beyond the moon, potentially further than any human has traveled in history, though the exact distance is yet to be determined.

The “exact distance beyond the Moon will depend on the day of liftoff and the relative distance of the Moon from the Earth at the time of the mission,” NASA spokesperson Kathryn Hambleton said via email.

After circling the moon, the spacecraft will return to Earth for a splashdown landing in the Pacific Ocean.

Artemis II is expected to pave the way for the Artemis III mission later this decade, which NASA has vowed will put the first woman and person of color on the lunar surface. It will also mark the first time humans have touched down on the moon since the Apollo program ended in 1972.

The Artemis III mission is expected to take off later this decade. But much of the technology the mission will require, including spacesuits for walking on the moon and a lunar lander to ferry the astronauts to the moon’s surface, is still in development.

NASA is targeting a 2025 launch date for Artemis III, though the space agency’s inspector general has already said delays will likely push the mission to 2026 or later.

The space agency has been seeking to return people to the moon for more than a decade. The Artemis program was designed to pave the way to establishing a permanent lunar outpost, allowing astronauts to live and work deeper into space long term as NASA and its partners map a path to sending the first humans to Mars.

Picking the astronauts

Vanessa Wyche, the director of NASA’s Johnson Space Center, declined to provide details to CNN about the selection process. But she emphasized the diversity of the Artemis II crew, which includes men and women rather than only a staff of White male test pilots as has been the case for historic missions of the past.

“I can tell you, they still all have the right stuff,” Wyche said. “We have requirements different than we did (when we) just had test pilots” on inaugural missions.

Koch said in an interview with CNN’s Ed Lavandera that the group found out they were selected a few weeks ago.

“We were all sent to a meeting that was on our calendars under a different pretext that didn’t sound as lofty as the one it was going to be,” Koch said. “And accidentally two of us were very late to that meeting.”

She said the offer rendered her “speechless.”

“It truly is an honor,” she added. “It’s an honor — not to get myself in the space — but because it’s amazing to be a part of this team that’s going back to the moon and on to Mars.”

Marlene Schiappa: French minister under fire for appearing on front cover of Playboy magazine,"CNN —

French government minister Marlene Schiappa has come under fire from members of her own party after appearing on the front cover of Playboy magazine.

Schiappa, who has been a government minister since 2017, appeared on the cover of the magazine to accompany a 12-page interview she did on women’s and LGBT rights. Schiappa, who is the current Minister for the Social Economy and French Associations, was photographed for the cover wearing a white dress.

Schiappa has been a long-time advocate for women’s rights and was appointed as the country’s first ever Gender Equality Minister in 2017. In this role, she successfully spearheaded a new sexual harassment law which allows for on the spot fines to be issued to men who catcall, harass or follow women on the street.

Her appearance has drawn criticism from political colleagues including French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne.

Borne pulled up Schiappa over the cover, telling her it “wasn’t appropriate, especially during this period,” CNN affiliate BFMTV reported Saturday, citing a source close to the prime minister.

France is currently in the throes of a political and social crisis triggered by French President Emmanuel Macron’s move to push ahead with controversial pension reforms despite widespread public opposition.

“We are in the middle of a social crisis, there is the issue of policing, there are people between life and death, and I have the impression of being behind a smoke screen,” Sandrine Rousseau, Green Party politician and fellow women’s rights activist, told BFMTV Friday.

French politician, Jean Luc Mélenchon who came third in the 2022 presidential elections criticized both Schiappa’s appearance and the decision by French President Emmanuel Macron to give an interview to children’s magazine, Pif Gadget, this week.

“In a country where the President expresses himself in Pif and his minister in Playboy, the problem would be the opposition. France is going off the rails,” Mélenchon tweeted Saturday.

Schiappa responded to her critics in a tweet on Saturday, saying: “Defending the right of women to have control of their bodies, that’s everywhere and all the time. In France, women are free. With all due respect to the detractors and hypocrites.”

French Interior Minister, Gérald Darmanin came to Schiappa’s defense during an interview with French news channel CNews on Sunday calling her a “woman of character.”

“I wanted to say that Marlene Schiappa is a courageous female politician who has her character and who has her style which is not mine, but I respect,” he remarked.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/02/europe/french-minister-playboy-cover-intl/index.html,1

Britain’s pound is beating every other major currency this year,"London CNN —

The British pound crashed to a record low last fall as investors rebelled against budget plans by former Prime Minister Liz Truss. Now, it’s enjoying a comeback.

Sterling hit its highest level against the US dollar in 10 months on Tuesday, topping $1.25 for the first time since June 2022. The pound, which has advanced about 3.3% versus the greenback since the start of 2023, is the best-performing currency among developed economies this year.

The UK currency has been boosted by indications the country’s economy is holding up better than expected. Activity is now thought to have expanded 0.1% in the final three months of last year, up from a previous estimate of no growth at all. Gross domestic product growth in January has been estimated at 0.3% after dropping 0.5% in December.

This resilience is bolstering expectations the Bank of England will maintain aggressive interest rate hikes despite concerns about the health of the global banking sector. Rising rates can boost the domestic currency because they help attract foreign investors searching for higher returns.

Inflation in the United Kingdom also jumped to an annual rate of 10.4% in February, underscoring the need for the Bank of England to maintain its tough approach.

The pound turnaround

The pound plunged close to $1.03 in September 2022 after the Truss government unveiled plans to boost borrowing while slashing taxes, unleashing panic in financial markets that fueled fears of a recession in the United Kingdom.

The International Monetary Fund predicted in January that the UK economy would contract by 0.6% this year, while all other advanced economies would grow, if only slightly.

“There was a lot of pessimism being priced into the pound,” said Francesco Pesole, a currency strategist at ING.

But the sharp pullback in energy prices and China’s reopening have provided some relief about the economic outlook since the start of the year.

“There was a big re-rating of growth expectations around Europe, and that impacted the UK,” Pesole said.

The euro has also been lifted by these dynamics, rising 2.3% against the US dollar in 2023. The pound’s rally has been sharper in large part because its 2022 declines were more severe, according to Pesole.

Both currencies have been aided by the greenback’s sharp drop from highs reached last September as recession fears have percolated in the United States.

A lack of clarity around the Federal Reserve’s next steps has also restrained the dollar in recent weeks. Investor speculation has increased that the Fed could pause or stop rate hikes due to concerns about the economy following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank last month.

Jordan Rochester, a currency strategist at Nomura, said he thinks the pound could rise to $1.30 this year and “potentially higher.” But he still sees risks given the uncertainty surrounding the Bank of England’s plans and how rate rises will feed back through the country’s economy. And Pesole cautioned that currency fluctuations are often overdone when markets are choppy, as they are now.

“In a volatile market environment, moves are exacerbated,” he said.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/04/investing/british-pound-currency-dollar/index.html,1
Sanna Marin: Finland’s Prime Minister concedes election,"CNN —

Finland’s left-wing Prime Minister Sanna Marin conceded defeat on Sunday in the Nordic country’s parliamentary election as the opposition right-wing National Coalition Party (NCP) claimed victory in a tightly fought contest.

The pro-business NCP was expected to win 48 of the 200 seats in parliament, narrowly ahead of the nationalist Finns Party with 46 seats and Marin’s Social Democrats on 43 seats, justice ministry election data showed with all ballots counted.

“We got the biggest mandate,” NCP leader Petteri Orpo said in a speech to followers, vowing to “fix Finland” and its economy.

He will get the first chance at forming a coalition to obtain majority in parliament as Marin’s era as prime minister was expected to end.

“We have gained support, we have gained more seats (in parliament). That’s an excellent achievement, even if we did not finish first today,” the prime minister said in a speech to party members.

Marin, 37, the world’s youngest prime minister when she took office in 2019, is considered by fans around the globe as a millennial role model for progressive new leaders, but at home she has faced criticism for her partying and her government’s public spending.

While she remains very popular among many Finns, particularly young moderates, she antagonized some conservatives with lavish spending on pensions and education they see as not frugal enough.

The NCP has led in polls for almost two years although its lead had melted away in recent months. It has promised to curb spending and stop the rise of public debt, which has reached just over 70% of GDP since Marin took office in 2019.

Orpo accused Marin of eroding Finland’s economic resilience at a time when Europe’s energy crisis, driven by Russia’s war in Ukraine, has hit the country hard and the cost of living has increased.

Orpo has said he will negotiate with all groups to obtain a majority in parliament, while Marin has said her Social Democrats may govern with the NCP but will not go into government with the Finns Party.

Marin called the Finns Party “openly racist” during a debate in January – an accusation the nationalist group rejected.

The Finns Party’s main goal is to reduce what leader Riikka Purra has called “harmful” immigration from developing countries outside the European Union. It also calls for austerity policies to curb deficit spending, a stance it shares with the NCP.

"Pinduoduo: One of China’s most popular apps has the ability to spy on its users, say experts","CNN —

It is one of China’s most popular shopping apps, selling clothing, groceries and just about everything else under the sun to more than 750 million users a month.

But according to cybersecurity researchers, it can also bypass users’ cell phone security to monitor activities on other apps, check notifications, read private messages and change settings.

And once installed, it’s tough to remove.

While many apps collect vast troves of user data, sometimes without explicit consent, experts say e-commerce giant Pinduoduo has taken violations of privacy and data security to the next level.

In a detailed investigation, CNN spoke to half a dozen cybersecurity teams from Asia, Europe and the United States — as well as multiple former and current Pinduoduo employees — after receiving a tipoff.

Multiple experts identified the presence of malware on the Pinduoduo app that exploited vulnerabilities in Android operating systems. Company insiders said the exploits were utilized to spy on users and competitors, allegedly to boost sales.

“We haven’t seen a mainstream app like this trying to escalate their privileges to gain access to things that they’re not supposed to gain access to,” said Mikko Hyppönen, chief research officer at WithSecure, a Finnish cybersecurity firm.

“This is highly unusual, and it is pretty damning for Pinduoduo.”

Malware, short for malicious software, refers to any software developed to steal data or interfere with computer systems and mobile devices.

Evidence of sophisticated malware in the Pinduoduo app comes amid intense scrutiny of Chinese-developed apps like TikTok over concerns about data security.

Some American lawmakers are pushing for a national ban on the popular short-video app, whose CEO Shou Chew was grilled by Congress for five hours last week about its relations with the Chinese government.

The revelations are also likely to draw more attention to Pinduoduo’s international sister app, Temu, which is topping US download charts and fast expanding in other Western markets. Both are owned by Nasdaq-listed PDD, a multinational company with roots in China.

While Temu has not been implicated, Pinduoduo’s alleged actions risk casting a shadow over its sister app’s global expansion.

There is no evidence that Pinduoduo has handed data to the Chinese government. But as Beijing enjoys significant leverage over businesses under its jurisdiction, there are concerns from US lawmakers that any company operating in China could be forced to cooperate with a broad range of security activities.

The findings follow Google’s suspension of Pinduoduo from its Play Store in March, citing malware identified in versions of the app.

An ensuing report from Bloomberg said a Russian cybersecurity firm had also identified potential malware in the app.

Pinduoduo has previously rejected “the speculation and accusation that Pinduoduo app is malicious.”

CNN has contacted PDD multiple times over email and phone for comment, but has not received a response.

Rise to success

Pinduoduo, which boasts a user base that accounts for three quarters of China’s online population and a market value three times that of eBay (EBAY), wasn’t always an online shopping behemoth.

Founded in 2015 in Shanghai by Colin Huang, a former Google employee, the startup was fighting to establish itself in a market long dominated by e-commerce stalwarts Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD).

It succeeded by offering steep discounts on friends-and-family group buying orders and focusing on lower-income rural areas.

Pinduoduo posted triple digit growth in monthly users until the end of 2018, the year it listed in New York. By the middle of 2020, though, the increase in monthly users had slowed to around 50% and would continue to decline, according to its earnings reports.

It was in 2020, according to a current Pinduoduo employee, that the company set up a team of about 100 engineers and product managers to dig for vulnerabilities in Android phones, develop ways to exploit them — and turn that into profit.

According to the source, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisals, the company only targeted users in rural areas and smaller towns initially, while avoiding users in megacities such as Beijing and Shanghai.

“The goal was to reduce the risk of being exposed,” they said.

By collecting expansive data on user activities, the company was able to create a comprehensive portrait of users’ habits, interests and preferences, according to the source.

This allowed it to improve its machine learning model to offer more personalized push notifications and ads, attracting users to open the app and place orders, they said.

The team was disbanded in early March, the source added, after questions about their activities came to light.

PDD didn’t reply to CNN’s repeated requests for comment on the team.

What experts found

Approached by CNN, researchers from Tel Aviv-based cyber firm Check Point Research, Delaware-based app security startup Oversecured and Hyppönen’s WithSecure conducted independent analysis of the 6.49.0 version of the app, released on Chinese app stores in late February.

Google Play is not available in China, and Android users in the country download their apps from local stores. In March, when Google suspended Pinduoduo, it said it had found malware in off-Play versions of the app.

The researchers found code designed to achieve “privilege escalation”: a type of cyberattack that exploits a vulnerable operating system to gain a higher level of access to data than it’s supposed to have, according to experts.

“Our team has reverse engineered that code and we can confirm that it tries to escalate rights, tries to gain access to things normal apps wouldn’t be able to do on Android phones,” said Hyppönen.

The app was able to continue running in the background and prevent itself from being uninstalled, which allowed it to boost its monthly active user rates, Hyppönen said. It also had the ability to spy on competitors by tracking activity on other shopping apps and getting information from them, he added.

Check Point Research additionally identified ways in which the app was able to evade scrutiny.

The app deployed a method that allowed it to push updates without an app store review process meant to detect malicious applications, the researchers said.

They also identified in some plug-ins the intent to obscure potentially malicious components by hiding them under legitimate file names, such as Google’s.

“Such a technique is widely used by malware developers that inject malicious code into applications that have legitimate functionality,” they said.

Android targeted

In China, about three quarters of smartphone users are on the Android system. Apple (AAPL)’s iPhone has 25% market share, according to Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities.

Sergey Toshin, the founder of Oversecured, said Pinduoduo’s malware specifically targeted different Android-based operating systems, including those used by Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo.

CNN has reached out to these companies for comment.

Toshin described Pinduoduo as “the most dangerous malware” ever found among mainstream apps.

“I’ve never seen anything like this before. It’s like, super expansive,” he said.

Most phone manufacturers globally customize the core Android software, the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), to add unique features and applications to their own devices.

Toshin found Pinduoduo to have exploited about 50 Android system vulnerabilities. Most of the exploits were tailor made for customized parts known as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) code, which tends to be audited less often than AOSP and is therefore more prone to vulnerabilities, he said.

Pinduoduo also exploited a number of AOSP vulnerabilities, including one which was flagged by Toshin to Google in February 2022. Google fixed the bug this March, he said.

I’ve never seen anything like this before. It’s like, super expansive. Sergey Toshin, Android security expert

According to Toshin, the exploits allowed Pinduoduo access to users’ locations, contacts, calendars, notifications and photo albums without their consent. They were also able to change system settings and access users’ social network accounts and chats, he said.

Of the six teams CNN spoke to for this story, three did not conduct full examinations. But their primary reviews showed that Pinduoduo asked for a large number of permissions beyond the normal functions of a shopping app.

They included “potentially invasive permissions” such as “set wallpaper” and “download without notification,” said René Mayrhofer, head of the Institute of Networks and Security at the Johannes Kepler University Linz in Austria.

Disbanding the team

Suspicions about malware in Pinduoduo’s app were first raised in late February in a report by a Chinese cybersecurity firm called Dark Navy. Even though the analysis didn’t directly name the shopping giant, the report spread quickly among other researchers, who did name the company. Some of the analysts followed up with their own reports confirming the original findings.

Soon after, on March 5, Pinduoduo issued a new update of its app, version 6.50.0, which removed the exploits, according to two experts who CNN spoke to.

Two days after the update, Pinduoduo disbanded the team of engineers and product managers who had developed the exploits, according to the Pinduoduo source.

The next day, team members found themselves locked out of Pinduoduo’s bespoke workplace communication app, Knock, and lost access to files on the company’s internal network. Engineers also found their access to big data, data sheets and the log system revoked, the source said.

Most of the team were transferred to work at Temu. They were assigned to different departments at the subsidiary, with some working on marketing or developing push notifications, according to the source.

A core group of about 20 cybersecurity engineers who specialize in finding and exploiting vulnerabilities remain at Pinduoduo, they said.

Toshin of Oversecured, who looked into the update, said although the exploits were removed, the underlying code was still there and could be reactivated to carry out attacks.

Oversight failure

Pinduoduo has been able to grow its user base against a backdrop of the Chinese government’s regulatory clampdown on Big Tech that began in late 2020.

That year, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology launched a sweeping crackdown on apps that illegally collect and use personal data.

In 2021, Beijing passed its first comprehensive data privacy legislation.

The Personal Information Protection Law stipulates that no party should illegally collect, process or transmit personal information. They’re also banned from exploiting internet-related security vulnerabilities or engaging in actions that endanger cybersecurity.

Pinduoduo’s apparent malware would be a violation of those laws, tech policy experts say, and should have been detected by the regulator.

“This would be embarrassing for the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, because this is their job,” said Kendra Schaefer, a tech policy expert at Trivium China, a consultancy. “They’re supposed to check Pinduoduo, and the fact that they didn’t find (anything) is embarrassing for the regulator.”

The ministry has regularly published lists to name and shame apps found to have undermined user privacy or other rights. It also publishes a separate list of apps that are removed from app stores for failing to comply with regulations.

Pinduoduo did not appear on any of the lists.

CNN has reached out to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the Cyberspace Administration of China for comment.

On Chinese social media, some cybersecurity experts questioned why regulators haven’t taken any action.

“Probably none of our regulators can understand coding and programming, nor do they understand technology. You can’t even understand the malicious code when it’s shoved right in front of your face,” a cybersecurity expert with 1.8 million followers wrote last week in a viral post on Weibo, a Twitter-like platform.

The $500 billion beauty industry’s ‘green’ ambitions are a patchwork at best. And they’re falling short,"CNN —

The escalating climate crisis is shifting many people’s purchasing patterns and this extends to the $500 billion dollar global beauty industry which is grappling with a range of sustainability challenges across product manufacturing, packaging and disposal.

Strategy and consulting firm Simon Kucher’s Global Sustainability Study 2021 found 60% of consumers around the world rated sustainability as an important purchase criterion, and 35% were willing to pay more for sustainable products or services.

This shift in consumer preferences has propelled many beauty brands to set environmental goals: to move away from single-use and virgin plastics, provide recyclable, reusable and refillable packaging and offer more transparency around products’ ingredients so customers can ascertain how “green” their purchase is.

However, consumers still struggle to understand the sustainability credentials of many products, according to the British Beauty Council. This is because the industry’s clean-up efforts have been inconsistent, and fall short of making a recognizable impact in the absence of collective goal-setting, global strategy and standardized regulations.

Ingredient and branding transparency

There is no international standard for the beauty industry on how much product ingredient information to share with customers — or how to do so. Brands can set their own rules and goals, giving rise to confusion and “greenwashing,” where sustainability claims are often touted but not substantiated.

Companies often use marketing language like “clean beauty” to make it seem like their products are natural, for example, when they may not actually be organic, sustainable or ethically made.

“The term ‘clean beauty’ has become quite dangerous. It’s used to sell more products,” according to British Beauty Council CEO Millie Kendall, who added that such buzzwords are losing traction in the UK as British customers wise up to their shortcomings. “Customers need better marketing information and certification information.”

In a 2021 report calling on the industry to have “the courage to change” their business practices, the British Beauty Council wrote that, all too often, even natural ingredients involved in manufacturing products give way to “over-consumption, non-regenerative farming practices, pollution, waste and neglect.”

“The only way out of this is transparency,” Kendall told CNN.

Jen Lee, chief impact officer at US-based brand Beautycounter, said she continues to see confusion over ingredients among consumers. (In 2013, the company launched and published “The Never List,” which currently cites more than 2,800 chemicals — including heavy metals, parabens and formaldehyde — it claims to never use in its products.)

“Natural vs. synthetic ingredients has been a conversation. People think natural is safer, but it’s not always the case,” Lee explained. “Natural ingredients formulated in the industry can have toxic load. Heavy metals can occur in natural components of the earth.”

“We used to be more natural and organic,” added Sasha Plavsic, founder of makeup brand ILIA Beauty. “What was challenging is (that) raw materials were difficult to source or would come in inconsistently or products wouldn’t perform.”

Most makeup is created and molded at high temperatures, Plavsic explained. Purely organic materials often fall apart in this heat, leading to inconsistent results and subpar product performance. “Not every synthetic is bad,” Plavsic said. “Sometimes, it helps create the best in class formula.”

Unpacking plastics

The industry’s plastic packaging is a particular sustainability challenge — 95% is thrown away and the vast majority is not recycled, according to the British Beauty Council.

The cosmetics business is the fourth biggest plastic packaging user globally — after food and beverage, industrial packaging and pharmaceuticals — and plastic is about 67% of the industry’s packaging volume, according to Vantage Market Research. Beauty giant L’Oreal used 144,430 metric tons of plastic in its packaging material in 2021, for example, according to the Ellen Macarthur Foundation (EMF). Estee Lauder Companies reported its brands produced 71,600 metric tons of plastic in product packaging that same year.

And only 9% of the global plastic waste is recycled, according to a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The United States only recycles 4% of its plastic waste.

Many brands are trying to phase out harmful plastics from their operations and adopt post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic. (L’Oreal has set a target of 50% PCR plastic usage by 2025, while Estee Lauder is targeting 25% “or more” PCR plastic — but both are far from achieving their targets.)

“Between 60-70 major global brands have made unprecedented progress” in PCR plastic usage across industries, EMF’s Plastic Initiative Lead Sander DeFruyt told CNN. But DeFruyt stressed that PCR plastic must be adopted in conjunction with brands removing single and virgin plastics from their usage cycles to truly make a difference.

However, PCR plastic is not easy to find — low recycling rates around the world mean there is limited supply. Meanwhile, demand for it is growing demand across industries, DeFruyt said. This competition hikes up its price, which is already higher than virgin plastic.

Hair care brand FEKKAI claims that it used up to 95% PCR content in its packaging, but pricing and supply issues posed a challenge, forcing it to currently aim for containers and packaging that feature at least 50% PCR in its packaging.

“PCR plastic is more expensive than stock plastic. The cost is hard and then sourcing it is too,” founder Frédéric Fekkai told CNN. “PCR is close to our heart, but there is a massive demand, so finding recycled plastic is difficult.”

The weight of retail

Beauty retailers plays a pivotal — and under-utilized — role, with control over stocking decisions and supply chains. But many vary when it comes to the standards they set for brands they sell.

“Smaller businesses do more, full stop,” said Jessi Baker, founder of the technology platform Provenance, which helps brands display their sustainability credentials for customers. “They move more nimbly. Some of them are born-good brands — climate friendliness was part of their setup. They don’t need to restructure their entire supply chain. Their culture already has it compared to the larger brands who need to work hard to change.”

Sephora launched its “Clean + Planet Positive” initiative in 2021, which labeled products that met its set criteria. (This is separate from the French retailer’s “Clean at Sephora” program, which is currently facing a consumer lawsuit alleging it carries a significant percentage of products understood by customers to be harmful.) Target launched a similar program in 2022, featuring a “Target Zero” icon for both online and in-store offerings that either have reusable, recyclable, compostable or reduced plastic packaging, or feature waterless or concentrated products.

Still, many steps taken by brands and retailers do not even begin to touch on the waste and pollution generated throughout supply chains, manufacturing and shipping, all huge problems for the industry to grapple with.

The missing player

The gaps in standardization in the beauty ecosystem can, to some extent, be filled by certifications such as the US-born B Corporation, or B Corp. This accreditation, one of the most well-known in the beauty space, is issued by the non-profit B Lab, which scores a company on a variety of criteria around ethics and sustainability. However beneficial it may be among eco-conscious consumers, though, it is currently completely voluntary for brands to apply for.

Governments and multinationals enforcing regulations and setting a base line for brands to operate from when making sustainability claims would go a long way to making change, many experts and business leaders believe.

Susanne Kaufmann, founder of her namesake beauty brand, says her efforts in Austria would reap better results if more countries around the world had stricter, more uniform garbage disposal laws.

“I package our product in a recyclable material,” Kaufmann said. (Her products’ packaging, which is refillable and reusable, is made from 75% recycled plastic — and is 100% recyclable.) If I send this to the US, the garbage is not separated… and it’s not recyclable,” she explained, referring to inconsistencies in recycling laws across the United States.

And when it comes to ingredients, the European Chemicals Agency lists 2,495 substances banned from use in cosmetic products marketed for sale or use in the bloc. But the US Food and Drug administration only lists 11, making it more challenging for American consumers to find safer, greener options. The Environmental Working Group, a non-profit watchdog, studied lab tests of 51 sunscreen products in 2021 and found that only 35% of products met the EU standard, compared with 94% that passed the US standard.

However, while government can set minimum requirements, Mia Davis, vice president of sustainability and impact at beauty retailer Credo Beauty, says the needle will move in the private sector.

“Regulation can raise the floor a bit. A person who doesn’t know about any (sustainability issues) should still be able to walk into a bodega and get clean products… But that’s never going to be what the market can do,” she said. “Market leadership is key.”

In the absence of bold regulations or global standards on sustainability practices, this “leadership” — undertaken both by brands and customers in the beauty marketplace — is likely to be the most immediately impactful vector for addressing the industry’s climate shortcomings. It will take continued collective advocacy and initiative to see meaningful climate-conscious change.",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/beauty-skincare-climate/index.html,1
A new approach to a Covid-19 nasal vaccine shows early promise,"CNN —

Scientists in Germany say they’ve been able to make a nasal vaccine that can shut down a Covid-19 infection in the nose and throat, where the virus gets its first foothold in the body.

In experiments in hamsters, two doses of the vaccine – which is made with a live but weakened form of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 – blocked the virus from copying itself in the animals’ upper airways, achieving “sterilizing immunity” and preventing illness, a long-sought goal of the pandemic.

Although this vaccine has several more hurdles to clear before it gets to a doctor’s office or drug store, other nasal vaccines are in use or are nearing the finish line in clinical trials.

China and India both rolled out vaccines given through the nasal tissues last fall, though it’s not clear how well they may be working. Studies on the effectiveness of these vaccines have yet to be published, leaving much of the world to wonder whether this approach to protection really works in people.

Halting progress on next-generation Covid-19 vaccines

The US has reached something of a stalemate with Covid-19. Even with the darkest days of the pandemic behind us, hundreds of Americans are still dying daily as the infection continues to simmer in the background of our return to normal life.

As long as the virus continues to spread among people and animals, there’s always the potential for it mutate into a more contagious or more damaging version of itself. And while Covid infections have become manageable for most healthy people, they may still pose a danger to vulnerable groups such as the elderly and immunocompromised.

Researchers hope next-generation Covid-19 vaccines, which aim to shut down the virus before it ever gets a chance to make us sick and ultimately prevent the spread of infection, could make our newest resident respiratory infection less of a threat.

One way scientists are trying to do that is by boosting mucosal immunity, beefing up immune defenses in the tissues that line the upper airways, right where the virus would land and begin to infect our cells.

It’s a bit like stationing firefighters underneath the smoke alarm in your house, says study author Emanuel Wyler, a scientist at the Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association in Berlin.

The immunity that’s created by shots works throughout the body, but it resides primarily in the blood. That means it may take longer to mount a response.

“If they are already on site, they can immediately eliminate the fire, but if they’re like 2 miles away, they first need to drive there, and by that time, one-third of the house is already in full flames,” Wyler said.

Mucosal vaccines are also better at priming a different kind of first responder than injections do. They do a better job of summoning IgA antibodies, which have four arms to grab onto invaders instead of the two arms that the y-shaped IgG antibodies have. Some scientists think IgA antibodies may be less picky about their targets than IgG antibodies, which makes them better equipped to deal with new variants.

The new nasal vaccine takes a new approach to a very old idea: weakening a virus so it’s no longer a threat and then giving it to people so their immune systems can learn to recognize and fight it off. The first vaccines using this approach date to the 1870s, against anthrax and rabies. Back then, scientists weakened the agents they were using with heat and chemicals.

The researchers manipulated the genetic material in the virus to make it harder for cells to translate. This technique, called codon pair deoptimization, hobbles the virus so it can be shown to the immune system without making the body sick.

“You could imagine reading a text … and every letter is a different font, or every letter is a different size, then the text is much harder to read. And this is basically what we do in codon pair deoptimization,” Wyler said.

Promising results in animal studies

In the hamster studies, which were published Monday in the journal Nature Microbiology, two doses of the live but weakened nasal vaccine created a much stronger immune response than either two doses of an mRNA-based vaccine or one that uses an adenovirus to ferry the vaccine instructions into cells.

The researchers think the live weakened vaccine probably worked better because it closely mimics the process of a natural infection.

The nasal vaccine also previews the entire coronavirus for the body, not just its spike proteins like current Covid-19 vaccines do, so the hamsters were able to make immune weapons against a wider range of targets.

As promising as all this sounds, vaccine experts say caution is warranted. This vaccine still has to pass more tests before it’s ready for use, but they say the results look encouraging.

“They did a very nice job. This is obviously a competent and thoughtful team that did this work, and impressive in the scope of what they did. Now it just needs to be repeated,” perhaps in primates and certainly in humans before it can be widely used, said Dr. Greg Poland, who designs vaccines at the Mayo Clinic. He was not involved in the new research.

The study began in 2021, before the Omicron variant was around, so the vaccine tested in these experiments was made with the original strain of the coronavirus. In the experiments, when they infected animals with Omicron, the live but weakened nasal vaccine still performed better than the others, but its ability to neutralize the virus was diminished. Researchers think it will need an update.

It also needs to be tested in humans, and Wyler says they’re working on that. The scientists have partnered with a Swiss company called RocketVax to start phase I clinical trials.

Other vaccines are further along, but the progress has been “slow and halting,” Poland said. Groups working on these vaccines are struggling to raise the steep costs of getting a new vaccine to market, and they’re doing it in a setting where people tend to think the vaccine race has been won and done.

In reality, Poland said, we’re far from that. All it would take is another Omicron-level shift in the evolution of the virus, and we could be back at square one, with no effective tools against the coronavirus.

“That’s foolish. We should be developing a pan-coronavirus vaccine that does induce mucosal immunity and that is long-lived,” he said.

More on the way

At least four nasal vaccines for Covid-19 have reached late-stage testing in people, according to the World Health Organization’s vaccine tracker.

The nasal vaccines in use in China and India rely on harmless adenoviruses to ferry their instructions into cells, although effectiveness data for these has not been published.

Two other nasal vaccines are finishing human studies.

One, a recombinant vaccine that can be produced cheaply in chicken eggs, the same way many flu vaccines are, is being put through its paces by researchers at Mount Sinai in New York City.

Another, like the German vaccine, uses a live but weakened version of the virus. It’s being developed by a company called Codagenix. Results of those studies, which were carried out in South America and Africa, may come later this year.

The German team says it’s eagerly watching for the Codagenix data.

“They will be very important in order to know where whether this kind of attempt is basically promising or not,” Wyler said.

They have reason to worry. Respiratory infections have proved to be tough targets for inhaled vaccines.

FluMist, a live but weakened form of the flu virus, works reasonably well in children but doesn’t help adults as much. The reason is thought to be that adults already have immune memory for the flu, and when the virus is injected into the nose, the vaccine mostly boosts what’s already there.

Still, some of the most potent vaccines such as the vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella use live attenuated viruses, so it’s a promising approach.

Another consideration is that live vaccines can’t be taken by everyone. People with very compromised immunity are often cautioned against using live vaccines because even these very weakened viruses may be risky for them.

“Although it’s strongly attenuated, it’s still a real virus,” Wyler said, so it would have to be used carefully.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/health/nasal-vaccine-sterilizing-immunity/index.html,1

"Israeli military veterans, a backbone of protest movement, vow to keep demonstrating","Tel Aviv CNN —

In a sea of Israeli flags, Yiftach Golov holds one that looks a little different.

Among the hundreds of thousands of protesters who took to the streets for the 13th week in a row on Saturday, Golov hoists a brown flag that represents a group called “Brother and Sisters in Arms.”

They are veterans – many, like Golov, from elite forces – who now feel they are fighting on a new battlefield: To save Israeli democracy.

“We believe this is our responsibility to go once again called to the flag of the nation to stop this madness to defend Israel,” Golov said, as he weaved his way through the protesters on Tel Aviv’s Kaplan street, between the high-rises that house many of Israel’s high tech companies.

During the second intifada, in the early 2000s, Golov served in a special forces reconnaissance unit. He was never before particularly political, focusing more on getting his PhD in biophysics from Tel Aviv University.

But when the protest movement against the Israeli government’s judicial overhaul plan began in January, Golov attended one a demonstration and soon became one of thousands of veterans, and now military reservists, who have taken up the cause as their new mission.

Some, including elite Air Force reservists, have taken it a step further, threatening not to heed the call to train or even serve in protest of the government’s plans planned judicial changes, which would give the governing parties more control over Israel’s judiciary.

Others have taken to becoming some of the most active organizers and demonstrators. Last week, a group from Brothers and Sisters in Arms protested by carrying a figure wrapped in the Israeli flag on a stretcher, the way they would carry a wounded comrade off the field.

While Golov says he has not taken the drastic step to refuse service, he understands the motivation.

“We’re fighting for justice and liberty, just like the American story, that’s the values that that are being represented symbolized back when we look at our flag, that’s something that was lacking lacking for the last few decades. So basically, we reclaim the flag,” he said.

Fellow members of the group, all wearing brown shirts with the organization’s logo, come up and say hello. They’re sprinkled all throughout the protests. One is even leading the “Pink Front,” a group of coordinated drummers who look like they are dressed for a rave, and often lead the chants at the protests.

They’re using skills they learned in the military – how to organize, how to mobilize – now for the protests. But more importantly, they say they have the same type of motivation.

“The very deep feeling that you are part of something bigger than yourself, that (you’re) allowed to sacrifice anything that is needed, whether it’s your career, health, seriously mental health,” Golov said. “We all have a mission, you’re willing to do it at any cost. You’re very determined, you know that you are on the right side, you’re carrying the torch of light. That keeps us being highly motivated despite the fact that we’re not sleeping for days.”

Israel’s protest movement is made up of many disparate groups, but the pressure from Israel’s much vaunted veterans has been seen as a key to moving the needle.

Last Monday, after weeks of sustained protests and the largest general strike in Israeli history, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a pause to the legislation, to allow time for negotiations with the opposition.

But despite the announcements, protesters are still out in the streets in large numbers. CNN affiliate Channel 12 in Israel estimated the size of Saturday’s demonstration in Tel Aviv at about 150,000 people. Organizers claimed it was 230,000.

Last week’s mass protests and widespread strike action came after Netanyahu said he had decided to fire Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for advocating a delay in passing the legislation – a move that Netanyahu has since delayed, sources told CNN, due to “the present security situation.”

In his televised speech calling for a delay, Gallant had said the pause in the legislation was needed “for the security of Israel,” citing the refusal of some Israel Defense Forces reservists to train in protest of the government plans. He said pressing ahead with the proposals could threaten Israel’s security.

Under pressure at home and from allies abroad, Netanyahu said he would delay votes on the remaining legislation until after the Knesset’s Passover recess in April “to give time for a real chance for a real debate.”

“Out of the responsibility to the nation, I decided to delay … the vote, in order to give time for discussion,” he added.

But Netanyahu indicated that the delay was only temporary. He insisted that the overhaul was necessary, and reiterated criticism of refusal to train or serve in the military in protest at the planned changes. “Refusing is the end of our country,” he said.

Many protesters don’t believe that the pause is real, or say it’s simply a stalling tactic to give Netanyahu some breathing room and get the protesters to go home before he plows on with the reforms.

“We will start doing deactivation only when we will know 100% that Israel state will stay a functional democratic country. Whatever needs to be done for that,” Golov said.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/middleeast/israel-protests-military-veterans-intl-cmd/index.html,1
Erdogan’s political fate may be determined by Turkey’s Kurds,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.

Abu Dhabi, UAE CNN —

Turkey’s persecuted pro-Kurdish party has emerged as a kingmaker in the country’s upcoming election, playing a decisive role that may just tip the balance enough to unseat two-decade ruler Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

In a key setback to the Turkish president and leader of the Justice and Development Party (AK Party), the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) last month announced that it would not put forward its own presidential candidate, a move analysts say allows its supporters to vote for Erdogan’s main rival.

“We are facing a turning point that will shape the future of Turkey and (its) society,” said the HDP in a statement on March 23. “To fulfill our historical responsibility against the one-man rule, we will not field a presidential candidate in (the) May 14 elections.”

It is a twist of irony for the Turkish strongman, who spent the better half of the past decade cracking down on the party after it began chipping away at his voter base. Its former leader Selahattin Demirtas has been in prison for nearly seven years and the party faces possible closure by a court for suspected collusion with the militant Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and affiliated groups. But its influence may nonetheless determine the course of Turkey’s politics.

The HDP’s decision not to field a candidate came just three days after head of the Republican People’s Party (CHP) Kemal Kilicdaroglu, Erdogan’s main rival, visited the party’s co-chairs. He told reporters that the solution to Turkey’s problems, “including the Kurdish problem” lies in parliament,” according to Turkish media.

Kilicdaroglu, who represents the six-party Nation Alliance opposition bloc, is the strongest contender to run against Erdogan in years. And while the HDP hasn’t yet announced whether it will put its weight behind him, analysts say it is the kingmaker in the elections.

“It was a carefully crafted political discourse,” Hisyar Ozsoy, deputy co-chair of the HDP and a member of parliament from the predominantly Kurdish province of Diyarbakir, told CNN. “We are not going to have our own candidate, and we will leave it to the international community to interpret it the way they wish.”

Experts say the crackdown on the HDP is rooted in the threat it poses to Erdogan politically, as well as its position as one of the main parties representing Turkey’s Kurds, an ethnic minority from which a separatist militant movement has emerged.

The party and the Kurdish people have had a complicated relationship with Erdogan. The leader courted the Kurds in earlier years by granting them more rights and reversing restrictions on the use of their language. Relations with the HDP were also cordial once, as Erdogan worked with the party on a brief peace process with the PKK.

But ties between Erdogan and the HDP later turned sour, and the HDP fell under a sweeping crackdown aimed at the PKK and their affiliates.

Kurds are the biggest minority in Turkey, making up between 15% and 20% of the population, according to Minority Rights Group International.

It is unclear if the HDP will endorse Kilicdaroglu, but analysts say that the deliberate distance may be beneficial for the opposition candidate.

Precarious position

The accusations against the HDP place it in a precarious position during the elections. It currently faces a case in Turkey’s Constitutional Court over suspected ties to the PKK, which is designated as a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Knowing it may be banned at any moment, its candidates are running under the Green Left Party in parliament.

If the opposition is seen as allying with the HDP, Erdogan’s AK Party may use its influence in the media to discredit it as being pro-PKK, said Murat Somer, a political science professor at Koc University in Istanbul and author of Return to Point Zero, a book on the Turkish-Kurdish question in Turkey.

The HDP’s threat to Erdogan’s hold on power became apparent after the June 2015 election, the first general election it participated in. It won 13% of the seats, denying the ruling AK Party its majority for the first time since 2002. Erdogan, however, called a snap election five months later, which led to a drop in the HDP’s support to 10.7%, as well as the restoration of the AK Party’s overall majority.

“They are a kingmaker in these elections because the HDP gets about half of the votes of the Kurdish population in Turkey,” said Somer, adding that the other, more conservative Kurdish voters have traditionally voted for Erdogan’s AK Party. And last month, the Free Cause Party (HUDA-PAR), a tiny Kurdish-Islamist party announced support for Erdogan in the elections. The party has never won seats in parliament.

The HDP knows that its position is key to the outcome of next month’s vote, but that it’s also in a delicate situation.

“We want to play the game wisely, and we need to be very careful,” said Ozsoy, adding that the party wants to avoid a “contaminated political climate” where the elections are polarized “between a very ugly ultra-nationalist discourse against Kilicdaroglu and others.”

The party was founded in 2012 with a number of aims, said Ozsoy, one of which was “peaceful and democratic resolution of the Kurdish conflict.”

Somer said that the party was seen to be “an initiative” of the PKK, which later led to a heavy government crackdown on it in the name of counterterrorism.

Its former leader Demirtas remains an influential figure.

The Turkish government has been trying to link the HDP to the PKK but has so far failed to prove “a real connection,” said Asli Aydintasbas, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC.

A post-Erdogan Turkey may give some breathing space to the Kurds and Kurdish-dominated parties in Turkey, Aydintasbas told CNN, noting that many Kurdish voters have recently left Erdogan’s camp. “For HDP, this is more than just an ideological choice,” she said. “It’s a matter of survival.”

Ozsoy says his party understands what’s at stake, not only for Turkey’s Kurds but for all its minorities.

“We are aware of our responsibility here. We are aware of our role. We know we are in a kingmaker position,” the HDP lawmaker said.

The digest

Two women arrested for not wearing hijab following ‘yogurt attack’

Two women were arrested in Iran for failing to wear the hijab in public, after a man threw a tub of yogurt at them at a store in the city of Shandiz on Thursday, according to Mizan News Agency, the state-run outlet for Iran’s judiciary.

Background: A video and report published by the Mizan News Agency showed footage of the man approaching one of the unveiled women and speaking to her before he grabs a tub of yogurt and throws it, hitting both women on the head. The video appears to show a male staff member removing the man from the store. The two women were arrested, as well as the man who threw the yogurt, according to local media.

Why it matters: Iranians have taken to the streets in protest for several months against Iran’s mandatory hijab law, as well as other political and social issues across the country. The Iranian government has continued to crack down on the protests, and on Saturday, Iran’s Ministry of Interior said that the “hijab is an unquestionable religious necessity.”

Oil prices surge after OPEC+ producers announce surprise cuts

Oil prices spiked Monday after OPEC+ producers unexpectedly announced that they would cut output. Brent crude, the global benchmark, jumped 5.31% to $84.13 a barrel, while WTI, the US benchmark, rose 5.48% to $79.83. Both were the sharpest price rises in almost a year. The collective output cut by the nine members of OPEC+ totals 1.66 million barrels per day.

Background: The reductions are on top of the 2 million barrels per day (bpd) cuts announced by OPEC+ in October and bring the total volume of cuts by OPEC+ to 3.66 million bpd, equal to 3.7% of global demand. In a note Sunday, Goldman Sachs analysts said the move was unexpected but “consistent with the new OPEC+ doctrine to act pre-emptively because they can, without significant losses in market share.”

Why it matters: The White House pushed back on the cuts by OPEC+. “We don’t think cuts are advisable at this moment given market uncertainty – and we’ve made that clear,” a spokesperson for the National Security Council said. “We’re focused on prices for American consumers, not barrels.” In October, OPEC+’s decision to cut production had already rankled the White House. US President Joe Biden pledged at the time that Saudi Arabia would suffer “consequences.” But so far, his administration appears to have backed off on its vows to punish the kingdom.

Iran blames Israel for the killing of second IRGC officer, vows to respond

A second Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) officer died following an attack in Syria on Friday, according to Iranian state media on Sunday. Iranian state media said the Iranian military adviser died after an Israeli attack near the Syrian capital Damascus left him wounded. The attack also killed another IRGC officer. In a tweet on Sunday, Iranian government spokesman Ali Bahadori Jahromi said the alleged Israeli attack wouldn’t go unanswered. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said on Sunday that Iran has the right to respond to “state terrorism.”

Background: The Friday airstrike hit a “site in the Damascus countryside,” Syrian state news agency SANA said. Israel declined CNN’s request for comment on reports of airstrikes near Damascus on Friday, saying its military doesn’t comment on reports in the foreign media. Iranian influence has grown in Syria since a civil war broke out in the country more than a decade ago, with the IRGC building a substantial presence as “advisers” to the Syrian armed forces.

Why it matters: The Israeli military declined to comment, but it has previously claimed responsibility for attacks it has described as Iranian-linked targets in Syria. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting Sunday: “We are exacting a high price from the regimes that support terrorism, beyond Israel’s borders. I suggest that our enemies not err. Israel’s internal debate will not detract one iota from our determination, strength and ability to act against our enemies on all fronts, wherever and whenever necessary.”

China and Brazil have reached an agreement to ditch USD and use their own currencies—China Daily pic.twitter.com/q33U4kVO5Q — IRNA News Agency (@IrnaEnglish) March 30, 2023

An Iranian state news outlet is gloating at what it sees as the demise of the US dollar.

IRNA recreated a popular meme to mark China and Brazil’s decision to reportedly ditch the US dollar as an intermediary in trade, citing the Chinese state news outlet, China Daily. It shows two men representing China and Brazil posing in front of a grave labelled “USD.”

The meme was pinned to the top of IRNA’s Twitter page, and was met with laughter and ridicule. “Dream on,” said another user, pointing to the dollar’s use as the main reserve currency around the world.

China Daily said that the agreement was part of “the rising global use of the Chinese renminbi.” It would reportedly enable China and Brazil to conduct trade and financial transactions using local currencies instead of the dollar.

Micron Technology: China probes US chip maker for cybersecurity risks as tech tension escalates,"Hong Kong CNN —

China has launched a cybersecurity probe into Micron Technology, one of America’s largest memory chip makers, in apparent retaliation after US allies in Asia and Europe announced new restrictions on the sale of key technology to Beijing.

The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) will review products sold by Micron in the country, according to a statement by the watchdog late on Friday.

The move is aimed at “ensuring the security of key information infrastructure supply chains, preventing cybersecurity risks caused by hidden product problems, and maintaining national security,” it noted.

It came on the same day that Japan, a US ally, said it would restrict the export of advanced chip manufacturing equipment to countries including China, following similar moves by the United States and the Netherlands.

Washington and its allies have announced curbs on China’s semiconductor industry, which strike at the heart of Beijing’s bid to become a tech superpower.

Last month, the Netherlands also unveiled new restrictions on overseas sales of semiconductor technology, citing the need to protect national security. In October, the United States banned Chinese companies from buying advanced chips and chipmaking equipment without a license.

Micron told CNN it was aware of the review.

“We are in communication with the CAC and are cooperating fully,” it said, adding that it stands by the security of its products. “Micron’s product shipments, engineering, manufacturing, sales and other functions are operating as normal.”

Risks expected

Shares in Micron sank 4.4% on Wall Street Friday following the news, the biggest drop in more than three months. On Monday, they closed another 1.2% lower. Micron derives more than 10% of its revenue from China.

In an earlier filing, the Idaho-based company had warned of such risks.

“The Chinese government may restrict us from participating in the China market or may prevent us from competing effectively with Chinese companies,” it said last week.

China has strongly criticized restrictions on tech exports, saying last month it “firmly opposes” such measures.

In efforts to boost growth and job creation, Beijing is seeking to woo foreign investments as it grapples with mounting economic challenges. The newly minted premier Li Qiang and several top economic officials have been rolling out the welcome wagon for global CEOs and promising they would “provide a good environment and services.”

But Beijing has also exerted growing pressure on foreign companies to bring them into line with its agenda.

Last month, authorities closed the Beijing office of Mintz Group, a US corporate intelligence firm, and detained five local staff.

Days earlier, they suspended Deloitte’s operations in Beijing for three months and imposed a fine of $31 million over alleged lapses in its work auditing a state-owned distressed debt manager.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/tech/china-micron-probe-us-chip-war-intl-hnk/index.html,1

"China Renaissance suspends trading, delays results after founder Bao Fan goes missing","Hong Kong CNN —

China Renaissance, a top dealmaker in the country’s tech industry, said it would suspend trading of its shares and delay the release of its annual results because it still can’t get in touch with its founder.

Bao Fan, 52, started the boutique investment bank in 2005 and has been unreachable since the middle of February, according to the company. Shares in China Renaissance have plunged since Bao went missing, at one point dropping as much as 50%.

China Renaissance said in late February that it had learned Bao was “cooperating in an investigation” being carried out by certain authorities in the country. It gave no other details.

Chinese media have reported Bao might be assisting in an investigation related to a former executive at China Renaissance.

In a filing on Sunday, China Renaissance said auditors couldn’t complete their work or sign off on their report because of Bao’s absence. The board was also unable to give an estimate about when it would be able to approve its audited results for 2022 or dispatch its annual report by an April 30 deadline as required by Hong Kong’s listing rules.

Trading in the company’s shares was suspended from Monday as a result.

Bao is known as a veteran dealmaker who works closely with top technology companies in China. He helped broker the 2015 merger between two of the country’s leading food delivery services, Meituan and Dianping. Today, the combined company’s “super app” platform is ubiquitous in China.

His team has also invested in US-listed Chinese electric vehicle makers Nio (NIO) and Li Auto and helped Chinese internet giants Baidu (BIDU) and JD.com (JD) complete their secondary listings in Hong Kong.

Over the weekend, China’s top anti-graft watchdog launched an investigation into Liu Liange, former party secretary and chairman of Bank of China, according to a statement by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Supervision Commission. The bank is state-owned and one of the country’s four biggest lenders.

Liu is suspected of “serious violations of discipline and law,” the statement said. He is among the most senior financial executives targeted in a broader financial crackdown by President Xi Jinping.

In January, Wang Bin, former party chief and chairman of China Life Insurance, was charged by national-level prosecutors with taking bribes and hiding overseas savings.

HSBC spinoff: Bank’s top execs face tense shareholders in Hong Kong calling for a breakup,"Hong Kong CNN —

HSBC’s top brass defended their strategy Monday to frustrated shareholders in the lender’s largest market, as Europe’s biggest bank continued to face calls to be split up.

At an informal shareholder meeting in Hong Kong, Chairman Mark Tucker and CEO Noel Quinn took questions from investors on issues ranging from how the bank was approaching demands for an overhaul of its business to its purchase of Silicon Valley Bank’s UK arm.

In prepared remarks, Tucker and Quinn each reiterated the board’s recommendation that shareholders vote against a resolution on the docket for its annual general meeting in May that would force the bank to come up with a plan to spin off or reorganize its Asian business — the lender’s main source of profits.

Tucker said the board was unanimous in its opposition to the resolution, stating plainly: “It would not be in your interest to split the bank.”

He said the board had previously reviewed a range of options for restructuring the bank, and concluded that such alternatives would “materially destroy value for shareholders,” including dividends.

“Our strategy is working,” Tucker told the room of more than 1,000 shareholders. “Our current strategy is moving dividends up.”

Calls for a breakup

HSBC has been facing calls to separate its Asian business from the rest of the bank over the past year.

Shareholders in Hong Kong — where HSBC is a mainstay of many retail investors’ portfolios — contend that the London-based lender’s performance has been dragged down by its businesses in other regions.

Quinn addressed those complaints head-on Monday, saying “our profits in Hong Kong and the UK are no longer being dragged down by underperformance elsewhere. The group is performing well as a whole.”

Pressed later by a shareholder on the issue, Quinn said a breakup of the bank would result in “significant revenue loss” because much of its business relied on cross-border transactions.

Investors have also been unhappy with HSBC scrapping its dividend in 2020, at the request of British regulators. They argue that if the lender cordoned off its activities in Asia, it would no longer have to expose Hong Kong shareholders to requests in other jurisdictions.

Christine Fong, a district council member in Hong Kong, said she represented about 500 small shareholders who had been affected by the dividend cancellation.

“Street hawkers, taxi drivers or teachers — they all relied on the dividend to pay for their regular expenses, like mortgage, insurance payments, school fees,” Fong told CNN.

“That’s why, three years ago, what HSBC did upset those small minority shareholders.”

Fong has now joined calls for shareholders to vote in favor of the proposal for the bank to spin off its Asian business, despite the lender bringing back its dividend in 2021, albeit at a lower level.

Ken Lui, an activist shareholder in Hong Kong who put the resolution together, doubled down on his call for support ahead of the meeting Monday.

The resolution will require 75% of votes to be passed in May, but “nothing is impossible,” he told reporters outside the meeting venue.

Lui, who said he personally held a stake worth 100 million Hong Kong dollars ($12.7 million), laid out plans for his team to focus on “targeted outreach to institutional shareholders to present our case and gain their support.”

His group will also canvass 18 districts of Hong Kong “to tell HSBC shareholders that they finally have a chance to speak for themselves and protect their rights through voting,” he added.

The Ping An question

HSBC is also facing pressure from its largest shareholder.

Ping An (PNGAY), China’s biggest insurer, holds an 8% stake in HSBC and has backed calls for the bank to rethink its structure.

In a series of remarks made public by the Chinese firm last November, Huang Yong, chairman of Ping An’s asset management arm, said “we will support any initiatives including a spinoff that are conducive to improve HSBC’s performance and value.”

Since then, the insurance giant’s views haven’t changed, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The source told CNN that Ping An has been calling for HSBC to explore a reorganization, with an eye on boosting its valuation and simplifying its regulatory obligations around the globe.

The insurer has not recommended a specific path forward but will support any initiatives, including a spinoff of its Asian business, that could boost its stock performance or value, the person added. Ping An did not immediately respond to a request for comment on how it planned to vote at the upcoming general meeting.

Banking sector turmoil

HSBC’s leaders were also asked Monfday why the bank had scooped up the British unit of SVB following the stunning collapse of its parent in the United States. The purchase was made for £1 ($1.20) last month, just days after SVB had folded.

Critics have questioned HSBC’s ability to perform adequate due diligence on SVB UK’s customers because of how quickly the deal came together.

“Did HSBC look into the clients of SVB in detail? Say, the financial statement — whether they can pay back the loan?” said Fong.

Quinn and Tucker defended the acquisition, calling it a good business opportunity that allowed the bank to gain hundreds of innovative startups as customers. They pushed back on the notion that management hadn’t had time to carry out proper due diligence.

Tucker also weighed in on recent tumult in the banking industry, saying he did not expect an “immediate impact” on HSBC.

“After the collapse of a number of smaller regional banks and the takeover of Credit Suisse, the share prices of all banks have been suppressed,” he noted.

But he said he did not believe such developments represented “a systemic risk” to the sector. “I do expect a period of uncertainty” before nerves settle, he added.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/business/hsbc-spin-off-hk-shareholder-meeting-intl-hnk/index.html,1

Premarket stocks: CEOs are tired of being held responsible for gun regulation,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.

New York CNN —

Americans have grown used to corporate executives treading the well-worn paths of the Northeast corridor to convene alongside elected officials in Washington, DC, and discuss geopolitics, policy and all that’s in-between.

In 2017, major CEOs from across the country came together to oppose North Carolina’s transgender bathroom law. In 2019, they called abortion bans “bad for business.”

After the deadly attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, many of corporate America’s biggest names denounced the rioters and pledged to halt their political giving.

Recently, more than 1,000 companies promised to voluntarily curtail their operations in Russia in protest of Moscow’s war on Ukraine.

Dick’s Sporting Goods stopped selling semi-automatic, assault-style rifles at stores and Citigroup put new restrictions on gun sales by business customers after the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, in 2018.

A year later, after mass shootings at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, and a nightclub in Dayton, Ohio, Walmart ended handgun ammunition sales.

Corporate leadership has long been vocal on the issue of gun control – in 2019 and again this past summer nearly 150 major companies – including Lululemon, Lyft, Bain Capital, Bloomberg LP, Permanente Medical Group and Unilever – called gun violence a “public health crisis” and demanded that the US Senate pass legislation to address it.

That’s why corporate America’s silence in the wake of the latest mass shooting at a school in Nashville is so jarring. The United States has come to rely on the increasing power of large corporations as political advocates.

But Yale professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a vocal advocate of corporate social responsibility who has a direct line to major CEOs around the globe, said that top executives are forlorn. Their previous efforts haven’t done much to push the needle on gun control legislation and without more backing, they don’t know what else they can do at the moment, he said.

Before the Bell spoke with Sonnenfeld, who runs Yale School of Management’s Chief Executive Leadership Institute, a nonprofit educational and research institute focused on CEO leadership and corporate governance.

This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

Before the Bell: CEOs have been quiet about gun reform since the latest mass school shooting in Nashville, have you heard anything about plans to speak out?

Jeffrey Sonnenfeld: Where is everybody else? Where is all of civil society? CEOs are just one group of people and it’s like we’re turning to them to be our saviors on every topic. They’ve joined causes with valor and nobility but they can’t just be taking cause after cause as if there’s nobody else in society. The social change that happened in the 1960s wasn’t being led primarily by CEOs. Social changes really happened when we saw the interfaith activity of clergy locking arms and canvassing legislators. We saw campuses alive and aroused. Where’s all the student activism?

The CEOs are still the most active even if they’re less active than they were six months ago. They’re not there as hired hands of shareholders to fill the role of politicians and civic leaders. They’re there to join that chorus, but they don’t want to be the only one singing.

So is this what you’re hearing from top CEOs? Have they gotten tired of advocating?

I just got off of a CEO call on voting rights and this morning we had a forum on sustainability – CEOs are still the most active on these fronts. It’s the same thing on immigration reform. If a CEO was working an 18 hour day on a 12 day week, they still couldn’t address all of the issues that need addressing.

The nation’s CEOs are waiting for everybody else to join them. They don’t need to restate something they’ve already stated. They’ve jumped in the pool, where’s everybody else?

So what do you think has led to this complacency amongst Americans and the growing reliance on CEOs to advocate on our behalf?

They’ve taken a very strong stance and they’ve gone out further than the general public. They are where the general public is on surveys, but they’re not where the general public is on action in the streets. So we’re ready for others to now do something. Enough already on saying ‘what are the CEOs doing?’ Social capital is as valuable as financial capital. CEOs understand that in their soul, they want there to be social capital. They want there to be public trust, but they need the rest of civil society to join them. And that’s their frustration.

It sounds like CEOs are frustrated?

Yeah, they’re frustrated.

But don’t these CEOs hold the purse strings in terms of donating to powerful politicians?

You would think that, but since the 2020 elections much less of campaign contributions have come from big business. Since the 2021 run on the Capitol, a lot of businesses either had an official moratorium or they’ve given mere pennies to politicians. The common impression on the street that CEOs are controlling campaign purses strings is 100% wrong.

Tesla sales again fall short of production

By CNN’s Chris Isidore

Tesla reported. a modest 4% rise in sales in the first quarter compared to the final three months of last year, despite a series of price cuts on its lower priced vehicles and talk by CEO Elon Musk about strong demand at those lower prices.

The first quarter also marked the fourth straight quarter that Tesla has produced more vehicles than it has delivered to customers. Some of that may be due to the ramp up in production at two new factories, one in Texas, the other in Germany, which opened last spring, and a lag between that increased production and sales.

Tesla said there was an increase in the number of its more expensive models, the Model S and Model X, in transit to Europe, the Middle East and Africa, as well as to the Asia Pacific region.

But it does mean that over the last 12 months Tesla has produced 78,000 more cars than it has sold, suggesting that talk of strong demand by Tesla executives may not be backed up by the numbers.

“Early this year, we had a price adjustment. After that, we actually generated a huge demand, more than we can produce, really,” said Tom Zhu, Tesla’s executive in charge of global production and sales. “And as Elon said, as long as you offer a product with value at affordable price, you don’t have to worry about demand.”",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html,1

Why do we bury our departed loved ones in a cemetery? A primary purpose is to provide survivors with an opportunity to grieve and gain a sense of closure. The cemetery is a place for the living as much as it is a place for the dead.

But what about when the dearly departed are not human – but our pets?

Eric Tourigny Eric Tourigny

The Spanish city of Barcelona recently announced that it will be investing in the establishment of the country’s first public pet cemetery. Set to open next year, it will offer both burials and cremations – with an estimated 7,000 carried out each year.

For me, as someone who has spent years researching the development of pet cemeteries elsewhere in the world, this news came as a shock. Barcelona is a densely populated city with limited privately owned land – one where 50% of families own a pet.

How did a city that is home to 180,000 dogs not already have a public pet cemetery? Until now, the service was only provided by the private sector, according to Barcelona’s Councilor for Climate Emergency and Ecological Transition, Eloi Badia. He added that the municipal-funded initiative was sparked by “constant public demand.”

After all, public pet cemeteries have been around in Europe and the Americas since the late 19th century. Britain’s first public pet cemetery appeared in London’s Hyde Park in 1881. New York’s Hartsdale pet cemetery was founded in 1896, followed a few years later by Paris’ ornate Cimetière des Chiens in 1899.

A grave discovery

I became interested in the history of modern pet burial practices while investigating the archaeological record of a centuries-old house in Toronto. I came across a (very) large dog buried in the back garden which, according to the historical record, was occupied between 1840 and 1870.

This dog survived to an elderly age but, sadly, suffered from degenerative joint disease and severe infections during his last months. His ailments progressed to such a state that suggest he received some level of care in his final weeks. He then was buried in a personal plot behind the family home.

This elderly dog led me to think about the different ways people interact with the bodies of their pets after death. Could this behavior be reflective of the relationships they held with their animals in life? In this instance, why take the time to carefully bury a dog in its own space when other, arguably easier options existed?

This, after all, was an era when people often disposed of their dead pets in the river, or might have sold their bodies for meat and skin.

Good hygiene is an obvious reason to choose a burial – no one wants decomposing animal bodies in the street or their garden – but that wouldn’t immediately warrant a personalized, dedicated burial and gravestone.

The most straight forward option would be to dispose of a deceased animal with the household waste. But such treatment would evidently feel less ceremonious and would not offer appropriate emotional closure to what was likely an important relationship.

A member of the family

Like the burial of people, the burial of pets is an intimate cultural practice, one that changes over time and is reflective of the changing relationships that a society has with its cherished creatures.

My study of historic gravestones and epitaphs in Britain from the Victorian period to today shows this changing human-animal relationship. In the 19th century, gravestones were often dedicated to a “loving friend” or “devoted companion,” suggesting pets were mostly considered important friends.

By the early 20th century, pets had become members of the family – evidenced by the appearance of family surnames on the gravestones, and loving epitaphs written by “Mummy and Daddy.”

Society’s changing attitude towards the role of animals in the afterlife can also be found. Fast-forward a few decades later, and gravestones were more likely to reference a reunion then earlier ones. For example, the owners of Denny, the “brave little cat” buried in an east London cemetery in 1952, wrote on his epitaph “God bless until we meet again.”

I wonder what the epitaphs in Barcelona’s new cemetery will reveal about modern Catalan relationships with animals.

Over time, our ways of treating our animal dead appear to reflect an even closer relationship in life. Once strictly forbidden by law, the last decade saw many jurisdictions, like the state of New York, allowing the co-burial of cremated animals and people, which will undoubtedly lead to changing funerary and commemoration practices for both humans and animals.

Modern mourning

For me, the most remarkable similarity between modern and historic pet cemeteries is the striking evidence for the heartbreak and taboos around grieving for animals.

The connection that someone has with their pet can be just as strong and just as significant as their relationships with other humans. Yet today, as in over 100 years ago, individuals continue to struggle to find the appropriate outlet to express their pain, hiding heartache for fear of the social repercussions that might come with public acknowledgment of the existence of such a bond.

The RSPCA reassures the public on its website that they should not feel shame for their grief. In the UK, charities like the Blue Cross and Rainbow Bridge Pet Loss Grief Center offer counseling to bereaved humans.

Close relationships between people and animals have existed for millennia, but in western European cultures, there were few acceptable ways to mourn that relationship. As society becomes more accepting of the importance of human-animal relationships to our collective wellbeing, it is not surprising to see us follow rituals resembling those we use to mourn the loss of our closest human relationships.

At an estimated cost of €200 ($217) per service at the new Barcelona cemetery, it is important to acknowledge that this opportunity to grieve will not be financially available to everyone in the city.

This will not be a space for all of the city’s pets. Pet owners may opt to keep cremated remains within their home or spread out ashes in a meaningful location instead. Online forums and digital pet cemeteries also provide other opportunities to commemorate the relationship and express grief.

Scientists film deepest ever fish on seabed off Japan,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

Cruising at a depth of 8,336 meters (over 27,000 feet) just above the seabed, a young snailfish has become the deepest fish ever filmed by scientists during a probe into the abyss of the northern Pacific Ocean.

Scientists from University of Western Australia and Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology released footage of the snailfish on Sunday filmed last September by sea robots in deep trenches off Japan.

Along with the filming the deepest snailfish, the scientists physically caught two other specimens at 8,022 meters and set another record for the deepest catch.

Previously, the deepest snailfish ever spotted was at 7,703 meters in 2008, while scientists had never been able to collect fish from anywhere below 8,000 meters.

“What is significant is that it shows how far a particular type of fish will descend in the ocean,” said marine biologist Alan Jamieson, founder of the Minderoo-UWA Deep Sea Research Centre, who led the expedition.

These two fish were caught at a depth of just over 8,000 meters in the Japan Trench in the northern Pacific Ocean. Caladan Oceanic

Scientists are filming in the trenches off Japan as part of a 10-year study into the deepest fish populations in the world. Snailfish are members of Liparidae family, and while most snailfish live in shallow water, others survive at some of the greatest depths ever recorded, Jamieson said.

During the two-month survey last year, three “landers” – automatic sea robots fitted with high-resolution cameras – were dropped into three trenches – the Japan, Izu-Ogasawara and Ryukyu trenches – at varying depths.

In the Izu-Ogasawara trench, footage showed the deepest snailfish hovering calmly alongside other crustaceans on the seabed.

Jamieson classified the fish as a juvenile and said younger deep sea snailfish often stay as deep as possible to avoid being eaten by bigger predators that swim at shallower depths.

Another clip shot at between 7,500 and 8,200 meters in the same trench showed a colony of fish and crustaceans munching at bait tied to an undersea robot.

Images of the two captured snailfish – identified as Pseudoliparis belyaevi – provide a rare glimpse of the unique features that help the deep sea species survive the extreme environment.

They have tiny eyes, a translucent body, and their lack of swim bladder, which helps other fish float, works to their advantage, Jamieson said.

The professor said the Pacific Ocean is particularly conducive to vibrant activity due to its warm southern current, which encourages sea creatures to go deeper, while its abundant marine life provides a good source of food for bottom feeders.

Scientists would like to know more about creatures living at extreme depths, but cost is the constraint, Jamieson said, adding that each lander alone costs them $200,000 to assemble and operate.

“The challenges are that technology has been expensive and scientists don’t have a lot of money,” he said.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/asia/deepest-fish-filmed-off-japan-scn-intl-hnk/index.html,1
What OPEC’s surprise oil cut means for US gas prices,"New York CNN —

OPEC and its allies’ surprise move to slash oil production will soon be felt at US gas pumps.

The group known as OPEC+ announced Sunday it would cut oil production by more than 1.6 million barrels a day starting in May, running through the end of the year. The news sent both Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, and WTI, the US benchmark, up about 6% in trading Monday.

The production cut announcement also had an immediate impact on gasoline futures, which will be passed onto US drivers much more quickly than the spike in oil prices. RBOB, the most closely watched wholesale gasoline price, was up about 8 cents a gallon, or about 3%, in morning trading.

“I think OPEC is reawakening the inflation monster,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS, which tracks gas prices for AAA. “The White House has to be shocked and major-time pissed. It certainly alters the calculus for a while.”

The national average for US gas prices stood at $3.51, on Monday, according to AAA. Kloza said he could see it getting up to $3.80 to $3.90 in relatively short order thanks to the move by OPEC.

“We’re not going to get back to $5 a gallon. I don’t think we’re even going as high as $4,” he said. But he said by the end of the summer US drivers could be back above year-earlier prices, especially if there is a hurricane or other storms affecting production along the Gulf Coast.

The average US regular gas price a year ago stood at $4.19 a gallon in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the disruption that caused to world’s energy markets. Prices eventually reached a record $5.02 a gallon on June 14, before starting a slow but steady decline over the course of more than three months during which the average price fell every day. The decline was partly driven by the release of oil from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and partly by concerns that there could be a US or global recession that reduced the demand for gasoline.

Even at $3.51, US gas prices were just below the $3.53 average on Feb. 23, 2022, the day before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Kloza said one thing keeping prices from getting anywhere near the record levels of 2022 is that the US plans additional releases from the SPR, and US oil production and refining capacity are both up. But a cut of 1 million barrels a day of oil by OPEC+ will not be easy to make up.

“They have ability to cut production and they seem motivated to do so,” he said.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/energy/gas-prices-opec/index.html,1

Opinion: Why is ‘60 Minutes’ amplifying the views of Marjorie Taylor Greene?,"Editor’s Note: Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio’s daily program “The Dean Obeidallah Show.” Follow him @DeanObeidallah@masto.ai. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.

CNN —

Last year, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia spoke at a white nationalist event organized by Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes that caused Republican leaders to denounce her.

Dean Obeidallah CNN

Last week, Greene’s Twitter account was temporarily suspended by the Elon Musk-headed platform over a tweet with a graphic referring to a “Trans Day of Vengeance,” as she denounced a planned transgender rights rally.

And come Tuesday, Greene has announced plans to protest in New York City when former President Donald Trump is expected to be arraigned on an indictment of more than 30 counts, calling the proceedings against him an “unconstitutional WITCH HUNT!”

But on Sunday, Greene was featured on CBS’ “60 Minutes” in an interview the long-running show promoted on Twitter with the tease: “Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, nicknamed MTG, isn’t afraid to share her opinions, no matter how intense and in-your-face they are. She sits down with Lesley Stahl this Sunday on 60 Minutes.” The images attached to this tweet by “60 Minutes” include Greene and Stahl walking through the US Capitol, taking a stroll outside and Greene showing Stahl something on her phone.

In the segment that aired Sunday night, Stahl noted the congresswoman had moved from the fringe to the GOP’s front row in two years despite a “sharp tongue” and “some pretty radical views” as well as “over the top” comments such as “the Democrats are a party of pedophiles.” Stahl also referred to video of Greene chasing a Parkland, Florida, school shooting survivor, still maintaining that the 2020 election was stolen and failing to criticize Trump over spending. (The interview was conducted before news of his indictment.)

But Stahl didn’t mention Greene spoke at a white nationalist event a year ago while a member of Congress or her extreme anti-Muslim views and her defense of January 6 rioters.

Criticism of CBS for amplifying Greene has been swift and well-deserved even before the program aired. Former GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois tweeted beforehand: “Wow. Insane that 60 min would do this.” (Kinzinger is a CNN senior political commentator.)

Journalist Molly Jong-Fast also slammed “60 Minutes” with the tweet: “Attention is currency and 60 minutes is spending its currency on the Jewish space lasers woman.” (Jong-Fast was apparently referring to Greene’s past claim that a massive California wildfire was started by “a laser” beamed from space controlled by a prominent Jewish banking family.)

David Hogg, who survived the 2018 horrific school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland and has since become an activist against gun violence, responded, “I look forward to your questions about why she thinks school shootings are fake and why she’s supported QAnon.”

Greene amplified the conspiracy theory — two years before being elected to Congress — that the Parkland shooting that took 17 lives was staged. And in 2019, Greene appeared on video confronting Hogg outside the Capitol when he was championing laws to save lives from gun violence, screaming that the then-teenager was a “coward.” She also called Hogg “#littleHitler” on social media.

Greene’s own tweet promoting Sunday’s segment was not filled with her typical smears of “fake news” when she doesn’t like the coverage. Rather, Greene urged people to tune in as she praised “60 Minutes” host Stahl (and misspelled her first name): “It was an honor to spend a few days with the legendary icon Leslie Stahl and talented crew @60Minutes.” Greene added, “Leslie is a trailblazer for women in journalism. And while we may disagree on some issues, I respect her greatly.”

Now, it is true that “60 Minutes” over its 50-plus-year history has featured what the show has dubbed “controversial” guests. These include a 2000 interview with Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, whose 1995 terrorist attack left 168 dead, including 19 children. And the show did a 1979 interview with Iran’s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.

Perhaps “60 Minutes” views Greene — who has repeatedly downplayed and even defended the January 6, 2021, attack plus called for the GOP to become the party of “Christian nationalism” — in the vein of its long list of controversial guests. (CBS had not responded to a request from CNN for comment at time of publishing.)

However, the choice of Greene as a guest instantly recalls the comments of then-CBS CEO Les Moonves during Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign when he admitted that Trump’s candidacy “may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS.” Moonves added, “The money’s rolling in and this is fun. … (T)his is going to be a very good year for us,” concluding, “Sorry. It’s a terrible thing to say. But bring it on, Donald. Keep going.”

Moonves may be gone from CBS, but it appears his mindset continues at “60 Minutes.” And that may be good for “60 Minutes,” but it’s definitely not good for America.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/opinions/60-minutes-marjorie-taylor-greene-interview-obeidallah/index.html,1
‘The New Big 5’: Wildlife photography book turns the lens on animals at risk,"Editor’s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex’s Perpetual Planet initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.

CNN —

Originally a term used by trophy hunters in Africa, the “Big Five” described the animals most challenging to shoot and kill: the lion, elephant, leopard, rhino, and buffalo. Nowadays, it is more loosely used to refer to some of Africa’s largest and most iconic animals.

However, British photographer Graeme Green has reclaimed the narrative, creating a global “New Big Five” for wildlife photography. In 2021, 50,000 people around the world voted for the five animals they would most like to photograph, or see photographed, in the wild. Five animals were crowned the winners: the elephant, polar bear, lion, gorilla and tiger.

This week, sees the publication of “The New Big 5” photography book, which features images of those animals and other at-risk wildlife, from photography legends such as Ami Vitale, Steve McCurry and Paul Nicklen, and essays from famous conservationists and activists including like Jane Goodall and Paula Kahumbu.

Green says that the book celebrates wildlife and is a global call to action on issues impacting wildlife, including habitat loss, poaching, pollution and climate change.

Animals at risk

Green was on assignment in Botswana at least a decade ago when he came up with the idea for a project to encourage people to “shoot with a camera, not a gun,” he says.

“I thought this would be a way to get people really focusing on wildlife, thinking about the wildlife they love, thinking about the animals that are at risk.”

In total, the book includes the work of 144 globally renowned wildlife photographers from Ecuador to India. Curating the images took nearly two years of work, says Green.

“I think these are some of the most beautiful and creative images that I’ve seen put together in one book,” says Green. “These are the species that we are at risk of losing.”

According to the UN, nature is declining at an unprecedented rate, with around one million of the planet’s animal and plant species facing extinction. The “New Big 5,” all of which are threatened, act as ambassadors for what is happening in the natural world, says Green.

As well as being a powerful reminder of what we stand to lose, the book also points people towards potential solutions. Featured essays explore the benefits of rewilding and the importance of indigenous communities in conservation.

A chapter on endangered species from bees to blue whales illustrates the alarming threat climate change poses to animals outside of the “New Big 5.” “That’s only the tip of the iceberg – I could have included thousands of pictures because that’s how serious the situation is,” says Green.

""In Indian forests, it's very difficult to get a proper picture of a running tiger, as they all are thick forests. I kept the camera settings fast enough to freeze the running tiger,"" said photographer Thomas Vijayan in a press release. Thomas Vijayan/The New Big 5

Jane Goodall, a leading conservationist who also wrote the afterword to the book, said in a press release that “we have a window of time during which we can start to heal some of the harm we have inflicted on the natural world, but only if we get together and take action now.

“I hope the photos will lead people into the wonderful worlds of these iconic species. Then, perhaps, other people will become involved in helping to create a world where wildlife can flourish for future generations to enjoy,” she said.

"Syrian refugee elected mayor of German town, years after fleeing war","CNN —

A Syrian who arrived in Germany as a refugee in 2015 has won a mayoral election in the southwestern German state of Baden-Württemberg.

Ryyan Alshebl, who left his hometown of As Suwayda in Syria eight years ago, ran as an independent in the municipality of Ostelsheim. He won 55.41% of the votes on Sunday, beating two German candidates, Marco Strauss and Mathias Fey.

Locals cheered the 29-year-old when he welcomed his win, a victory he described as “sensational,” German local broadcaster SWR reported Monday.

“Today, Ostelsheim sent an example for broad-mindedness and cosmopolitanism for the whole of Germany,” he said, according to to German public broadcaster ZDF. “That’s not something that can be taken for granted in a conservative, rural area.”

Alshebl’s first call after his victory was to his mother in Syria, who was thrilled with the news, SWR reported.

The Association of Municipalities of Baden-Württemberg said Alshebl is the first man with Syrian roots to run for and win a mayor’s office. He will start his role in June.

Ostelsheim residents have welcomed their incoming mayor. “The fairy tale has come true, and the right man has become our mayor,” Annette Keck, who lives in the village, told SWR.

Strauss, one of his opponents, congratulated Alshebl. “I wish you good luck and at the same time ask for support for Mr. Alshebl, for our shared Ostelsheim,” he said on Facebook.

The state’s Integration Minister Manne Lucha said that Alshebl’s victory showed that diversity is a natural part of Baden-Württemberg. “I would be very pleased if Ryyan Alshebl’s election encourages more people with a migration history to run for political office,” he said.

Not everyone has been so warm to the 29-year-old. ZDF reported the Syrian received hateful comments on the campaign trail.

The young politician went from house to house, promoting his election program, and “the experiences were predominantly positive,” but there was also a minority of far-right fringe voters in Ostelsheim that did not want to accept him due to his Syrian roots, Alshebl told ZDF.

‘Investing in your future’

Born to a schoolteacher and agricultural engineer in Syria, Alshebl described his life as carefree until the age of 20, according to his campaign website.

At the time, protests against the Syrian government that began in 2011 soon devolved into chaotic war. The fighting and later rise of ISIS forced 10.6 million people from home by late 2015 – about half of Syria’s pre-war population.

Alshebl faced the dilemma of being drafted for military service with the Syrian army or leaving the country, according to his website.

While many Syrians were displaced internally or fled to countries in the region, others like Alshebl made the dangerous journey to Europe. He was 21 years old at the time, and said he crossed from Turkey to the Greek island of Lesbos in a rubber dinghy.

Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel had implemented a brief open-door policy in 2015 that saw the country take in about 1.2 million asylum seekers in the following years, including Alshebl.

The move sparked a backlash in Germany and the sudden growth of the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) in the wake of summer 2015.

Once in Germany, Alshebl lived close to Ostelsheim and said at the time he felt “there is only one thing you can do: get back on your feet quickly and start investing in your own future quickly.”

For the last seven years he worked in the administration of Althengstett town hall, in a neighboring town. He drew from his experience, he said in his campaign, and made digital access to to public administration services one of priorities. Flexible childcare and climate protections are also on his agenda.

Alshebl, who is a member of the Green Party and now has German citizenship, pledged during his campaign that once elected as mayor he would move to Ostelsheim.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/04/europe/germany-mayor-syrian-refugee-intl/index.html,1
"Autism: Study finds slightly higher risk of diagnosis in areas with more lithium in drinking water, but experts say more research is needed","CNN —

A new study found a moderately higher risk of autism spectrum disorder in children born to pregnant people exposed to tap water with higher levels of lithium, but experts caution that this association does not show a direct link between the two.

About 1 in 36 children in the US is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) each year, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Scientists still don’t know the exact cause of autism, a developmental disorder. Genetics may be a factor, but some have been looking at potential environmental causes, too.

Cases may be on the rise, but that is also unclear. One study published this year on cases in the New York-New Jersey area found that autism diagnosis rates tripled among certain age groups between 2000 and 2016. A 2021 report found similar increases in cases, but the CDC says the increased number of cases is most likely linked to more doctors screening for the condition.

Lithium is an alkali metal that can be found naturally in some food and ground water. It’s used in batteries, grease and air conditioners, as well as in the treatment of bipolar disorder and some blood disorders. Its levels in US drinking water are not regulated, according to the US Geological Survey.

A new study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, found a small association between lithium and autism diagnosis in Denmark, where the researchers say the level of lithium in drinking water is similar to that in American water systems.

The researchers checked a database of people with psychiatric disorders for children born between 2000 and 2013 to find information on 8,842 cases of ASD and 43,864 participants who did not have ASD. They then measured the concentration of lithium in 151 public waterworks that served more than half of the Danish population and mapped out where pregnant people lived in relation.

As lithium levels in water increased, there was a modest increased risk of an ASD diagnosis. Specifically, compared with people at the lowest exposure level, those who had the second and third highest exposure during pregnancy had a 24% to 26% higher risk of ASD diagnosed in children. The group with the highest exposure had a 46% higher risk than those at the lowest level of exposure.

The researchers could not tell how much water the pregnant people drank, but they picked Denmark in part because residents there consume some of the lowest amounts of bottled water in Europe.

Experts say it’s important to note that the research can’t show that lithium exposure leads directly to an autism diagnosis.

Further study is required, said study co-author Dr. Beate Ritz, a professor of neurology in the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, and a professor of epidemiology and environmental health at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.

“Any drinking water contaminants that may affect the developing human brain deserve intense scrutiny,” Ritz said in a news release. She added that the research would need to be replicated in other countries to look for a similar connection.

The implications of the findings are complex as far as public health policy is concerned, according to an editorial published alongside the study. Lithium levels in water, at concentrations that the study associated with a potential ASD risk, have also been linked with health benefits such as lower rates of hospitalization for psychiatric disorders and suicide.

“If all these of associations are valid, the wisdom of Solomon will be required to develop guidelines for lithium in drinking water that are maximally protective of the entire population,” wrote Dr. David C. Bellinger, a professor of neurology and psychology at Harvard Medical School. “Until the basic biology of ASD is better understood, it will be difficult to distinguish causal from spurious associations.”

Dr. Max Wiznitzer, director of the Rainbow Autism Center at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, points to other research on the effects of lithium on pregnant people who take it for mental health disorders. Those studies – which look at people exposed to much higher levels than are found in drinking water – do not show a connection with autism spectrum disorder.

“It’s an interesting association, but causation is definitely not proven,” said Wiznitzer, who was not involved in the new research. “We have to see if there’s a viable and biologically plausible mechanism by which a small amount of lithium in the water supply can somehow do this, yet pharmacologic dosing of lithium in women with bipolar disorder has not been reported to be causing increased risk of ASD.”

Other studies have also suggested connections between ASD and environmental exposures to things like pesticides, air pollution and phthalates. But none of them points to any of these factors as a direct cause of the disorder.

A link between environmental exposure and ASD is hard to prove, Wiznitzer said. With research showing that increased exposure to air pollution raises the risk of giving birth to a child with ASD, for example, he often wonders whether pollution is the determining factor or if it’s just the populations who live in more polluted areas.

“There’s a lot of speculation about about environmental factors, but how many of them are truly causally associated?” Wiznitzer said. “We are bombarded with a variety of environmental stressors in our everyday lives. We have to figure out how to basically safely navigate them, and this is probably not one that’s high on our list.”",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/health/autism-lithium-study/index.html,1
"Kwame Brathwaite, photographer of ‘Black is Beautiful’ movement, dies at 85","Editor’s Note: This article was originally published by The Art Newspaper, an editorial partner of CNN Style.

CNN —

Kwame Brathwaite, the pioneering activist and photographer whose work helped define the aesthetics of the “Black is Beautiful” movement of the 1960s and beyond, died on April 1, aged 85.

His son, Kwame Brathwaite, Jr, announced his father’s death in an Instagram post that read in part, “I am deeply saddened to share that my Baba, the patriarch of our family, our rock and my hero has transitioned.”

Brathwaite’s work has been the subject of resurgent interest from curators, historians and collectors in recent years, and his first major institutional retrospective, which was organized by the Aperture Foundation, made its debut in 2019 at the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles before touring the country.

Kwame Brathwaite Cory Rice

Brathwaite was born in 1938 to Barbadian immigrants, in what he referred to as “the People’s Republic of Brooklyn” in New York, though his family moved from there to Harlem and then to the South Bronx when Brathwaite was 5 years old. He attended the School of Industrial Art (now the High School of Art and Design) and, according to profiles of Brathwaite in T Magazine and Vice, was drawn to photography by two moments. The first was in August of 1955, when a 17-year-old Brathwaite encountered David Jackson’s haunting photograph of a brutalized Emmett Till in his open casket. The second was in 1956, when — after he and his brother Elombe co-founded the African Jazz Arts Society and Studios (AJASS) — Brathwaite saw a young man taking photos in a dark jazz club without the use of a flash, and his mind became alight with possibility.

Using a Hasselblad medium-format camera, Brathwaite attempted to do the same, learning to work with limited light in a manner that enhanced the visual narrative of his imagery. He would soon also develop a darkroom technique that enriched and deepened how Black skin would appear in his photography, honing the practice in a small darkroom in his Harlem apartment. Brathwaite went on to photograph jazz legends performing throughout the 1950s and ’60s, including Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk and others.

“You want to get the feeling, the mood that you’re experiencing when they’re playing,” Brathwaite told Aperture Magazine in 2017. “That’s the thing. You want to capture that.”

By the early 1960s, alongside the rest of AJASS, Brathwaite began using his photography and organizing prowess to consciously push back against whitewashed, Eurocentric beauty standards. The group came up with the concept of the Grandassa Models, young Black women whom Brathwaite would photograph, celebrating and accentuating their features. In 1962, AJASS organized “Naturally ’62”, a fashion show held in a Harlem club called the Purple Manor and featuring the models. The show would go on to be held regularly until 1992. In 1966, Brathwaite married his wife Sikolo, a Grandassa Model whom he had met on the street the year prior when he asked if he could take her portrait. The two remained married for the rest of Brathwaite’s life.

By the 1970s, Brathwaite’s focus on jazz shifted to other forms of popular Black music. In 1974, he traveled to Africa with the Jackson Five to document their tour, also photographing the historic “Rumble in the Jungle” boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in what’s now the Democratic Republic of Congo that same year. Commissions in this era also saw Brathwaite photographing Nina Simone, Stevie Wonder, Sly and the Family Stone, Bob Marley and other music legends.

Throughout the ensuing decades, Brathwaite continued to explore and develop his mode of photography, all through the lens of the “Black is Beautiful” ethos. In 2016, Brathwaite joined the roster of Philip Martin Gallery in Los Angeles, and he was continuing to photograph commissions as recently as 2018, when he shot artist and stylist Joanne Petit-Frère for The New Yorker.

T Magazine’s 2021 profile, published on the occasion of Brathwaite’s retrospective traveling to the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Texas, noted that the photographer’s health was failing such that he was unable to be interviewed for the article. A separate exhibition, “Kwame Brathwaite: Things Well Worth Waiting For,” is currently on view at the Art Institute of Chicago, where it will remain until July 24.

Inside haggis: The secrets of Scotland’s national dish,"CNN —

Anthony Bourdain loved haggis. But even the late, great American chef, writer and television host recognized that Scotland’s national dish, with its “sinister sheep parts” wrapped in a shroud of mystery and half-invented history, could be a hard sell.

“Don’t let them tell you otherwise, that’s really one of life’s great pleasures,” Bourdain said on one of his gastro-curious pilgrimages to Glasgow. “There is no more unfairly reviled food on Earth than the haggis.”

A mash-up of diced lung, liver and heart mixed with oatmeal, beef suet, onion and assorted spices, haggis was traditionally made by stuffing these raw ingredients into the stomach of a recently slain sheep and boiling the lot to a state of palatability.

Instagrammable is not the word that immediately comes to mind. In our 21st-century world, where “clean” eating and processed pap overlap, haggis can seem like an “Outlander”-style outlier from another age.

Yet, by some alchemy, once cooked to its required “warm-reekin’ (steaming)” state, it adds up to much more than the sum of its modest parts. It’s offaly charm has kept nose-to-tail eating alive among a younger generation of Scots that has largely turned its back on the tripe, liver and kidneys their predecessors enjoyed (or endured).

Carefully prepared, haggis tastes both oaty and meaty; it is dark and crumbly, a little crispy at the edges but still moist; earthy but also savory and spicy; deep-tasting and profoundly warming, the perfect foil for its traditional garnish of floury mashed potatoes and orange bashed turnip.

“It’s like a cuddle for the stomach,” says Nicola Turner, a 35-year-old office administrator from Helensburgh, a town on western Scotland’s Firth of Clyde.

Spice and texture

For children of the 1960s and ’70s, like crime novelist Ian Rankin, haggis meals were a choice between the classic meat-and-two-veg plate and the battered and deep-fried, chip-shop iteration loved by both his friend Bourdain and his quintessentially Scottish detective character, Inspector John Rebus.

Now myriad other treatments have blossomed.

“I’m pretty sure the first time I dined with AB in Edinburgh we had haggis in filo pastry with a jam-style – maybe blackcurrant – sauce,” Rankin recalled. “He was a big fan of haggis and of chip shops. Rebus will have enjoyed the occasional haggis supper from his local chip shop. He was definitely a fan, as am I.”

“It is all about the spicing and the texture,” says the Scottish food writer, novelist and cook Sue Lawrence, a champion of haggis’ adaptability for use in other dishes. “If you didn’t know what was in it, you wouldn’t think ‘oh that tastes of liver or whatever.’ It is all nicely chopped up and the oatmeal gives it a lovely texture. It could easily be a nice, big mince dish.”

Lawrence uses haggis as an alternative to beef and pork ragù in lasagna and in her pastilla, a version of the North African dish in which a hand-made haggis from the Isle of Mull substitutes for the traditional poultry or seafood filling. The filo pastry savory is flavored with the spice blend ras el hanout, apricots, chile, orange zest and almonds before being sprinkled with cinnamon and icing sugar.

Such cultural crossovers serve as a reminder that haggis could easily be a dish with nothing specifically Scottish about it at all. Records of similar quick and portable preparations of the fast-perishing innards of sheep and other animals date back to ancient Rome and Greece.

Haggis-like combinations of offal and grains are part of the culinary history of several countries. Spain has chireta, Romania drob and Sweden polsa, while chaudin, or ponce, is a rice and meat-stuffed pig stomach that is a staple of Cajun cooking.

In neighboring England, recipes for “hagese,” “hagws of a schepe,” “haggas” or “haggus” pop up in recipe books published between the 15th and 17th centuries, probably preceding written records north of the border.

Etymological evidence points to the term “haggis” having its roots in Old Norse, suggesting an early version of an oat-and-offal sausage might have arrived in Britain and Ireland on a Viking longboat.

But ever since it was first optioned by the poet Robert Burns in the late 1700s, the haggis backstory has been monopolized by Scotland and the Scots, sometimes mischievously.

It is, according to the kind of lore that Burns engendered, the dish a doughty Highlander would carry with him as he drove cattle through the glens to the markets of the central belt or the perfect picnic for a whisky smuggler plying his illicit trade by moonlight.

From such romantic notions it was a short step to turning the haggis into a wee wild beastie, one with longer legs on one side that was thus condemned to run round and round whichever hill it lived on. In 2003, a poll of American tourists in Scotland found that one in three of them believed they might encounter such a confused creature on a Caledonian vacation.

Bourdain, a native New Yorker, may have qualified as haggis’ biggest admirer since Burns, but his compatriots at the US Department of Agriculture remain unconverted to offal-filled paunch. Haggis imports into the United States were prohibited in 1971 as part of a ban on the consumption of all livestock lungs. Authentic versions of old school haggis remain culinary contraband in the US, as hard to lay your hands on as Cuban cigars.

Across the rest of the world, it’s a different story. According to leading producer Simon Howie, haggis is more widely appreciated and consumed now than it has been since Burns improvised his “Address to a Haggis” for the entertainment of well-to-do Edinburgh acquaintances.

Pudding chieftan

Firmly tongue-in-cheek, the poem lauds the “Great chieftain o’ the pudding race,” as exactly the kind of unpretentious, hearty fare required to nourish a nation of braveheart warriors.

In comparison to the enfeebling foreign muck enjoyed by the capital’s claret-quaffing elites of the time – the olio, fricassée or ragoût that would “sicken a sow” – Burns urges his readers to wonder at the magical impact of haggis on his fellow sons of Scotland’s soil.

As the English translation of the original Scots language version puts it:

But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed/

The trembling earth resounds his tread/

Clap in his ample fist a blade/

He’ll make it whistle/

And legs and arms and heads will cut/

Off like the heads of thistles

These days synthetic casings have largely replaced stomach but ovine and porcine innards remain at the core of most of the haggis produced in its homeland, said Howie, who estimates that his company Simon Howie Butchers, accounts for around 60% of the roughly two million haggises produced every year.

For Howie, versatility, value for money and convenience explain why this staple of the Scottish larder is thriving. Typically haggis retails in Scotland, which accounts for half of global consumption by volume, for around £6, or $7.70 per kilogram ($3.36/pound). That’s around half the price of less expensive cuts of beef or a third of the price of Scotch lamb while enjoying a fairly similar nutritional and calorific profile.

“You can give your kids a meal that is not full of things you don’t want to feed them – for a few pounds you can feed three strapping lads,” Howie said.

“From a kitchen perspective, it is very simple because when it leaves our factory it is already cooked. So when you or a restaurant owner gets it into the kitchen all you have to do is heat it up to be piping hot. It couldn’t be more basic: a student with no cooking skills or a Michelin-starred chef do exactly the same thing to put it out on the plate.”

Haggis pakora

Its texture means haggis can also be usefully deployed in fine dining alongside leaner meat like venison or as a stuffing for poultry and game birds. Its spicy intensity means it is also finding uses in canapés and as a crouton-borne garnish for soups.

Buoyant sales are also underpinned by the increasing consumption of haggis in forms inspired by Scotland’s ethnic minorities.

Glasgow’s Sikh community pioneered haggis pakora in the 1990s and samosas, spring rolls and quesadillas have followed in its wake, often using a vegetarian version of the protein in which the offal is replaced by a mix of vegetables, pulses and mushrooms.

Such dishes are more than culinary twists. They are badges of belonging, and an indication that, two centuries after Burns grabbed it for the nation, haggis is as intimately entwined with Scots identity as ever.

Just ask Ross O’Cinneide, a promising 14-year-old fly-half in the junior section of Stirling County rugby club.

“Most of my friends and I like haggis,” he says. “Mum makes it for us sometimes after rugby and it’s got a very nice warming feeling. And it’s nice because it’s purely Scottish.”",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/haggis-scotland-secrets/index.html,1
Elon Musk’s Twitter promised a purge of blue check marks. Instead he singled out one account,"New York CNN —

Some VIP Twitter users woke up on Saturday expecting to have lost their coveted blue verification check marks in a previously announced purge by Elon Musk. Instead, Twitter appeared to target a single account from a major publication Musk dislikes and changed the language on its site in a way that obscures why users are verified.

Twitter had said it would “begin winding down” blue checks granted under its old verification system — which emphasized protecting high-profile users at risk of impersonation — on April 1. In order to stay verified, Musk said, users would have to pay $8 per month to join the platform’s Twitter Blue subscription service, which has allowed accounts to pay for verification since December.

Most legacy blue check holders found this weekend that their verification marks had not disappeared, but rather had been appended with a new label reading: “This account is verified because it’s subscribed to Twitter Blue or is a legacy verified account.” The language, which shows up when users click on the check mark, makes it unclear whether verified accounts are actually notable individuals or simply users who have paid to join Twitter Blue.

But one high-profile account did lose its blue check over the weekend: the main account for the New York Times, which had previously told CNN it would not pay for verification.

After an account that often engages with Musk posted a meme this weekend about the Times declining to pay for verification, Musk responded in a tweet saying, “Oh ok, we’ll take it off then.” Musk then lashed out at the Times — just the latest instance of the billionaire slamming journalists or media outlets — in a series of tweets that claimed the outlet’s coverage is boring and “propaganda.”

The weekend moves are just the latest example of Twitter creating confusion and whiplash for users over feature changes — and in this case, not just any users, but many of the most high-profile accounts that have long been a key selling point for the platform. It also highlights how Musk often appears to guide decisions about the platform more by whims than by policy.

Although the New York Times’ main account lost its blue check, its other accounts, such as those for its arts, travel and books content, remained verified. (It’s not clear why the New York Times doesn’t have a gold “organizations” check mark, like accounts for other news outlets, including the Associated Press and the Washington Post.) After its blue check was removed, a spokesperson for the New York Times reiterated to CNN that it does not plan to pay for verification.

Twitter, which laid off most of its public relations staff last fall, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In a separate puzzling move, Twitter’s blue bird logo at the top of the site was replaced on Monday with doge, the meme representing the cryptocurrency dogecoin, which Musk has promoted. The price of dogecoin shot up 20% on Monday.

Musk’s long campaign against “legacy” blue checks

Musk has been threatening to take away “legacy” blue check marks from users verified under Twitter’s old system since shortly after he bought Twitter last fall.

In early November, Twitter launched the option for people paying for its Twitter Blue subscription service to receive blue checks. The program was quickly put on pause after being plagued by a wave of celebrity and corporate impersonators, and was relaunched in December.

Twitter also rolled out a color-coded verification system with differently colored marks for companies and government entities, but Musk continued to say that individual users would eventually have to pay for blue checks.

In the days leading up to the blue check purge that wasn’t, prominent users such as actor William Shatner and anti-bullying activist Monica Lewinksy pushed back against the idea that, as power users that draw attention to the site, they should have to pay for a feature that keeps them safe from impersonation.

By muddying the reason accounts are verified, the new label could risk making it easier for people to scam or impersonate high-profile users. Experts in inauthentic behavior have also said it’s not clear that reserving verification for paid users will reduce the number of bots on the site, an issue Musk has raised on and off over the past year.

Musk, for his part, has previously presented changes to Twitter’s verification system as a way of “treating everyone equally.”

“There shouldn’t be a different standard for celebrities,” he said in a tweet last week. The paid feature could also drive revenue, which could help Musk, who is on the hook for significant debt after buying Twitter for $44 billion.

Musk last week also said that starting on April 15, only verified accounts would be recommended in users’ “For You” feeds alongside the accounts they follow.

Emma Heming Willis shares family photos as daughter Mabel turns 11,"CNN —

Bruce Willis’ wife, Emma Heming Willis, has celebrated their elder daughter’s birthday with a trip down memory lane.

Mabel Willis turned 11 on Sunday, and her proud mom marked the occasion by sharing a montage of family photos and videos taken over the years, set to the song “Pictures Of You” by The Cure.

“Happy 11th Birthday Mabel Ray!” Heming Willis wrote in the caption.

“Your energy is infectious,” she continued, praising her little girl for the way she “can light a whole room with your smile and warmth.”

“How you love and care for your family and friends is beautiful to witness. Keep shining my love and always remember to #liveitup,” Heming Willis added.

Heming Willis and Willis married in 2009. Along with Mabel, the couple also have an 8-year-old daughter, Evelyn. Willis also has daughters Rumer, Scout and Tallulah with his ex-wife, Demi Moore.

Willis is clearly a doting dad. One picture in Heming Willis’ montage shows the “Die Hard” star holding baby Mabel while planting a kiss on her forehead, while a more recent image shows a beaming Willis hanging out in nature with his preteen.

Heming Willis penned an equally heartfelt tribute last month when her husband celebrated his 68th birthday. Sharing a video montage on Instagram, she referred to the actor as “pure love.”

In February, Willis’ family announced that his speaking disorder, aphasia, had progressed into a form of dementia called frontotemporal dementia, or FTD.

“Today there are no treatments for the disease, a reality that we hope can change in the years ahead,” they said in an update shared online. “As Bruce’s condition advances, we hope that any media attention can be focused on shining a light on this disease that needs far more awareness and research.”

According to the Alzheimer’s Association, FTD refers to “a group of disorders caused by progressive nerve cell loss in the brain’s frontal lobes (the areas behind your forehead) or its temporal lobes.” These areas of the brain are generally associated with personality, behavior and language.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/entertainment/emma-willis-mabel-birthday-photos-intl-scli/index.html,1
Lionel Messi: Some fans whistle as Messi’s name is announced as Paris Saint-Germain’s season hits new low,"CNN —

Paris Saint-Germain’s miserable season went from bad to worse on Sunday as the team suffered a second straight home defeat with a 1-0 loss to Lyon.

Even before the game kicked off, Lionel Messi bore the brunt of the frustrations of some PSG fans who whistled when his name appeared on the big screen during the announcement of the starting lineup.

After Alexadre Lacazette missed a first-half penalty, Bradley Barcola’s goal 10 minutes into the second period was enough to earn Lyon the three points on a night that PSG rarely looked like threatening the visiting goal.

Lens’ 1-0 victory over Rennes and Marseille’s 1-1 draw with Montepellier means both teams are now just six points behind PSG at the top of Ligue 1, and even the domestic title may slip from the team’s grasp.

The reaction of some fans on Sunday must have felt a world away from the adulation and worship Messi received during his recent return to Argentina for friendlies against Panama and Curaçao as the country continued its World Cup celebrations.

Messi’s arrival at the Parc des Princes was supposed to be the missing piece that would help PSG finally win the Champions League, the trophy the club’s Qatari owners crave the most.

So far, the only major trophy the team has won since Messi joined was Ligue 1 last season, a title – it’s fair to say – PSG would likely have won without him.

Messi has 34 goal contributions in all competitions for PSG this season – 18 goals and 17 assists – second only to Mbappé’s 38 and head coach Christophe Galtier refused to lay the blame for the team’s failures at the Argentine’s feet.

“I found it [the jeering] hard to listen to,” Galtier told reporters, per the Athletic. “There may be expectations for Messi and Mbappe to unlock difficult situations. Messi tries very hard, they didn’t all work out; but around him, the other players also need to do their jobs.”

“We can’t expect everything from Leo and Kylian,” he added.

Up next for PSG is a season-defining week as Galtier’s side travels to a Nice team that is unbeaten in 13 matches, before hosting Lens at the Parc des Princes.

PSG has lost two of its three matches since being dumped out of the Champions League by Bayern Munich last month, and only limped past relegation-threatened Brest with a 90th minute Kylian Mbappé winner.

After his team’s victory, Lyon head coach Laurent Blanc said the Champions League or bust mentality has been detrimental to PSG’s performances.

“Paris’ problem is when the No. 1 objective of the Champions League is no longer accessible, it seems that the season no longer exists – and at all levels,” he told reporters.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/football/lionel-messi-psg-whistles-fans-spt-intl/index.html,1
Graham Potter: Premier League breaks record for most sackings in a single season,"CNN —

It was just six months ago that Graham Potter was deemed the man to usher in a fresh, exciting era at Chelsea.

The club’s new ownership group, led by American businessman Todd Boehly, had enticed Potter away from Brighton with the promise of managing one of the most lucrative teams in world soccer.

More than $600 million was spent on bringing big-name players to the club and Potter, one of the most exciting young managers in the Premier League, was to mold them into a winning machine.

But, on Sunday, the club announced that it had sacked its manager after an underwhelming spell in charge.

Potter managed to win just 10 of the 28 league matches this season and leaves the team 11th in the Premier League table.

In recent weeks, players had looked a shadow of their former selves and many fans had lost confidence that Potter’s plan for the club could ever work.

Eventually, after previously sticking by its manager, Blues ownership agreed.

“On behalf of everyone at the club, we want to thank Graham sincerely for his contribution to Chelsea,” the club’s co-owners Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali said in a statement.

“We have the highest degree of respect for Graham as a coach and as a person. He has always conducted himself with professionalism and integrity and we are all disappointed in this outcome.”

In his previous role as Brighton manager, Potter was given time to stamp his identity on the squad.

The club was punching above its weight financially and, as a result, carefully selected new signings which would compliment Potter’s style of play.

The approach paid off as the team became an established Premier League outfit which has gone on to greater things this season – the Seagulls currently sit sixth in the league and in the UEFA Conference League qualification spot.

At Chelsea, it seemed the complete opposite.

As was the case under previous owner Roman Abramovich, the club expected instant results and used its financial weight to sign a number of high-profile names, including the likes of Enzo Fernández and Mykhailo Mudryk.

Despite his impressive CV, Potter had never managed superstars and suddenly found himself in a changing room with multiple.

The scatter gun approach to recruitment also left the team lacking balance and organization with Potter failing to get a tune out of a team busting with talent.

Premier League record

In truth, many had raised an eyebrow when Potter, inexperienced at the very top level, was chosen to replace Thomas Tuchel as manager.

Despite falling out of favor with fans by the end of his tenure, Tuchel had guided Chelsea to the Champions League title in 2021 and is still considered by many as one of the best coaches in the world.

The German has gone on to sign with Bavarian giant Bayern Munich through the 2024/25 season and recently told reporters he needed “quite a bit of time to distance himself from Chelsea” because leaving the club had hurt him.

“Todd [Boehly] said he would be different to Roman [Abramovich],” former Liverpool player and current pundit Jamie Carragher wrote on Twitter.

“I feel for Graham Potter, but it was inevitable. You don’t change Tuchel for Potter. Ridiculous decision to start with.”

With 10 games left in the league and a Champions League quarterfinal against Real Madrid on the horizon, Chelsea still has plenty to play for.

Assistant coach Bruno Saltor will take over on an interim basis, but Boehly and his team must now look for a long-term replacement capable – and willing – to bring order to Chelsea’s chaos.

Potter’s sacking is yet another sign of just how transient managers can be in the top-flight of English football, especially when results aren’t instantaneous.

There has now been a record 12 sackings in the Premier League so far this season, with Potter leaving his position the same day Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers was sacked from his.

The previous record was 10 manager changes in a single season, set in four other campaigns, most recently in 2017/18.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/football/chelsea-graham-potter-manager-premier-league-spt-intl/index.html,1

Angel Reese defends gesture directed towards Caitlin Clark after LSU national title win; calls out double standard after being ‘unapologetically’ her,"CNN —

LSU star Angel Reese defended the gesture she aimed at Iowa Hawkeyes’ Caitlin Clark near the end of the Tigers’ first NCAA women’s basketball national championship victory on Sunday, saying “I don’t take disrespect lightly.”

Reese could be seen approaching Clark before moving her open hand in front of her face – popularized by WWE star John Cena to mean “you can’t see me” – before pointing to her ring finger in a gesture some interpreted as a reference to the place her newly-acquired championship ring might sit.

Clark made a similar gesture to another player earlier in the tournament.

The gesture has sparked much debate, especially on social media. Some have criticized Reese, while others have defended her actions, highlighting how there was no public outrage in response to Clark’s gesture earlier in the tournament.

Sports journalist Jose de Jesus Ortiz called Reese’s actions “classless,” while former ESPN host Keith Olbermann called Reese an “idiot” for the gesture.

In the press conference after the victory, Reese referenced the difference in reaction she received as a result of her gesture as compared to the one Clark received.

“All year, I was critiqued for who I was. I don’t fit the narrative,” Reese said. “I don’t fit the box that y’all want me to be in. I’m too hood. I’m too ghetto. Y’all told me that all year. But when other people do it, and y’all don’t say nothing.

“So this is for the girls that look like me. For those that want to speak up for what they believe in. It’s unapologetically you. And that’s what I did it for tonight. It was bigger than me tonight. And Twitter is going to go into a rage every time.

“And I’m happy. I feel like I’ve helped grow women’s basketball this year. (…) I’m looking forward to celebrating and then next season.”

Reese had 15 points and 10 rebounds in the 102-85 victory and won the women’s March Madness’ Most Outstanding Player award.

In the post-game broadcast, Reese referenced the similar gesture Clark made to a Louisville opponent in the Elite Eight.

In the same game, Clark said to an opponent: “You’re down by 15 points. Shut up,” according to the Bleacher Report.

“Caitlin Clark is a hell of a player but I don’t take disrespect lightly,” Reese said. “She disrespected [LSU’s] Alexis [Morris] (…) and I wanted to pick her pocket. But I had a moment at the end of her game. I was in my bag, I was in my moment.”

After the Championship game, Clark herself said she didn’t notice anything at the time.

“I was just trying to get to the handshake line and shake hands and be grateful that my team was in that position,” Clark said in the post-game press conference. “All the credit in the world to LSU. They were tremendous. They deserve it. They had a tremendous season.

“(LSU head coach) Kim Mulkey coached them so, so well. She’s one of the best basketball coaches of all time, and it shows. She only said really kind things to me in the handshake line, so I’m very grateful of that too.

“But honestly I have no idea. I was just trying to spend the last few moments on the court with especially the five people that I’ve started 93 games with and relishing every second of that.”

LSU head coach Mulkey said she had “no clue” about what transpired.

Among those defending Reese on social media were ESPN’s Holly Rowe and former NBA star Etan Thomas.

“People hating on Angel Reese or Caitlin Clark. Stop. Unapologetically confident young women should be celebrated NOT hated. Get used to it,” Rowe wrote on Twitter.

Former Washington Wizards, Oklahoma City Thunder and Atlanta Hawks player Thomas wrote: “Hold on now!!!! It was cute when Caitlin Clark did it. Y’all didn’t have any issues with it at all. So don’t be all outraged and talking about class and sportsmanship when Angel Reese does the same thing. We’re not doing double standards here.”

Reese said the negative reaction on social media throughout the season has helped fuel her excellent season, having finished averaging 23.0 points and 15.4 rebounds in her first season with LSU after transferring from Maryland.

Summer McIntosh: Canadian teenager breaks another world record,"CNN —

Sixteen-year-old Summer McIntosh broke the world record for the 400m individual medley at the Canadian swimming trials on Saturday – just days after breaking the world record for the 400m freestyle.

McIntosh finished the 400m individual medley in a time of 4:25.87, breaking the mark set at the 2016 Rio Olympics by Hungarian swimmer Katinka Hosszú with a time of 4:26.36.

The result continues the teenager’s brilliant week after she broke the 400m freestyle world record last Tuesday – breaking defending Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus’ previous record of 3:56.40, which was set last May, in a time of 3:56.08.

Speaking after her latest triumph, McIntosh shared her emotions.

“That’s the first time I really vividly heard the crowd during my race,” McIntosh said, per Reuters.

“It’s amazing to have all my family and friends in the stands, cheering me on. It really helped me in the last 100 meters.”

The Canadian teen made her Olympic debut aged 14 at Tokyo 2020, where she finished fourth in the 200-meter freestyle.

She bagged gold in the 200m butterfly and 400m medley at the world championships in 2022, as well as two golds at the Commonwealth Games in the 200m and 400m medleys.

The haunting Masters meltdown that changed Rory McIlroy’s career,"Editor’s Note: This story was originally published in April 2023.

CNN —

Slumped on his club, head buried in his arm, Rory McIlroy looked on the verge of tears.

The then-21-year-old had just watched his ball sink into the waters of Rae’s Creek at Augusta National and with it, his dream of winning The Masters, a dream that had looked so tantalizingly close mere hours earlier.

As a four-time major winner and one of the most decorated names in the sport’s history, few players would turn down the chance to swap places with McIlroy heading into Augusta this week.

Yet on Sunday afternoon of April 10, 2011, not a golfer in the world would have wished to be in the Northern Irishman’s shoes.

Flying

A fresh-faced, mop-headed McIlroy had touched down in Georgia for the first major of the season with a reputation as the leading light of the next generation of stars.

An excellent 2010 had marked his best season since turning pro three years earlier, highlighted by a first PGA Tour win at the Quail Hollow Championship and a crucial contribution to Team Europe’s triumph at the Ryder Cup.

Yet despite a pair of impressive top-three finishes at the Open and PGA Championship respectively, a disappointing missed cut at The Masters – his first at a major – served as ominous foreshadowing.

McIlroy shot 74 and 77 to fall four strokes short of the cut line at seven-over par, a performance that concerned him enough to take a brief sabbatical from competition.

But one year on in 2011, any lingering Masters demons looked to have been exorcised as McIlroy flew round the Augusta fairways.

Having opened with a bogey-free seven-under 65 – the first time he had ever shot in the 60s at the major – McIlroy pulled ahead from Spanish first round co-leader Alvaro Quirós with a second round 69.

It sent him into the weekend holding a two-shot cushion over Australia’s Jason Day, with Tiger Woods a further stroke behind and back in the hunt for a 15th major after a surging second round 66.

And yet the 21-year-old leader looked perfectly at ease with having a target on his back. Even after a tentative start to the third round, McIlroy rallied with three birdies across the closing six holes to stretch his lead to four strokes heading into Sunday.

The youngster was out on his own ahead of a bunched chasing pack comprising Day, Ángel Cabrera, K.J. Choi and Charl Schwartzel. After 54 holes, McIlroy had shot just three bogeys.

“It’s a great position to be in … I’m finally feeling comfortable on this golf course,” McIlroy told reporters.

“I’m not getting ahead of myself, I know how leads can dwindle away very quickly. I have to go out there, not take anything for granted and go out and play as hard as I’ve played the last three days. If I can do that, hopefully things will go my way.

“We’ll see what happens tomorrow because four shots on this golf course isn’t that much.”

Falling

The truth can hurt, and McIlroy was about to prove his assessment of Augusta to be true in the most excruciating way imaginable.

His fourth bogey of the week arrived immediately. Having admitted to expecting some nerves at the first tee, McIlroy sparked a booming opening drive down the fairway, only to miss his putt from five feet.

Three consecutive pars steadied the ship, but Schwartzel had the wind in his sails. A blistering birdie, par, eagle start had seen him draw level at the summit after his third hole.

A subsequent bogey from the South African slowed his charge, as McIlroy clung onto a one-shot lead at the turn from Schwartzel, Cabrera, Choi, and a rampaging Woods, who shot five birdies and an eagle across the front nine to send Augusta into a frenzy.

Despite his dwindling advantage and the raucous Tiger-mania din ahead of him, McIlroy had responded well to another bogey at the 5th hole, draining a brilliant 20-foot putt at the 7th to restore his lead.

The fist pump that followed marked the high-water point of McIlroy’s round, as a sliding start accelerated into full-blown free-fall at the par-four 10th hole.

His tee shot went careening into a tree, ricocheting to settle between the white cabins that separate the main course from the adjacent par-three course. It offered viewers a glimpse at a part of Augusta rarely seen on broadcast, followed by pictures of McIlroy anxiously peering out from behind a tree to track his follow-up shot.

Though his initial escape was successful, yet another collision with a tree and a two-putt on the green saw a stunned McIlroy eventually tap in for a triple bogey. Having led the field one hole and seven shots earlier, he arrived at the 11th tee in seventh.

By the time his tee drive at the 13th plopped into the creek, all thoughts of who might be the recipient of the green jacket had long-since switched away from the anguished youngster. It had taken him seven putts to navigate the previous two greens, as a bogey and a double bogey dropped him to five-under – the score he had held after just 11 holes of the tournament.

Mercifully, the last five holes passed without major incident. A missed putt for birdie from five feet at the final hole summed up McIlroy’s day, though he was given a rousing reception as he left the green.

Mere minutes earlier, the same crowd had erupted as Schwartzel sunk his fourth consecutive birdie to seal his first major title. After starting the day four shots adrift of McIlroy, the South African finished 10 shots ahead of him, and two ahead of second-placed Australian duo Jason Day and Adam Scott.

McIlroy’s eight-over 80 marked the highest score of the round. Having headlined the leaderboard for most of the week, he finished tied-15th.

Bounce-back

Tears would flow during a phone call with his parents the following morning, but at his press conference, McIlroy was upbeat.

“I’m very disappointed at the minute, and I’m sure I will be for the next few days, but I’ll get over it,” he said.

“I was leading this golf tournament with nine holes to go, and I just unraveled … It’s a Sunday at a major, what it can do.

“This is my first experience at it, and hopefully the next time I’m in this position I’ll be able to handle it a little better. I didn’t handle it particularly well today obviously, but it was a character-building day … I’ll come out stronger for it.”

Once again, McIlroy would be proven right.

Just eight weeks later in June, McIlroy rampaged to an eight-shot victory at the US Open. Records tumbled in his wake at Congressional, as he shot a tournament record 16-under 268 to become the youngest major winner since Tiger Woods at The Masters in 1997.

The historic victory kickstarted a golden era for McIlroy. After coasting to another eight-shot win at the PGA Championship in 2012, McIlroy became only the third golfer since 1934 to win three majors by the age of 25 with triumph at the 2014 Open Championship.

Before the year was out, he would add his fourth major title with another PGA Championship win.

And much of it was owed to that fateful afternoon at Augusta. In an interview with the BBC in 2015, McIlroy dubbed it “the most important day” of his career.

“If I had not had the whole unravelling, if I had just made a couple of bogeys coming down the stretch and lost by one, I would not have learned as much.

“Luckily, it did not take me long to get into a position like that again when I was leading a major and I was able to get over the line quite comfortably. It was a huge learning curve for me and I needed it, and thankfully I have been able to move on to bigger and better things.

“Looking back on what happened in 2011, it doesn’t seem as bad when you have four majors on your mantelpiece.”

The missing piece

McIlroy’s contentment came with a caveat: it would be “unthinkable” if he did not win The Masters in his career.

Yet as he prepares for his 15th appearance at Augusta National this week, a green jacket remains an elusive missing item from his wardrobe.

Despite seven top-10 finishes in his past 10 Masters outings, the trophy remains the only thing separating McIlroy from joining the ranks of golf immortals to have completed golf’s career grand slam of all four majors in the modern era: Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, and Tiger Woods.

A runner-up finish to Scottie Scheffler last year marked McIlroy’s best finish at Augusta, yet arguably 2011 remains the closest he has ever been to victory. A slow start in 2022 meant McIlroy had begun Sunday’s deciding round 10 shots adrift of the American, who teed off for his final hole with a five-shot lead despite McIlroy’s brilliant 64 finish.

At 33 years old, time is still on his side. Though 2022 extended his major drought to eight years, it featured arguably his best golf since that golden season in 2014.

2023 March Madness: UConn defeats San Diego State in the national championship game,"CNN —

The University of Connecticut won its fifth men’s basketball national title with a 76-59 victory over San Diego State University on Monday night at NRG Stadium in Houston.

Senior guard Tristen Newton led UConn (31-8) with 19 points and 10 rebounds while Final Four Most Outstanding Player Adama Sanogo, a junior forward, chipped in with 17 points and 10 rebounds.

“We weren’t ranked going into the year so we had the chip on our shoulder,” UConn head coach Dan Hurley told game broadcaster CBS. “We knew the level that we could play at, even through those dark times,” he added, referencing the team’s six losses in eight games during the regular season.

He said going into the tournament his group had confidence garnered during the season.

“And when you have the type of leaders like Andre Jackson (game-high six assists Monday) and Adama Sanogo, they kept this team together, got us back on track and we knew we were the best team in the tournament going in and we just had to play to our level,” he added.

San Diego State (32-7) was topped by Keshad Johnson who had 14 points.

UConn trailed very early but San Diego State was undone by an 11-minute, eight-second stretch in which they scored just five free throws and missed 12 consecutive shots from the field. The Huskies went from down 10-6 to up 36-24 at halftime.

The Aztecs made a run midway through the second half and narrowed the deficit to five at 60-55 with 5:19 to play but the Huskies scored the next nine to take a comfortable lead into the final two minutes.

“We battled. Battled back to five in the second half, but gave them too much separation,” San Diego State coach Brian Dutcher said. “We had to be at our best. We weren’t at our best. A lot had to do with UConn.”

Senior guard Adam Seiko told reporters they gave themselves a chance with their second half comeback but UConn “just made a little bit more plays” at the end.

“They have a lot of weapons. They were pretty good,” said Matt Bradley, also a senior guard. “To beat them, we had to make shots. I shot poorly. And you had to have a really good game to beat those dudes on the offensive end.”

UConn won each of its six tournament games by at least 10 points, with its closest game being a 13-point win over the University of Miami in the national semifinals.

“I just want to thank my teammates, my coaches who believed in me. If it were not for them I would not be here right now,” Sanogo told CBS.

Jordan Hawkins, who scored 16 points for UConn, talked about winning the crown one day after his cousin, Angel Reese of Louisiana State University, won the women’s title.

“I mean it’s absolutely amazing that we both get this opportunity and I mean the family reunion is going to be great so that’s all I know,” he said.

UConn enters rarefied air as only the sixth team to win five NCAA men’s basketball championships, joining UCLA (11), Kentucky (eight), North Carolina (six), Duke (five) and Indiana (five). All of UConn’s titles have come since 1999 with the most recent before Monday occurring in 2014.

Shania Twain calls for equal play and more diversity in country music,"CNN —

Shania Twain is standing up for others in country music.

The legendary star in the genre used her acceptance speech for the Equal Play Award at Sunday’s CMT Awards to call for more equity and diversity in the country music industry.

“When I wrote the phrase ‘Man I feel like a woman’ I honestly had no idea at the time it would become an undercurrent of a decades-long career,” she said, referring to one of her biggest hits. “It’s amazing how one statement can empower so many.”

The phrase, Twain said, “has been adopted by an array of fantastic communities all around the world and become a genuine path of power…which brings me so much joy.”

“I believe in an all-inclusive country music. We’re family,” Twain said. “This is a genre of music with a rich history that raised and nurtured my own songwriting and performance and recording career from childhood. Currently, the industry standard does a real disservice to this.”

Twain, who was presented the award by rapper Megan Thee Stallion, shouted out some of the diverse acts she is spotlighting on her “Queen of Me” tour this year, including Lily Rose, Lindsay Ell, Hailey Whitters, Mickey Guyton and others.

“I will continue to do my best as a trailblazer,” Twain said. “Together, let’s ensure all our fellow artists get equal play regardless of gender, age or race.”

She also performed acappella with the African American singing group, The BoykinZ, while presenting an award onstage.

Toby Carvery owner admits cutting down ancient Enfield oak tree,"Ancient oak tree cut down by Toby Carvery

PA Media The oak tree was found cut down on 3 April

The cutting down of an ancient oak in north London was ordered on health and safety grounds by the pub chain that owns Toby Carvery after it was told the tree was dead. The felled oak, estimated to be about 500 years old, was found by council workers at the edge of Whitewebbs Park in Enfield earlier in April. An emergency tree preservation order has now been imposed on what remains of the tree, which is near a Toby Carvery. The tree, with a girth of 6m (20ft), was a nationally significant pedunculate oak listed on the Woodland Trust's ancient tree inventory. A spokesperson for Mitchells & Butlers said: ""We took necessary measures to ensure any legal requirements were met.""

'Done the decent thing'

The pub chain spokesperson added: ""This was an important action to protect our employees and guests as well as the wider general public, to whom we have a duty of care."" Earlier, a Mitchells & Butlers source said the company had ""done the decent thing"" although they apologised to locals who loved the tree. Enfield Council's leader, Ergin Erbil, previously said they were treating the matter as criminal damage and had reported it to the police. The Met Police confirmed it had received a report from the council, but it is understood the force believes there is no evidence of criminality.

Woodland Trust Police confirmed they had received a report of criminal damage to the tree

The spokesperson for Mitchells & Butlers said: ""The tree was cut back after we were advised that it caused a serious health and safety risk. ""Upon further inspection, our specialist arboriculture contractors made the assessment that the split and dead wood posed a serious health and safety risk and advised that the tree was unsafe and should be removed. ""We are grateful to our expert contractors for warning us of this hazard so swiftly, allowing us to act before anyone was harmed.""

Paul Whiteing A local resident took a picture of a cherry-picker operating at the tree

Benny Hawksbee, a member of the Guardians of Whitewebbs group, said ""the tree belonged to Enfield and to our national heritage - I am devastated. ""We have now placed a legal protection [Tree Preservation Order] on the tree and are looking at ways to help it grow back."" Jon Stokes, director of trees, science and research at the Tree Council, said the felling of such a ""magnificent"" tree was shocking. ""Ancient oaks can live up to 1,000 years old and are as precious as our stately homes and castles,"" he said. ""Our nation's green heritage should be valued and protected and we will do everything we can to achieve this.""

PA Media There was outrage when the Sycamore Gap tree in Northumberland was chopped down in 2023

The Woodland Trust's head of campaigning Adam Cormack said: ""This depressing sight is a reminder to all of us that not every ancient tree is in a safe place. ""It is very unusual to see the felling of an oak tree of this size and age. Legally protected status for heritage trees like the Whitewebbs Oak is long overdue."" The trust's Living Legends petition, which aims to secure such status for heritage trees, and which attracted more than 100,000 signatures, was handed in to Downing Street in November.

The issue of tree preservation was highlighted after the destruction of the Sycamore Gap tree in September 2023. There was outrage when the tree, which stood in a dip next to Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland, was chopped down. Daniel Graham, 39, and Adam Carruthers, 32, both from Cumbria, are accused of causing criminal damage put at more than £600,000. The men, who deny the charge, will appear before a jury at a trial starting on 28 April at Newcastle Crown Court.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewgypewepno,1
Birmingham City Council 'on track' to clear waste backlog,"Birmingham council 'on track' to clear waste backlog

PA The standoff between bin workers and the council has led to bin bags and fly-tipped rubbish piling up on streets

Birmingham City Council says it is on track to clear a backlog of uncollected waste by the weekend, despite the ongoing dispute with the Unite union. Craig Cooper, strategic director of city operations, said collections would focus first on ""the poorest parts"" of the city ""affected the most"" by the ongoing bin strike. Mr Cooper said the amount of uncollected waste had peaked at 22,000 tonnes, but he expected to be back to ""one household collection every week"" for all residents by the weekend. Hundreds of bin workers began an all-out strike on 11 March, in a standoff with the Labour-run council that has led to bin bags and fly-tipped rubbish piling up on streets.

The city's residents are caught in the middle of the dispute, and many have told the BBC of their increasing frustrations, with one saying it ""can't go on"". Striking workers held a rally on Tuesday morning, a day after Unite union members rejected the city council's latest pay offer.

Bin workers belonging to the Unite union remain in a standoff with the council after an all-out strike started on 11 March

""We're already back to collecting normal household waste this week,"" Mr Cooper said. ""We are back into a position of good control. ""The priority now is street cleansing and making sure the fly-tipping is at a manageable level."" He added that the council had 120 bin lorries out every day completing rounds, which was roughly half of its total capacity. Garden waste and recycling will not be collected by the authority until the strike is over, he said. Mr Cooper described it as ""disappointing"" that an agreement had not been reached with Unite and urged them to ""come back to the table"" to end the dispute. More negotiations between the two sides are expected to take place on Wednesday.

The dispute centres around the council's decision to remove Waste Recycling and Collection Officer (WRCO) roles from some bin workers. On Monday, workers voted to reject the council's latest offer, which Unite said was ""totally inadequate"" and also did not address potential pay cuts for 200 drivers. A council spokesperson said the offer was fair and included options for affected workers. But one of them, Jordan McNeill, a mother-of-two who came to Tuesday's rally, said workers were already on a low wage. ""I'm not going to be able to pay my bills, I'm not going to be able to do things for my children,"" said Ms McNeill. ""I'm just going to be living day by day, thinking 'where am I going to get my food from? Where am I going to get everything else from? Where am I going to get my children's clothes from?' ""I don't know what I'm supposed to do.""

Bin worker Jordan McNeill said the cuts would affect her ability to pay her bills

Tuesday's rally took place outside the Council House, home of Birmingham City Council, with dozens of Unite officials, bin workers and supporters attending. There were cheers and loud horns from the crowd, who held up placards and flags. Unite said a petition supporting the striking workers and containing 3,000 signatures was handed in during the event.

Volunteer Haroon Hassan said the bin strike was ""very, very tough"" for residents

Many Brummies have stepped forward to help each other out during the strikes, with neighbours sharing trips to the tip and volunteer litter-pickers seeing their work increase. ""Where we can help people out, we should help out,"" said Haroon Hassan, who was collecting bin bags from residents and carrying them to a mobile waste centre in Small Heath on Tuesday. ""That's just being a good citizen, a good member of the community."" During the strike, the council has been running mobile collections where bin trucks park at a fixed location in a neighbourhood for a morning, so people can bring along their rubbish. Mr Hassan told BBC Radio WM that the bin strike had been ""very, very tough"" for residents, especially with the weather getting warmer in recent weeks. He said he was hopeful the two sides would soon find a solution, as ""this sort of stuff can't go on forever"".

Violet Williams said she felt ""awful"" when she saw photos of bin bags piling up in the city

Violet Williams, a Small Heath resident who was using the waste centre, said she felt ""awful"" when she saw photos of bin bags piling up on the city's streets, which have made headlines around the world. Ms Williams, who does not have a car, was dropping her rubbish off at the centre before taking a bus to collect more rubbish from her 92-year-old mother.

Bin workers at the rally stressed that they were not on strike in order to get a pay rise but in order to protect their existing roles and wages. One of them, Maxine Stanley, said: ""Once they say our wages [will be] left alone, we'll all go back to work. We're all Birmingham residents – my bins haven't been collected. ""But at the end of the day, we've got to stand firm against Birmingham City Council. ""I don't want Birmingham to look like this, I want it to be clean.""

Bin worker Samuel Yates said the strike aimed to protect people's existing wages, not get them a pay rise

""Not one of the people you see standing here wants to be on strike,"" said Samuel Yates, who holds one of the WRCO roles that is at the centre of the dispute. ""We don't want a wage rise; we just want a fair pay for the fair day's work that we do."" Mr Yates said he stood to lose £6,200 per year from his salary on top of a £1,200 wage cut that he had already had to accept. Many workers also said they did not like to see the city's streets in a poor state, but they felt they had to go on strike to protect their livelihoods. ""The majority of us don't just work in Birmingham; we actually live in Birmingham too, so we are Birmingham residents, and we're affected as much as the public are,"" said Steeven Biset.

As the strike rumbles on, national government ministers have also voiced concerns over the situation in the UK's second largest city. ""Our message, loud and clear, is that Unite needs to call off the strike, accept the deal, and let's get back to normal,"" industry minister Sarah Jones told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday. The union said its workers were striking in order to prevent pay cuts, not in a bid to get more money than they currently receive. ""Our members would like nothing better than to be able to call off the strike and get back to work,"" Onay Kasab, Unite national lead officer, told BBC Breakfast. ""But as things stand, we still have people who are going to be facing huge pay cuts as a result of this.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgqvnp88n51o,1

EPA Andrew Tate, pictured in the US in February, denies all of the women's allegations.

A civil case brought by four women against Andrew Tate is believed to be a legal first, a barrister for his accusers has said. The women accuse Tate of rape, assault and coercive control between 2013 and 2015. One claims he threatened to kill her, another says he made clear he would kill anyone who spoke to her, and a third claims he convinced her he had killed others. In written submissions, Anne Studd KC said she believed this was the first case of its kind in which it is argued that coercive control amounted to ""intentional infliction of harm"" - a legal concept similar to emotional distress. Tate denies the claims, saying they are a ""pack of lies"" and ""gross fabrications"".

The women are seeking damages ""arising from the assaults, batteries, and infliction of intentional harm"", their civil claim states. A case management hearing was held in London on Tuesday, which deals with preliminary matters and logistics. The court heard that a trial could be held in early 2027, and that it could last three weeks. Judge Richard Armstrong told the court the four women were ""seeking damages likely to reach six figures"". Proving the intentional infliction of harm would mean the claimants could be awarded additional damages. Coercive control, Ms Studd said, was ""a form of grooming and manipulation where the victim becomes less and less able to respond in what might be perceived as a normal way"". She added that a victim ""may not leave even if the door is open"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdde3l8j1njo,1

BBC The Lady: spring flowers, housekeepers and vital etiquette tips

The Lady, Britain's longest-running women's magazine, has formally announced that it has ceased publication. The magazine is famed for its etiquette advice and adverts for butlers, nannies and discreet liaisons with well-heeled 60-somethings. In a statement, the publishers confirmed recent media reports that the April edition of the magazine will be the last, but added that the website with its jobs board and recruitment agency will continue. Here's a look back at its place in, and impact on, British culture over 140 years.

The 'whole field of womanly action'

The Lady was established in 1885 by Thomas Gibson Bowles, as a magazine for gentlewomen, a weekly guide to navigating the social minefield of well-to-do British life. Its very distinctive character was affectionately lampooned by PG Wodehouse. In his Jeeves stories, Bertie Wooster is briefly employed by a magazine called Milady's Boudoir, which was housed ""in one of those rummy streets in the Covent Garden neighbourhood"". The real Lady Magazine just happened to be in Bedford Street in Covent Garden. The Lady's fame owed much to its advice to women on the mysteries of the British class system. In 1936, for instance, its readers were given an update on the acceptability of novels. ""The reading of fiction, not long ago thought deplorable by nearly all social workers, is now becoming almost a virtue,"" it noted. It's first edition began with an explanation that its objective was to cover ""the whole field of womanly action"". Almost all of it was written by a man - Bowles - using various aliases. It was not a huge success. Fortunes changed in 1894 when he appointed his children's governess, Rita Shell, to be editor.

Adverts for butlers have been largely replaced by ads for live-in carers

'How to sack a servant'

Under Shell's control, it became a successful weekly guide to women who found themselves in charge of both a household and a budget to outsource the daily drudgery to the lower classes. In December 1927, it cautioned young women ""to become a good cook before you marry, darling. Then you will be competent to rebuke a staff of domestics or to dispense with one"". Eighty years later, those concerns remained central. Editor Rachel Johnson was a firm believer in not being too familiar with staff, writing: ""Never sit in the kitchen chatting to your nanny, it'll end in tears before bedtime."" And even today there are still pages of classified adverts for livery workers and other assorted varieties of domestic help but the demand now is more for live-in carers for the elderly than butlers or nannies.

Rebranding The Lady

That age profile has long been a concern. In 2009, Johnson was taken on to give the magazine a more youthful rebrand. She was asked to halve the average of the reader, which was, when she started, 78. A Channel 4 documentary revealed it was not universally welcomed, and Johnson's diaries later catalogued all the difficulties of aiming articles at younger readers amongst adverts for walk-in baths and absorbent underwear along with products to remove their associated odours. It was an eventful three years that made more than a few headlines. Nevertheless, while the readership did briefly increase, like most print magazines, sales have been in sharp decline in recent years. Once a weekly, it went from fortnightly to monthly. The last published figures in 2023 revealed it sold just under 18,000 copies an issue.

The Lady's personal ads: surprisingly saucy

Custard creams in the safe

And while the website will continue, it is the end of the line for a very distinctive bit of British culture. The current owner of the Lady is the great grandson of the founder, Thomas Bowles. Ben Budworth has spent 17 years trying to keep it afloat. He took over the running of the magazine in 2008 and oversaw the controversial rebrand. His decision to sell off the Covent Garden offices and move production to a business park in Borehamwood in Hertfordshire was met with protest. The premises on Bedford Street were seen by many of the staff as more than just another office, they helped define The Lady's character. No-one had a direct phone line. Instead, calls all went through a telephonist. One former editor said work would stop at 2pm to listen to the Archers, and again at 3:30pm for tea. Johnson said the wall safe was where the tins of custard creams were stored. One particular perk was her own peach-coloured WC. Each day she would be handed two freshly laundered towels. The building was a reminder of its long history and the magazine's many contributors, among them Lewis Carroll, Nancy Mitford and Stella Gibbons, who while giving the impression of being hard at work wrote Cold Comfort Farm in the magazine's offices.

The newly crowned champion of Gladiators has described winning the show in front of his beloved grandmother as ""the best moment of my life"". Joe Fishburn, a 24-year-old Team GB gymnast from Scarborough, beat Mus Dumbuya in Saturday's final to be named the ultimate male winner of series two along with gym owner Amanda Wah, who won the women's competition. Mr Fishburn, who was raised by his grandmother Christine after his mum died when he was two, had previously said he hoped his life story would give people ""faith and hope when they face a challenge"". ""I can't tell you how amazing it feels,"" he said of his victory.

The gymnast was cheered on by friends and family, including his grandmother, throughout his time on the show. ""There have been so many times where I have competed abroad and she's not been able to travel,"" he said. ""For her to see me winning, even in the first round, going through the paper and getting to see her and everybody loving her - it was genuinely the best moment of my life.""

Mr Fishburn said seeing his family ""come together"" had been his highlight from the Gladiators 2025 experience. ""It was really incredible to have an occasion, not necessarily a sad one, where everyone can get behind you and get together,"" he explained. ""Family is incredibly important to me."" Ahead of taking on the Gladiators challenge, Mr Fishburn trained at Scarborough Gymnastics Academy. He devised a programme specific to the show under his coach Roddy Mackay, a former contestant in the original TV series. Mr Mackay said Mr Fishburn's victory was ""amazing - I knew he could win it"". ""His gymnastic abilities and his rugby abilities are just the perfect match for Gladiators,"" he said.

Mortgages: Choice of low-deposit deals hits highest for 17 years,"Low-deposit mortgage deals highest for 17 years

45 minutes ago Share Save Kevin Peachey Cost of living correspondent Share Save

More low-deposit mortgages are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008, according to new figures. The number of deals that need a deposit of 5% or 10% have risen to their highest level since then, data from financial information service Moneyfacts suggests. The extra choice is a boost for first-time buyers, although house prices and mortgage rates are higher than they were for much of the last 17 years. And competition is tough, with homes typically listed for just over a month before a sale is agreed, according to separate figures from property website Zoopla.

The UK housing market has been relatively settled in recent times, although buyers still need to navigate uncertainty over interest rates and changes to stamp duty in England and Northern Ireland.

'Flourishing choice'

For buyers able to offer a deposit of 5% of the home loan, there are 442 mortgages to choose from, according to Moneyfacts. Two years ago, the choice was from fewer than half of that total, at 204. Borrowers able to pay a 10% deposit now have 845 products to choose from, up from 684 in April 2023. However, they still have to pay a mortgage rate of well over 5% on average, while a borrower who pays a 40% deposit typically pays a rate of under 5%. It has been hard for many prospective first-time buyers to save due to the rising cost of renting in recent years.

Doug Hepper says saving up has been tough

Doug Hepper, 30, from Tewkesbury, is a dad and wants to buy his first home. But due to the cost of living doing so is almost impossible in the short-term, he said. ""When I grew up, I thought the normal thing was to get married, have kids and buy a house around the time of being 30,"" he added. ""The kid came first but I never thought the buying the house part would be so far out of reach."" But Rachel Springall, from Moneyfacts, said there was a flourishing choice of mortgages for those whose ability to pay a deposit is stretched. ""A rise in product availability for aspiring homeowners is a healthy step in the right direction,"" she said. However, she said only 6% of all deals available to borrowers across fixed and variable mortgages had a deposit requirement of 5%, so there was still ""room for improvement"". Mortgage rates remain difficult to predict owing to uncertainty created by US tariff policy on the wider economy.

While securing a mortgage is one thing, buyers also need to act relatively quickly when it comes to finding a new home, data suggests. Homes in England and Wales spend an average of 36 days on the market before a sale is agreed, according to news figures from the property portal Zoopla. Sales were agreed on half of homes within two months of being listed, it said. To complete a sale, sellers and buyers will typically need another four to six months, depending on the complexity of the transaction. The fastest sales were agreed for two-bedroom homes, at an average of 23 days, while homes with four bedrooms or more typically took an extra 15 days. Homes in northern regions of England tended to sell faster than homes in the south, where prices are higher, it said. Even so, the fastest selling, with an agreed sale taking an average of 19 days, had a north-south mix, with Manchester and the London borough of Waltham Forest hitting that mark. ""Households that are thinking about listing their home and moving in 2025 need to set their asking price at the right level and take the advice of local agents,"" said Richard Donnell, executive director at Zoopla. ""Buyers have a lot more choice of homes for sale than a year ago. Aiming too high on the asking price is likely to impact saleability and how long you may have to wait to agree a sale."" Zoopla uses a median average figure (the mid-point) for its data. It also discards homes that have been listed for more than six months, as it considers them to be unlikely to sell.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgxdyyz8e1o,1

A man has pleaded guilty to murdering his partner and neighbour on Christmas Day. Jazwell Brown stabbed Joanne Pearson, 38, and Teohna Grant, 24, at a block of flats in Santa Cruz Avenue, Bletchley, in Milton Keynes. At a hearing at Luton Crown Court on Tuesday, Brown, 49, also admitted attempting to murder 29-year-old Bradley Latter and a teenage boy during the same attack. He is due to be sentenced on 22 May.

Thames Valley Police Thames Valley Police described Brown, who will be sentenced in May, as ""dangerous""

Brown, also of Santa Cruz Avenue, spoke only to confirm his identity and enter pleas. He also admitted unlawfully possessing a knife in a public place and causing unnecessary suffering to a Staffordshire bull terrier. The two women were pronounced dead at the scene after officers arrived at the flats at 18:36 GMT on 25 December. Charles Miskin KC, representing Brown, said the 49-year-old had shown remorse for his actions and was ""profoundly sorry"". The judge remanded Brown in custody pending sentencing. Mr Justice Kerr also ruled that the child victim of attempted murder could not be identified in media reports of the case.

Det Ch Insp Stuart Brangwin, of Thames Valley Police, said: ""Jazwell Brown is a dangerous man and I am glad that he has pleaded guilty, accepting responsibility for his actions that day, but the deaths of Joanne and Teohna cannot be undone. ""This was a brutal attack on his own partner and neighbour, in their respective homes, where they should have been able to feel safe and secure."" Celia Mardon, a Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) lawyer, said: ""This was an inexplicable attack which has done irreversible damage - robbing two women of their lives and seriously injuring two others. ""The strength of the prosecution's case, which featured compelling witness, CCTV and forensic evidence, gave Jazwell Brown little choice but to admit his guilt, and we are pleased that those affected by this tragic event have been spared the process of a trial.

""While we may never know why Brown committed such mindless violence, we must remember the two lives that were needlessly lost. ""Our thoughts remain with the loved ones of Joanne and Teohna, and we hope that today's result provides them with some closure.""

Nicola Haseler/BBC The Christmas Day attacks took place in a shared flat block

The CPS said Brown and the two women had lived in a shared flat block and he had also stabbed Joanne's dog, Tilly, during the incident.

In a statement released after Tuesday's hearing, the CPS said Brown had ""fled the scene"", but had been spotted by eyewitnesses and captured on CCTV. It added: ""Responding to emergency calls, officers with Thames Valley Police quickly apprehended Brown and brought him into custody where he made several incriminating statements. ""These included 'I lost my cool tonight' and describing the incident as 'not self-defence, plain murder, it's plain murder, not self-defence'.""

Teachers in England move a step closer to striking,"Teachers in England move a step closer to striking

5 hours ago Share Save Hazel Shearing • @hazelshearing Education correspondent Reporting from NEU conference in Harrogate Share Save

Getty Images Schools in England closed when National Education Union members went on strike in 2023

Teachers in England will vote on whether or not to go on strike if the government stands by its pay offer for the next school year. The National Education Union (NEU), England's largest teaching union, says it will hold a formal ballot if the offer remains ""unacceptable"", or if no extra funding is announced. The government has recommended a 2.8% pay rise for teachers and expects most schools will need to make ""efficiencies"" to fund it. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said ""any move towards industrial action by teaching unions would be indefensible"".

The NEU wants a higher pay rise for teachers, and for the government to announce more money so that schools do not have to pay for it from their existing budgets. The announcement from its conference in Harrogate is a warning to ministers, but a few things would still need to happen in order for teachers to walk out of England's schools. The union will need to reject a final decision from the government on teacher pay - including both the size of the pay rise, and whether or not there will be any additional funding for it. If it does launch a formal ballot, enough members would need to vote and support strike action. That ballot could open for several months, meaning any strike action would likely take place in the autumn term at the earliest.

Dalilia Espindula, a primary school teacher from Enfield at the NEU conference, told the BBC she was ""sorry"" for the disruption to parents and their children if teachers were to walk out, but that strikes were ""a last resort"". ""We need to make 'efficiencies' - what's that meant to be? We already don't have enough,"" she added.

BBC/ Hazel Shearing Dalilia Espindula says there isn't enough support for children with education, health and care plans

Steve Ryan, a food technology teacher from Hertfordshire, told the BBC there was ""much less respect for teachers than there ever used to be"" and that staff were leaving schools ""in droves"". ""This is my last year of teaching. I'm due to retire, and, from what I see, I wouldn't like to carry on,"" he said.

BBC/ Hazel Shearing Steve Ryan says the biggest issue is that the pay recommendation hasn't come with additional funding

Parents in Harrogate were torn about the prospect of strikes. Katie said either she or her husband would have to take annual leave to look after their children if schools closed. Baris, whose 10-year-old goes to a special school, said he supported teachers' right to strike but he was concerned about school closures because it was ""vital"" for his son to attend full time. ""He wouldn't cope well,"" he said. ""It would really affect us badly."" Alessia, a hairdresser and mum of two, said there was ""far too much"" pressure on teachers. ""I would have loved to have been a primary school teacher,"" she said. ""But talking to so many clients who are teachers, [and hearing] their opinions of it, although they do it for the love of the job and the children, it's really just not a job that I think anyone would want any more.""

Alessia doesn't think teachers would walk out ""lightly""

Each year, the independent School Teachers Review Body (STRB) hears submissions from each side and makes recommendations on teacher pay to the government, who ultimately decide on how much to award. Daniel Kebede, the NEU's general secretary, said Ms Phillipson had the STRB's report ""on her desk"". ""We'd like to see that published at the earliest opportunity, with the funding settlement as well, so that we can come to a conclusion to avoid any further action,"" he told the BBC. ""No teacher wants to take strike action, but there is nothing as disruptive, actually at the moment, as an underfunded education system."" Ms Phillipson said: ""With school staff, parents and young people working so hard to turn the tide on school attendance, any move towards industrial action by teaching unions would be indefensible. ""Following a 5.5% pay award in hugely challenging fiscal context, I would urge NEU to put children first."" NEU members went on strike over pay in the first half of 2023, forcing many schools to close on eight days of action. The NEU called off action after the government revised its 2023 offer to 6.5%. Teachers were then given a 5.5% rise in 2024. In December, the government recommended a 2.8% pay rise for 2025. Last week, results from an informal NEU ballot showed 93.7% of members rejected the offer and 83.4% said they would be willing to strike. The turnout was 47.2%.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1drx2ng6qro,1

They deny causing or allowing the death of a child and gross negligence manslaughter.

Marten and the baby's father Mark Gordon are in the middle of a retrial at the Old Bailey in London.

Professor George Havenith, an expert on clothing and cold exposure, told the jury that baby Victoria would have been at a ""substantial risk of hypothermia.""

Constance Marten's newborn baby would have been exposed to ""substantial climatic cold stress"" in the first few days she spent camping on the South Downs in January 2023, a jury has heard.

In their first trial they were found guilty of concealing the birth of a child and perverting the course of justice by not reporting the death of their baby.

The court has heard that they went on the run after police found a placenta on the back seat of their car, which had caught fire on the M62.

After travelling by taxi from Liverpool, they spent two nights at hotels in Harwich and another night in a taxi driving from London to Newhaven in Sussex.

They then walked out onto the South Downs with a tent from Argos and two summer sleeping bags.

It was raining at the time and the temperature over the next few days was about 7.5C.

The baby's decomposing body was found in a plastic bag in a shed on a Brighton allotment almost two months later.

Prof Havenith told the jury he had conducted a number of experiments in a climate chamber at Loughborough University to recreate the conditions inside and outside the tent.

He said that the tent was a bit warmer than the outside air temperature: ""Inside the tent it gets up to five degrees (centigrade) higher than the outside,"" he said.

However, he said that with no mattresses, anyone lying on the floor of the tent would have been colder.

""The tent itself has virtually no insulation on the ground,"" he said.

He also conducted an experiment in which he asked two PhD students to sit inside the tent and found that within an hour they saw ""water running down the tent walls"", caused by the condensation of their breath.

Joel Smith KC, for the prosecution, asked if baby Victoria could have kept warm inside Constance Marten's coat if everything had remained dry.

""With a dry coat, dry clothing, dry sleeping bag, there would be just enough insulation to keep the baby safe,"" Professor Havenith said.

But then he was asked what would have happened if the clothing was wet.

""Baby Marten, in the conditions studied, especially where moisture was present In the clothing both in the tent and on the way to the South Downs, would have been exposed to substantial climatic cold stress which would have led to a substantial risk of hypothermia,"" he said, quoting from the conclusion of his report.

Mark Gordon and Constance Marten deny all charges.

Backlash over 'distressing' cuts to adoption fund,"Charities criticise 'distressing' cuts to adoption fund

Charities have criticised the government for cutting the amount of funding families in England can access to pay for therapy for adopted children by 40%. Adoption UK said the news was ""distressing"" for families, who had already faced ""an agonising wait"" to find out whether the adoption and special guardian support fund would continue. Last year each eligible child could access £2,500 for specialist assessment and £5,000 for therapy. But the therapy limit has now been cut to £3,000 per year, while separate funding for specialist assessment has been axed. The government said the move would ""ensure the fund is financially sustainable to allow more vulnerable children to access targeted support"".

In an email to stakeholders, seen by the BBC, the Department for Education said the ""difficult decision"" came as demand for the fund ""continues to grow significantly"". Nearly 20,000 children received support through the scheme last year, up from around 13,000 in 2019/20.

The future of the fund had been in doubt, until the government confirmed at the last minute that it would continue in 2025/26. In response to an urgent question in the House of Commons on 1 April - the day after the fund expired - Children and Families Minister Janet Daby said £50m had been allocated for this year. The overall funding for the scheme remains the same as last year. However, Adoption UK said the cut in the amount available per child would have ""a direct impact on children and young people who have had a very tough start in life"". The charity's chief executive, Emily Frith, said the decision was ""very short-sighted at a time when there are more adoptive families in crisis than ever before"".

Families 'in disbelief'

Louisa - not her real name - has used the fund to provide therapy for her two adopted sons and said it ""changed our lives"". ""Without it, we fear for their future, their ability to function in the world, attend school, be safe to others and themselves, and for our family stability,"" she told the BBC. Louisa said her own family and others affected were ""anxious, fearful, sad and in disbelief at what [the cut] means for their children"". For the last two years, her eldest has used the maximum allocation of funding for therapy. He had already been forced to stop his therapy sessions at the end of January because future funding had not been confirmed, leaving the family in ""limbo"" and ""watching the decline in front of our eyes"". Louisa said this meant he had not been able to attend school full-time and she feared he would continue to go backwards if he could no longer get the same level of support. She is also concerned that after her youngest has a specialist assessment, there will be little funding left for therapy. Liberal Democrat spokesperson for education, children and families Munira Wilson has written to Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson calling on her to reverse the cuts. Wilson said she was ""extremely disappointed"" the government had ""slipped out"" the announcement over the Easter break. In her letter, she said the cuts were causing ""immense worry and stress"" for families and ""cannot be justified"". The charity Kinship, which represents friends and families who step in to raise a child when parents are not able to, said the news was a ""further blow"", after therapy had been disrupted by the delay in renewing the scheme. Chief executive Dr Lucy Peake said the government's ""confused and ill-considered approach"" of boosting awareness of the scheme but not supporting this with extra funding ""risks pushing more families to breaking point"". Charities said the announcement would mean further delays for families trying to access therapy, while adoption agencies made adjustments to funding applications. The fund is available for adopted children and young people up to the age of 21, as well as those aged up to 25 if they have an education, health and care plan.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj68y4epe33o,1

A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a fatal house explosion that damaged multiple homes and cars in Nottinghamshire. Emergency services were called to John Street in Worksop at 19:39 BST on Saturday evening. David Howard, 53, was found in the rubble and declared dead at the scene. Nottinghamshire Police said a 43-year-old man had been questioned and then bailed pending further investigation.

Officers said the cause of the explosion remained unclear and they were keeping an open mind at this stage in the investigation. Det Ch Insp Ruby Burrow said: ""Whilst we have made an arrest, I want to be really clear that our investigation remains at a very early stage and we are doing everything possible to establish what caused this deeply tragic incident. ""It remains too early to say whether there is a criminal element to this case and would ask that people avoid speculation.""

Nottinghamshire Police David Howard, 53, died in the explosion in John Street

One terraced house was destroyed and two more partially collapsed in the blast. Eight other properties and 20 cars were damaged by debris, police added. About 50 people from 35 properties were evacuated, and while many have returned, a number are still in temporary accommodation. Part of John Street is still cordoned off while demolition and investigation work continues. One other person was treated for minor injuries, police said, but everyone in the area has been accounted for. Bassetlaw District Council has warned it could be up to two weeks before residents from properties within the remaining cordon can return home. The authority has joined Nottinghamshire County Council and the police in thanking the public for their patience and cooperation in the aftermath of the emergency.

The clear-up operation began on Monday with damaged walls being removed

On Monday, residents spoke of their shock. Debbie Adams, who lives on the same road, said the explosion shook her house and filled her dining room with dust. She went into the street and saw the house ""totally collapsed"" and neighbours walking in clouds of dust. Piotr Peruki, whose house backs on to the scene, slept in his car and took a day off work due to exhaustion and shock. His teenage son was also badly affected. ""For him it was a very bad experience, he is scared,"" he said.

BBC Social media user Zoë Bread operates under a loaf-based alias

A masked campaigner who hides her face behind a slice of bread in viral TikTok videos about parking fines has forced Manchester City Council to review its signage policies. The T-shirt designer and filmmaker, who goes by the online alias Zoë Bread, had received a fine after parking on Collier Street in the city centre and buying a ticket at the wrong meter. She told the BBC the Pay At Machine sign pointed both to the private car park and the council one. The council said it would ""explore if additional signage is needed"" after the videos by the self-styled social media investigator documented her penalty charge notice, rejection of her parking fine appeal and other people's similar stories.

In her videos, Zoë Bread filmed a ""stake-out"" of the bays and said she had met other drivers who had received parking tickets ""for the exact same reason"", as well as contacting a council agent who informed her the council's then view was that the signage was not misleading. ""They're saying it's not [misleading] yet others have been misled, that's the definition of misleading: it's not just me,"" she said.

Social media videos about the parking ticket confusion have attracted large online audiences.

During her investigations into the parking problems on the road, she submitted a Freedom of Information request to the council and reviewed official documents on the number of parking fines issued on the road. Zoë Bread claimed that the opening of the SIP private car park in 2018 had corresponded with an increase in the number of fines being issued on the road. ""I have a lot of time to go investigate things,"" she said. ""Usually I do joke investigations, I don't take things seriously, but I would never joke about these five parking spaces and misleading signage on Collier Street now."" Her videos have also attracted the attention of opposition Liberal Democrat councillor Alan Good, who contacted Zoë Bread after her films appeared on his social media newsfeed.

'Some confusion'

Good, who represents Ancoats and Beswick, told the BBC that he had visited the street in question and that he believed parking fines appealed on the street due to confusion over signage should be ""rescinded"". ""They can take a bit more of a human and more of a common sense approach to parking enforcement,"" he said. ""This is one of those times they really need to come down here for themselves and have a look and install a new meter."" Manchester City Council said the authority believed there was ""clear signage indicating there is a private car park in operation at the Collier Street Arches and that the majority of people are able to purchase a valid parking ticket"". But a spokesman acknowledged there had been ""some confusion amongst a small number of motorists who have bought a ticket from the wrong machine"". The local authority would now ""explore if additional signage is needed to ensure that in the future, motorists are directed to the correct ticket machine"", he added.

Andre Onana: Why Ruben Amorim's next decision on Man Utd goalkeeper issue is so big,"Among all the chaos around Manchester United's season and the talk of summer transfer priorities, the goalkeeper situation had not been top of the list.

Yes, Andre Onana's £47.5m transfer was one of those ""inherited"" deals namechecked by co-owner Sir Jim Ractliffe, as part of the £400m the club still owes on unpaid transfer fees.

And Ratcliffe did mention Onana by name as he talked about getting ""the house in order"" financially, and explaining why it will take time for the club ""to move away from the past into a new place in the future"".

But when former United midfielder Nemanja Matic labelled Onana one of United's ""worst-ever goalkeepers"" - and then the Cameroon international subsequently made two more errors in last week's 2-2 draw in Lyon - yet another 'crisis' in United's chaotic season emerged.

Amorim will be asked by media on Wednesday who will start in goal for their crucial Europa League quarter-final with Lyon, Onana or United's latest scapegoat, number two Altay Bayindir.

Whether he chooses to answer or not is a different matter. But when the choice is made between the goalkeepers, it could shape what the future looks like for Amorim and his ailing team.

Leaving Onana out of the Premier League defeat at Newcastle was the easy bit.

In terms of the domestic situation, barring an unlikely late season surge into a Uefa Conference League spot, United's campaign is done. Telling Onana to have the weekend off and clear his head was a decision with few negatives attached.

The same cannot be applied to the decision Amorim has to make on Thursday. No matter which keeper misses out, they have to be on the bench.

The goalkeeper overlooked will surely be looking for a new club this summer.

And it could yet turn out both will leave - meaning more money being paid out on replacements that the club can ill afford.

It is not an ideal situation and not one United chiefs were thinking about when Amorim arrived at the club from Sporting in November.

Rory McIlroy not speaking to Bryson DeChambeau at Masters was 'part of his game plan',"Northern Ireland's McIlroy beat England's Justin Rose in a sudden-death play-off, after a dramatic final round that saw him blow a four-shot lead at one stage and miss a par putt on the 18th to win in regulation.

""If you watched Rory, he was very locked into his own world. It's just you and the golf course and your caddie,"" said Rotella.

""You get lost in this world that you've made up, and play the game you love. I think he did a beautiful job of that all day. He did so many things to bounce back time after time.""

Part of their strategy involved McIlroy's yardage book, which he could be seen looking at many times throughout his round.

The book usually includes maps or diagrams of each hole on the course, but Rotella said it also included notes of their chats.

""We would have a chat every day before the round, and he would make some notes, and every couple of holes, he would take a look around to remind yourself. That's what he was looking at,"" he added.

Explaining the psychology further, Rotella said that after a disappointment a player should aim to make the ""next shot your best shot"".

""We begin with the idea that golf, by design, is a game of mistakes, and if you love golf, you have to love the mistakes,"" he said.

""You have to remind them that other players are playing the same game, and they will also all make mistakes.

""The second part is understanding that you are a human being, you're going to make mistakes. Human beings have a free will, and that means we get to choose how we think and respond to all the crazy things that happen to us on the golf course and in life.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/cq807wd37dxo,1
"Tyson Fury retirement: Promoter Bob Arum believes Fury ""will never fight again""","Promoter Bob Arum believes Tyson Fury will not return to boxing after the heavyweight announced his retirement in January.

The 36-year-old Briton made the surprise decision just a few weeks after suffering a second successive loss to WBA (Super), WBC and WBO champion Oleksandr Usyk.

Fury has retired more than once in his illustrious career, but American Arum - who promoted him in the past - does not expect another U-turn from the fighter.

""If I was a betting man I would say he will never fight again,"" Arum told the 5 Live Boxing podcast with Steve Bunce.

""Marvin Hagler had an expression - 'a rich guy who goes to bed wearing silk pyjamas doesn't get up in the morning to do road work'.

""Tyson, really, I don't think wants to get up in the morning and do road work and go through the experience of having to train when economically he doesn't have to do it any more.""

Despite the retirement announcement, it has not stopped rivals calling Fury out, or fans speculating about a potential comeback following an appearance of him working out in his personal gym.

Fury has retired five times, including in 2017 amid a dispute with UK Anti-Doping before making his comeback in 2018, and after beating Dillian Whyte in April 2022, returning later that year.

His last three fights took place in Saudi Arabia, having last fought in the UK in 2022 when he outclassed compatriot Derek Chisora at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

Fury has a record of 34 wins, one draw and two defeats.

Those two losses came against Ukraine's Usyk, who ended Fury's 15-year unbeaten streak as a professional in their first contest last May, before winning the December rematch.

Promoter Eddie Hearn last week suggested the long-awaited domestic bout between Fury and Anthony Joshua could still happen - should the Gypsy King personally reach out to his domestic rival.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/boxing/articles/clyqqw5d2qxo,1

Minister Lucy Powell's X account hacked to promote crypto scam,"Minister's X account hacked to promote crypto scam

Other public figures with a large number of followers who have been targeted in a similar way by online hackers recently include BBC journalist Nick Robinson.

The MP's office confirmed her account was hacked on Tuesday morning and said ""steps were taken quickly to secure the account and remove misleading posts"".

A string of now deleted posts on the House of Commons leader's account described the ""$HCC"" coin as ""a community-driven digital currency bringing people's power to the blockchain"".

Government minister Lucy Powell's X account has been hacked to promote a scam ""House of Commons"" cryptocurrency.

The role is responsible for planning and supervising the government's legislative programme, while also upholding the rights of backbench MPs.

The MP for Manchester Central, who has nearly 70,000 followers on X, has been leader of the House of Commons since Labour won power last summer.

Some of the posts from Powell's account, which is verified by the platform and mentions her cabinet position in the bio, included an image of the House of Commons logo.

A screengrab of one of the posts on Powell's account, which was quickly deleted

Taking over X accounts to advertise scam crypto coins is a common method used by cyber criminals.

Fraudsters often take over accounts using phishing emails - scam emails containing links to websites that either access systems or trick users into sharing their passwords.

Passwords can also be obtained using leaked information from data breaches.

At that point cyber criminals take over the account and plan their posts around hastily spun up crypto coins that can only take a couple of hours to create and launch.

They hope that high-profile and trusted accounts might encourage people to buy some of the otherwise worthless coins so that they can make some money before it all get blocked and stopped.

Luke Nolan, a senior research associate at CoinShares, an asset management company specialising in digital assets, said the hack of Powell's account was an example of ""pump and dump"".

This is when the people who created the cryptocoin inflate its value, get others to invest, and then sell their majority share to get profit, but leave the coin worthless.

Mr Nolan said there had only been 34 transactions on the coin, which would have led to a profit of about £225.

A House of Commons spokesman said: ""UK Parliament takes cyber security extremely seriously.

""We provide advice to users - including Members - to make them aware of the risks and how to manage their digital safety; however, we do not comment on specific details of our cyber security policies.""

Action Fraud said there was a rise in social and email accounts being hacked in 2024, with 35,343 reports.

It advises setting up 2-step verification for accounts and using a strong, unique password of three random words.

Earlier this year Robinson, who presents BBC Radio 4's Today programme, said his X account was hacked after he clicked on an email he wrongly believed was sent to him by the social media platform.

Mark Zuckerberg defends Meta in social media monopoly trial,"Mark Zuckerberg defends Meta in social media monopoly trial

Getty Images Mark Zuckerberg leaves court on Monday

Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg has taken the witness stand in a landmark antitrust trial to defend his company against allegations that his company operates a social media monopoly. His testimony is part of a case first brought by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2020 during the final days of the first Trump administration. The US competition watchdog alleges Meta unfairly dominated the market through its acquisitions of photo-sharing app Instagram in 2012 and the messaging service WhatsApp in 2014. The FTC is seeking to break up Meta by forcing a spinoff of Instagram or WhatsApp. Meta says there's plenty of competition in social media, including from apps such as TikTok, X, and YouTube.

Wearing a dark suit and light blue tie, Mr Zuckerberg was the first witness in the case on Monday at a federal court in Washington DC. The trial is expected to last for two months. The FTC pointed to a 2011 email Mr Zuckerberg sent saying: ""Instagram seems like it's growing quickly."" The following year, he sent another email saying the company was ""so far behind that we don't even understand how far behind we are... I worry that it will take us too long to catch up"". On the stand, Mr Zuckerberg defended his statements, calling the emails ""relatively early"" conversations about buying the app. He added that Meta had improved Instagram over the years.

Reuters The trial could last until July

Mr Zuckerberg also said he wanted to buy Instagram because of its camera technology, not because of its social network. He is expected to continue his testimony on Tuesday. The FTC says the company overpaid when it acquired Instagram for $1bn and WhatsApp for $19bn as a defensive move. ""They decided that competition was too hard and it would be easier to buy out their rivals than to compete with them,"" said FTC lawyer Daniel Matheson in his opening statement at Monday's trial. Meta countered that the lawsuit from the FTC, which originally reviewed and approved both those acquisitions, was ""misguided"". Meta ""acquired Instagram and WhatsApp to improve and grow them alongside Facebook"", the company's attorney Mark Hansen argued. The FTC lawyer cited a 2012 memo from Mr Zuckerberg in which he discusses the importance of ""neutralising"" Instagram. Mr Matheson called that message ""a smoking gun"". Meta, on the other hand, said the purchases made the consumer experience better. ""Acquisitions to improve and grow"" have never been found unlawful, Meta's lead litigator, said on Monday, ""and they should not be found unlawful here"". Meta said last year that it had 3.27 billion daily active users across its products. Instagram was expected to account for more than half of Meta's advertising revenue in the US in 2025. according to research firm Emarketer.

Meta has been making regular overtures to Trump since his election. The company contributed $1m to Trump's inaugural fund, and has added former Trump adviser Dina Powell McCormick and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) boss Dana White, a Trump ally, to Meta's board of directors this year. The company also announced in January that it was rolling back content moderation policies that Republicans said had amounted to censorship. It also agreed to pay Trump $25m to settle a lawsuit over the suspension of his accounts after the US Capitol riot in 2021. Mr Zuckerberg has also visited the White House in recent weeks. The Meta boss has lobbied Trump in person to have the FTC drop the case, according to the Wall Street Journal. When asked by the BBC to confirm that report, Meta sidestepped the question but said in a statement: ""The FTC's lawsuits against Meta defies reality.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2z80e2kjo,1

Sony has raised the price of its PlayStation 5 consoles worldwide, citing ""challenging"" market conditions. The price of the digital edition of the PS5 console in the UK has increased by £40 to £429.99. Its cost for European customers has risen by approximately €50 to €499.99. The company pointed to high inflation and ""fluctuating exchange rates"" in a blog post explaining its decision.

Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) executive Isabelle Tomatis said PS5 prices in Australia and New Zealand would also rise - including for physical versions that have a disc drive. The company said the price of the physical edition of the console would not change in the UK. But it has reduced the cost of its disc drives - which are required for those with digital consoles who want to play physical media - from £99.99 to £69.99 in the UK. Piers Harding-Rolls, research director at Ampere Analysis, said the disc-free version of the PS5 had formed a larger share of Sony's total sales over the last 18 months. He said this new price adjustment had brought ""the digital edition more into alignment with the standard version"".

ChatGPT AI action dolls: Concerns around the Barbie-like viral social trend,"Everyone's jumping on the AI doll trend - but what are the concerns?

Robert Timothy/BBC/ChatGPT Left: BBC technology editor Zoe Kleinman. Right: Her AI-generated action figure

When scrolling through social media, you may have recently seen friends and family appearing in miniature. It's part of a new trend where people use generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT and Copilot to re-package themselves - literally - as pocket-sized dolls and action figures. It has taken off online, with brands and influencers dabbling in creating their mini-me. But some are urging people to steer clear of the seemingly innocent trend, saying fear of missing out shouldn't override concerns about AI's energy and data use.

How does the AI doll generator work?

It may sound complicated, but the process is simple. People upload a picture of themselves to a tool like ChatGPT, along with written prompts that explain how they want the final picture to look. These instructions are really important. They tell the AI tool everything it is meant to generate, from the items a person wants to appear with to the kind of packaging they should be in - which includes mimicking the box and font of popular toys like Barbie.

Many online will then personalise it further with their name, job and clothing choices. Though it does not always work, and many have also shared some of the amusing mistakes the tools made, where the action dolls look nothing like them.

Like other generative AI tools, image generators are also prone to making things up, and may make assumptions about how someone should look. And it's not just regular people using it - the trend has been seized upon by a wealth of brands online including beauty company Mario Badescu and even Royal Mail.

What's the appeal?

Trends come and go - but by their very nature can make people feel compelled to take part to avoid missing out. ""Generative AI makes it easier and quicker for people to create and jump on trends,"" says Jasmine Enberg, principal social media analyst at eMarketer. She says the technology has made it quicker and easier to make online content, which may have the unexpected effect of quickening the pace at which other social media users get annoyed by it. But she believes AI-driven trends will become a more regular appearance on our feeds ""as the tech becomes a more regular part of our digital lives"".

What are the big concerns?

While its light-hearted nature may have drawn people to it, the trend has drawn criticism from some concerned about its environmental impact. Professor Gina Neff of Queen Mary University London tells the BBC that ChatGPT is ""burning through energy"", and the data centres used to power it consume more electricity in a year than 117 countries. ""We have a joke in my house that every time we create one of these AI memes, it kills a tree,"" says Lance Ulanoff, US editor of TechRadar, in an article about the trend. ""That's hyperbole, of course, but it's safe to say that AI content generation is not without costs, and perhaps we should be thinking about it and using it differently.""

People have also highlighted concerns that copyrighted data may have been used to create the technology which generates images without paying for it. ""ChatGPT Barbie represents a triple threat to our privacy, our culture and our planet,"" says Ms Neff. ""While the personalisation might feel nice, these systems are putting brands and characters into a blender with no responsibility for the slop that emerges."" And Jo Bromilow, director of social and influencer at PR and creative agency MSL UK, asks: ""Is a cute, funny result really worth it?"" ""If we're going to really use AI properly, we have to set guardrails around how we use it conscientiously,"" she says.

Testing the AI doll trend

You have to upload your own selfie with your prompt and you also have to be very specific about what you want, including a list of which accessories you'd like included and what colour you want the box to be.

The Copilot+ Recall feature is available in preview mode to some people with Microsoft's AI PCs and laptops. It is the relaunch of a feature which was dubbed a ""privacy nightmare"" when it was first announced last year. Microsoft paused the rollout in 2024, and after trialling the tech with a small number of users, it has begun expanding access to those signed up to its Windows Insider software testing programme. The BBC has approached Microsoft for comment.

Microsoft says Recall will be rolled out worldwide, but those based in the EU will have to wait until later in 2025. Users will opt in to the feature and Microsoft says they can ""can pause saving snapshots at any time"". The purpose of Recall is to allow PC users to easily search through their past activity including files, photos, emails and browsing history. For example, Microsoft says a person who saw a dress online a few days ago would be able to use the feature to easily locate where they saw it.

The countersuit opens up a new front in the high-stakes - and long-running - battle between two Silicon Valley heavyweights, who both say they are acting in the best interests of OpenAI and the public.

Mr Musk sued OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman last year in a bid to stop him from changing its corporate structure. He co-founded OpenAI with Mr Altman but left several years ago.

The company accuses the Tesla boss of using ""bad-faith tactics"" against OpenAI to help him control cutting-edge AI technology.

OpenAI is suing Elon Musk over claims he has tried ""nonstop"" to slow down its business for his own benefit.

""Elon's nonstop actions against us are just bad-faith tactics to slow down OpenAI and seize control of the leading AI innovations for his personal benefit,"" OpenAI said in a statement on Wednesday. ""Today, we countersued to stop him.""

Last week, a federal judge in Oakland, California, set a March 2026 trial date in Mr Musk's suit in a bid to fast-track the legal fight.

US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers previously declined to grant Mr Musk an injunction that would temporarily halt OpenAI's conversion from a non-profit to a for-profit company.

She also said that she expected Mr Musk to give evidence in the case.

Mr Musk alleges that OpenAI strayed from its founding mission as a non-profit to develop AI for the benefit of humanity and is therefore in breach of contract.

He left the company in 2018.

""This is about control. This is about revenue. It's basically about one person saying, 'I want control of that start-up',"" said Ari Lightman, professor of digital media and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University.

Lightman said it has been a distraction from making AI safe and equitable.

""That takes a backseat with all this rigmarole over control and monetization,"" Lightman said.

OpenAI claims Mr Musk has ""been spreading false information about us,"" in a X post on Wednesday, adding ""Elon's never been about the mission. He's always been about his own agenda.""

Musk's xAI is a competitor to OpenAI, but has so far lagged behind. Last month, xAI acquired Musk's social media platform X - formerly Twitter.

Mr Musk claims the combined company, XAI Holdings, is valued at more than $100 billion.

In February, Mr Musk made an unsolicited bid for OpenAI, offering to buy it for $97.4 billion, which Mr Altman rejected by posting: ""no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.""

In a statement to the BBC, Mr Musk's lawyer Marc Toberoff said: ""Had OpenAI's Board genuinely considered the bid, as they were obligated to do, they would have seen just how serious it was.""

""It's apparent they prefer to negotiate with themselves on both sides of the table than engage in a bona fide transaction in the best interests of the charity and the public,"" Mr Toberoff added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4114271x2o,1
Will iPhones cost more because of Trump's tariffs on China?,"Will iPhones cost more because of Trump's tariffs on China?

5 days ago Share Save Liv McMahon Technology reporter Zoe Kleinman • @zsk Technology editor Share Save

Reuters

The world's most popular gadgets - phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches - could be about to get a lot more expensive in the US. Many of them are made in China, which now faces a 145% tariff on its goods imported to the US, under President Donald Trump's controversial trade policy. The effect this may have on the iPhone and its maker Apple is under the spotlight - with some analysts saying if costs are passed onto consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise by hundreds of dollars. And if the tariffs impact the value of the dollar, it could become more expensive to import iPhones and other devices around the world - potentially leading to higher prices in UK shops.

Ben Wood of CCS Insight told the BBC that if tariffs remain in place, Apple may raise iPhone prices globally when the next iteration is launched. ""It is unlikely the company would want to have differentiated pricing globally,"" he said - as the tech giant would want to avoid people buying the device cheaply in the UK and selling it on for profit in the US. Though others say they believe it could result in cheaper prices if firms which normally send their goods to the US instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK. And there may be a significant change if the cost of tariffs is passed onto consumers globally - longer contracts to spread out the cost of the device. While a phone contract may typically last two years, Mr Wood said some firms already offer four year deals, and he believed ""we might see five-year contracts"" in 2025. ""One could argue it is almost like having a mortgage for your smartphone,"" he said.

Where are iPhones made?

The US is a major market for iPhones and Apple accounted for more than half of its smartphones sales last year, according to Counterpoint Research. It says as much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China, with the remaining 20% made in India. Along with fellow smartphone giants such as Samsung, Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chains to avoid over-reliance on China in recent years. India and Vietnam emerged as frontrunners for additional manufacturing hubs. As tariffs took effect, Apple reportedly looked to speed up and increase its production of India-produced devices in recent days. Reuters reported on Thursday that Apple chartered cargo flights to ship more than 600 tons of iPhones from India to the US. Amid Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs, including those levied on India, the country may be set to benefit from an iPhone manufacturing boost. The BBC has approached Apple for comment on the impact of tariffs on their operations and prices, but has not had any response yet.

How exposed is Apple to tariffs?

Trump and his advisors have said the aim of its tariffs are to encourage more US manufacturing. However, the tech industry relies on a global network of suppliers for product components and assembly. This, and finding skilled workers to match the fast pace and low cost of production in Asia, means relocating supply chains is no simple feat. Apple committed a $500bn (£385bn) investment in the US in February - which the Trump administration believes will result in more homegrown manufacturing. But Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said shifting parts of its supply chain from cheaper manufacturing hubs in Asia to the US will take a lot of time, and money. ""The reality is it would take 3 years and $30 billion dollars in our estimation to move even 10% of its supply chain from Asia to the US with major disruption in the process,"" he wrote on X on 3 April.

Will iPhone prices go up?

Apple have not revealed yet whether they plan to pass on the costs of the tariffs onto consumers in the US and increase prices. Some analysts believe Apple is in a more fortunate position than others, having reaped more money from its products than it has spent on making them. ""As a company with lucrative margins on its devices, Apple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,"" says Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee. But he notes the company's strong branding and popularity may allow it to pass some costs to consumers without too much backlash. ""The brand commands better loyalty than its competitors, and it is unlikely that a manageable price increase will send these customers fleeing into the arms of Android-based competitors."" Some estimates suggest iPhone prices in the US could as much as triple if costs were passed to consumers. Following Trump's tariff increase on China to 125%, the cost for a China-made iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB storage would have surged from $1,199 to $1,999, according to estimates by investment banking firm UBS. They estimate a less significant increase on the iPhone 16 Pro 128GB storage - which is made in India - by five percent from $999 to $1046. While some analysts such as Dan Ives have suggested that the cost of a ""Made in USA"" iPhone could soar to as much as $3500.

What can consumers do about it?

There's still plenty of uncertainty about what happens next, and how companies like Apple will respond to tariffs remains to be seen. This hasn't stopped some US customers reportedly rushing to Apple stores to buy its smartphones. The BBC spoke to shoppers outside an Apple Store in New York who had bought products in fear of a potential price hike. Anthony Cacioppo, a 53-year-old DJ and security technician, purchased the new iPhone. ""I really didn't need a phone... but I'm not ready to pay double the price,"" he said. Bruce Conroy, a hair stylist, told the BBC that even if prices had risen considerably he ""would have stuck with Apple products"" - though potentially delayed his purchase of a new iPad. ""I bought it because the tariffs are coming, I want to buy before the prices go up and I expect they will,"" said Julia Baumann, a personal finance editor, of her new MacBook.

Julia told the BBC she was expecting costs to rise across a wealth of areas, from groceries to gadgets

We will likely have to wait until the autumn to see how much the next iPhone will cost. But if it looks like costs incurred by tariffs will result in higher price tags, some may look to rival handsets or second-hand devices. CCS Insight estimates that 5.5m second-hand smartphones will be sold in the UK in 2025, representing 29.7% of the total market. The iPhone remains one of the most expensive smartphones on the market - and brands such as Google and Samsung offer phones with similar features at a lower cost. The other option, and perhaps the most cost-effective, could be for people to skip upgrades to newer iPhone models and look to slightly older, cheaper versions. ""The path of least resistance would be to keep the smartphone they already have for longer,"" said Mr Wood.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx28845z30go,1

Meta ""acquired Instagram and WhatsApp to improve and grow them alongside Facebook,"" the company's attorney Mark Hansen argued. A win by the FTC could force CEO Mark Zuckerberg break up the company. That could include spinning off photo sharing app Instagram and messaging service WhatsApp. The FTC says the company overpaid when it acquired Instagram for $1 billion in 2012. Two years later, it purchased the WhatsApp for $19 billion. ""The [FTC's] argument is the acquisition of Instagram was a way of neutralising this rising competitive threat to Facebook,"" says Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor of antitrust law at Vanderbilt Law School. Ms Allensworth says Mr Zuckerberg's own words, including those from his emails, may offer the most convincing evidence at trial. ""He said it's better to buy than to compete. It's hard to get more literal than that,"" Ms Allensworth says. On Monday, Matheson referenced a 2012 memo from Zuckerberg in which he discusses the importance of ""neutralising"" Instagram. Matheson called the message ""a smoking gun."" Meta, on the other hand, said the purchases made the consumer experience better. ""Acquisitions to improve and grow"" have never been found unlawful, Hansen said Monday, ""and they should not be found unlawful here."" The company maintains that it faces competition from a slew of other apps, including TikTok, X, YouTube, and iMessage. Mr Zuckerberg and the company's former chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg are both expected to testify at the trial, which could run for several weeks.

Shifting politics

The case, FTC v Meta, was filed during US President Donald Trump's first administration but risks becoming politicised during his second term. Mr Zuckerberg has lobbied Trump in person to have the FTC drop the case, according to the Wall Street Journal. When asked by the BBC to confirm that report, Meta sidestepped the question but said in a statement: ""The FTC's lawsuits against Meta defies reality."" ""More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the commission's action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final,"" a Meta spokesperson told the BBC. Relations between Mr Zuckerberg and Trump had been frosty partly because Trump was barred from Meta's social media platforms after the US Capitol riot in January 2021. Since then, the relationship has thawed somewhat. Meta contributed $1m (£764,400) to Trump's inaugural fund, and has added former Trump adviser Dina Powell McCormick and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) boss Dana White, a Trump ally, to Meta's board of directors this year. The company also announced in January that it was doing away with independent fact-checkers and had agreed to pay Trump $25 million to settle a lawsuit over the suspension of his accounts after the 6 January Capitol riots in 2021.

'A very clear message'

President Trump's move to fire two FTC commissioners in March also hangs over the case. As Democrats, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya were in the minority on the five-seat commission. Until Wednesday, just two seats of those seats were filled, both by Republicans. Another Republican was confirmed by the Senate on Thursday. Slaughter and Bedoya - who are suing the Trump administration to be reinstated - say the move to push them out was meant to intimidate. ""The president sent a very clear signal not only to us but to Chairman Ferguson and Commissioner [Melissa] Holyoak that if they do something he doesn't like, he could fire them too,"" Slaughter told the BBC in a recent interview. ""So if they don't want to do a favour for his political allies, they're on the chopping block as well,"" Slaughter said. Slaughter and Bedoya both expressed alarm at recent reports about Zuckerberg's lobbying efforts. ""My hope is that there is no political interference,"" Mr Bedoya told the BBC.

Reuters

The FTC did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC. Ferguson, who was appointed as FTC chair by Trump, recently told The Verge he would ""obey lawful orders"" when asked what he would do if the president directed him to drop a lawsuit like the one against Meta. Ferguson added that he would be very surprised if anything like that ever happened. The FTC is considered a key antitrust watchdog. In recent years, it has returned hundreds of millions of dollars to victims of fraud, in addition to passing laws that ban junk fees and subscription traps. But as the Meta trial begins, it's among the many independent regulatory agencies that the administration seems keen to rein in. Chair Ferguson is also recently quoted reaffirming his belief that independent regulatory bodies are ""not good for democracy.""

Banning phones in schools should be a decision for head teachers and not ""imposed nationally by the government"", England's children's commissioner has said. Nine in ten secondary schools restrict the use of smartphones, according to a survey of 19,000 schools and colleges commissioned by Dame Rachel de Souza. Dame Rachel said children were racking up hours of screen time at home instead, and that ""the people with the real power here are the parents"". Her comments come as the general secretary of the UK's largest teaching union said a government ban on phones would ""take the pressure off schools"".

Dame Rachel told BBC Radio 5Live that the vast majority schools were already restricting and banning phones, adding: ""Blanket ban if you want, but they're doing it."" The former head teacher cast doubt on how effective a ban would be on those schools without strict policies, noting that the government can impose rules but ""unless a headteacher really believes it, they won't do it properly"". A minority of schools want a ban because they are ""worried about parents"" not supporting the decision, she said. ""That's why I'm saying parents, 'get behind your school'."" Dame Rachel told BBC Breakfast that ""parents have to remember they are not the friends of their children"" but are ""there to protect their children [and] put the boundaries around them.""

Her survey suggests 99.8% of primary and 90% of secondary schools limit pupils' use of phones during the school day. Most primary schools (76%) require pupils to hand in their phones or leave them in a secure place during the day, whereas most secondary schools (79%) say phones must be kept out of sight and not used. The survey did not cover how thoroughly these policies are implemented, or their success rate. A separate survey of 502 eight to 15-year-olds, also commissioned by Dame Rachel, suggests: 69% of children spend more than two hours a day on a device

23% of children spend more than four hours a day

""These children are not spending these hours on their phones while sat in school,"" Dame Rachel said in a new report. She said schools should educate young people about online risks - but parents and carers needed more help to manage their children's online habits and technology companies must ""take responsibility for making the online world safe"". She added that she would back any head teacher's decision to ban phones, but added: ""It should always be their choice, based on their knowledge of what's best for the children in their own classrooms, not a direction imposed nationally by the government."" However, her report also recommended the government should ""conduct more research into the potential benefits of wider restrictions on children's use of phones, particularly social media"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly11270npeo,1

BBC Joe Nihill took his own life after learning on the forum how to buy and use a toxic chemical

A pro-suicide forum is under investigation by the UK's online regulator - its first using new powers under the Online Safety Act. The forum, which Ofcom has not named, is understood to be a site BBC News has been investigating for the last three years, linking it to at least 50 deaths in the UK. The site has tens of thousands of members, including children, and users discuss methods of suicide, sharing instructions about how to buy and use a potentially deadly toxic chemical. Last month, Ofcom gained powers to take action against sites hosting illegal material. This first investigation could lead to fines or court orders against those running the forum.

Families whose loved ones took their own lives after contact with the site have welcomed the move but called on Ofcom to move as quickly as possible.

Family handout Vlad Nikolin-Caisley was encouraged to end his life by members of the forum before he died

Vlad Nikolin-Caisley, from Southampton, died in May last year, aged 17. His parents have evidence that he was coached and encouraged to take his own life by members on the site, which we aren't naming. He bought a poisonous chemical and followed instructions on how to end his life. His parents, Anna and Graham, called on Ofcom to ban the site to save lives. ""At what point do we say enough is enough, because those young people did not deserve to die,"" says Anna. ""The sooner they take action, the sooner we stop deaths linked to this forum,"" agrees Graham.

New powers for authorities

The Online Safety Act became law in October 2023 and Ofcom has spent the last 18 months drawing up guidelines and codes of practice for platforms to follow. On 17 March, Ofcom got powers to take action against sites hosting illegal content, which includes assisting suicide. All websites will now have to show they have systems in place to remove illegal material. If they fail to do so, the regulator can get court orders to block platforms or impose fines of up to £18m. An investigation is the first step before any enforcement action can take place. But Ofcom faces a number of hurdles, including the fact that those running this forum are anonymous and that it is hosted in the US. BBC News has revealed how more than 50 UK suicides have been connected to the forum. In October 2023, the BBC confronted an American man, Lamarcus Small, who is believed to have set the site up in 2018. And in March last year, we also tracked down a poison seller in Ukraine who had been linked to the site. The BBC also joined the forum using a false identity, compiling a list of the dead and exposing a partner section where members could find someone to die with. Catherine Adenekan and daughter-in-law Melanie Saville have been campaigning to have the site shut down since Catherine's son, Joe, took his own life in April 2020.

He was a member of the forum for less than a week, but the 23-year-old learned how to buy and use a toxic chemical. He left a note for his mother which read: ""Please do your best in closing that website for anyone else."" Together they infiltrated the site, documented the numbers of deaths associated with it and identified people selling the chemical. They have been lobbying ministers, their local MP and talking to the media in an effort to get the forum closed down. They say it has been an exhausting five years.

Meta expands Teen Accounts to Facebook and Messenger,"Meta expands restrictions for teen users to Facebook and Messenger

Meta is expanding Teen Accounts - what it considers its age-appropriate experience for under 18s - to Facebook and Messenger. The system involves putting younger teens on the platforms into more restricted settings by default, with parental permission required in order to live stream or turn off image protections for messages. It was first introduced last September on Instagram, which Meta says ""fundamentally changed the experience for teens"" on the platform. But campaigners say it's unclear what difference Teen Accounts has actually made.

""Eight months after Meta rolled out Teen Accounts on Instagram, we've had silence from Mark Zuckerberg about whether this has actually been effective and even what sensitive content it actually tackles,"" said Andy Burrows, chief executive of the Molly Rose Foundation. He added it was ""appalling"" that parents still did not know whether the settings prevented their children being ""algorithmically recommended"" inappropriate or harmful content. Matthew Sowemimo, associate head of policy for child safety online at the NSPCC, said Meta's changes ""must be combined with proactive measures so dangerous content doesn't proliferate on Instagram, Facebook and Messenger in the first place"". But Drew Benvie, chief executive of social media consultancy Battenhall, said it was a step in the right direction. ""For once, big social are fighting for the leadership position not for the most highly engaged teen user base, but for the safest,"" he said. However he also pointed out there was a risk, as with all platforms, that teens could ""find a way around safety settings."" The expanded roll-out of Teen Accounts is beginning in the UK, US, Australia and Canada from Tuesday. Companies that provide services popular with children have faced pressure to introduce parental controls or safety mechanisms to safeguard their experiences. In the UK, they also face legal requirements to prevent children from encountering harmful and illegal content on their platforms, under the Online Safety Act. What the Online Safety Act is - and how to keep your child safe online Roblox recently enabled parents to block specific games or experiences on the hugely popular platform as part of its suite of controls.

What are Teen Accounts?

How Teen Accounts work depend on the self-declared age of the user. Those aged 16 to 18 will be able to toggle off default safety settings like having their account set to private. But 13 to 15 year olds must obtain parental permission to turn off such settings - which can only be done by adding a parent or guardian to their account. Meta says it has moved at least 54 million teens globally into teen accounts since they were introduced in September. It says that 97% of 13 to 15 year olds have also kept its built-in restrictions. The system relies on users being truthful about their age when they set up accounts - with Meta using methods such as video selfies to verify their information. It said in 2024 it would begin using artificial intelligence (AI) to identify teens who might be lying about their age in order to place them back into Teen Accounts. Findings published by the UK media regulator Ofcom in November 2024 suggested that 22% of eight to 17 year olds lie that they are 18 or over on social media apps. Some teenagers told the BBC it was still ""so easy"" to lie about their age on platforms.

"Apple-UK data privacy row should not be secret, court rules","Apple's encryption row with UK should not be secret, court rules

7 April 2025 Share Save Tom Singleton & Liv McMahon Technology reporters Share Save

A judge has sided with a coalition of civil liberties groups and news organisations - including the BBC - and ruled a legal row between the UK government and Apple over data privacy cannot be held in secret. The Home Office wants the right to be able access information secured by Apple's Advanced Data Protection (ADP) system, citing powers given to it under the Investigatory Powers Act. At the moment Apple has no such capability - such data can only be accessed by the user - and says it does not want to create what it calls a ""backdoor"" into ADP because of concerns it would eventually be exploited by hackers and criminals. The government's request prompted fierce criticism from privacy campaigners and some US politicians.

In February, Apple pulled ADP from the UK and in March it launched legal proceedings against the government, in a case which is being heard by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal. The government argued it would damage national security if the nature of the legal action and the parties to it were made public - what are known as the ""bare details of the case"". In a ruling published on Monday morning, the tribunal rejected that request - pointing to the extensive media reporting of the row and highlighting the legal principle of open justice. ""It would have been a truly extraordinary step to conduct a hearing entirely in secret without any public revelation of the fact that a hearing was taking place,"" it states. ""For the reasons that are set out in our private judgement, we do not accept that the revelation of the bare details of the case would be damaging to the public interest or prejudicial to national security,"" it later adds. In a statement the Home Office said it would not comment on legal proceedings or individual notices but said its ""first priority is to keep people safe."" ""There are longstanding and targeted investigatory powers that allow the authorities to investigate terrorists, paedophiles and the most serious criminals and they are subject to robust safeguards including judicial authorisations and oversight to protect people's privacy,"" it added. It stressed it was not seeking blanket data access - and any requests to view individual accounts protected by ADP would need a court approved warrant.

Wider implications

Civil and digital rights organisations in the UK, which criticised the Home Office request, have welcomed Monday's ruling. They, along with news organisations - including the BBC - made legal representations for the case to be heard in public. ""This is bigger than the UK and Apple,"" said Jim Killock, executive director of Open Rights Group. ""The Court's judgment will have implications for the privacy and security of millions of people around the world."" The Open Rights Group campaigned alongside Big Brother Watch and Index on Censorship against the proposal to hold the hearing in secret. Big Brother Watch interim director Rebecca Vincent says the judgement is ""effectively chipping away at the pervasive climate of secrecy surrounding the Investigatory Powers Tribunal's consideration of the Apple case"". ""The Home Office's order to break encryption represents a massive attack on the privacy rights of millions of British Apple users, which is a matter of significant public interest and must not be considered behind closed doors,"" she adds. Apple declined to comment. In a previous statement it told the BBC: ""Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom. ""As we have said many times before we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.""

US President Donald Trump has granted TikTok a second 75-day extension to comply with a law that requires the hugely popular video app to either sell its US operation or face a ban in the country. ""We do not want TikTok to 'go dark',"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal."" The platform is currently owned by Chinese company ByteDance. Trump's first extension was granted after he took office in January and was set to expire on Saturday. The social media platform, which says it has more than 170 million users in the US, must close in the US under a law passed by Congress - unless a buyer is found.

In a statement on Friday, ByteDance said it had been in discussion with the Trump administration, but ""an agreement has not been executed"". ""There are key matters to be resolved. Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law,"" a spokesperson said. Former US President Joe Biden's administration had argued that TikTok could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation. Congress passed a bipartisan law last year that gave ByteDance six months to sell its controlling stake in TikTok or see the app blocked in the US. Opponents of a ban have cited freedom of speech as a reason for keeping the platform open. The new extension comes as the Trump administration tries to broker a deal to bring the social media platform under American ownership, and keep the popular app running in the US. ""The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed,"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Friday. Who might buy TikTok as ban deadline looms? Amazon joins bidders A TikTok deal was reportedly nearly finalised on Wednesday, but fell apart after Trump on the same day announced sweeping global tariffs, including on China. ByteDance representatives contacted the White House to inform them China would no longer approve the deal unless negotiations on the tariffs could take place, a source familiar with the deal told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. The unnamed source said the plan had been for Trump to sign an order initiating a 120-day period for closing the deal, allowing time to finish paperwork and secure financing. The agreement had won approval from existing investors, new investors, ByteDance, and the US government, but China backed out once Trump imposed the global import taxes, CBS reports. The Chinese embassy in Washington DC said in a statement that it ""opposed practices that violate the basic principles of the market economy"".

President Donald Trump has for a second time extended the deadline that would have required TikTok to be sold or face a ban in the US. A bipartisan law passed by Congress last year mandates TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, sell the app. The platform 'went dark' for a day in January in the US after the law took effect, until Trump intervened and delayed the ban until 5 April. He has now granted a another 75-day extension until June broker a deal. The US government has said TikTok poses a threat to national security because Chinese authorities might access its vast trove of user data, which Beijing denies.

Who might buy TikTok?

Speaking on Air Force One on Thursday, Trump said ""multiple investors"" were closing in on a deal. He also suggested the US could offer a deal where China agrees to approve a TikTok sale in exchange for relief from US tariffs on Chinese imports. Several potential buyers have cropped up in reports. Amazon has put in a last-minute offer to the White House to acquire TikTok, according to the BBC's US partner CBS. Amazon declined to comment. Trump has said he would be open to selling TikTok to Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, as well as Elon Musk, although the latter said he had no intention of buying. Other potential buyers include billionaire Frank McCourt, together with Canadian businessman Kevin O'Leary - a celebrity investor on Shark Tank, the US version of Dragons' Den. Alexis Ohanian, who co-founded Reddit, said in a post on X last month that he had joined Mr McCourt's bid. The biggest YouTuber in the world Jimmy Donaldson - AKA MrBeast - has also said he's looking to buy TikTok as part of a group of investors. Tim Stokely, the British founder of OnlyFans, has also to offered to buy TikTok under his recently re-launched company, Zoop. Computing giant Microsoft, private equity giant Blackstone, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and search engine Perplexity AI are also reportedly in the running for a stake. The White House has reportedly considered an option whereby ByteDance would keep ownership of TikTok's algorithm, but lease it to a new entity operating the video-sharing app within the US.

If there is no deal, will TikTok be banned?

If no deal is reached by 5 April, the app could once again face a US ban and be pulled from app stores. Trump signed an executive order in January, which only delayed TikTok's ban by 75 days. His order did not overturn the ban on the app passed into law by Congress and upheld by the US Supreme Court. Trump could allow the law to stand, but ask the Department of Justice to continue to ignore it. The government would effectively be telling Apple and Google they will not be punished for allowing people to download TikTok on to their devices. TikTok returned to Google's Play Store and Apple's App Store in February, after the companies were reportedly told they would not face consequences for hosting it. Trump has also said he would ""probably"" extend the deadline, if needed .

Instagram's owner Meta and Pinterest have made significant donations to a charity set up in the name of 14-year-old Molly Russell, the BBC understands. Molly, from Harrow in northwest London, took her own life in 2017 after being exposed to a stream of suicide and self-harm content on the two platforms. A coroner concluded the negative effects of online material contributed to her death. The donations are thought to have gone to the Molly Rose Foundation, which campaigns for internet safety. Meta and Pinterest declined to comment. Molly's family said they had decided not to take legal action against the tech companies and would ""never accept compensation"" over Molly's death.

In a statement via their solicitor, the family said that they would ""pursue the aims we share with Meta and Pinterest through the Molly Rose Foundation to help ensure young people have a positive experience online"".

RUSSELL FAMILY Molly Russell's inquest heard that social media algorithms had fed her thousands of pictures and videos relating to suicide and self-harm

Meta and other social media companies face multiple lawsuits in the US from families who claim their children were harmed by social media. The cases also involve attorneys general from more than 40 states, who claim that the design of the platforms caused harm to children. The first trial is expected to be heard in November.

Details of payments to the Molly Rose Foundation have not been publicly disclosed. Rose was Molly's middle name. The charity's annual report states: ""The Molly Rose Foundation has received grants from donors that wish to remain anonymous. Having considered their obligations, the Trustees have agreed to respect these wishes."" The BBC believes that this refers to the payments to the charity from the two social media companies. These payments started in 2024 and are expected to be paid over a number of years. It's not known exactly when any agreement over donations was reached.

Within the last nine months the charity has recruited a CEO, two public policy managers, a head of communications and a fundraising manager. Asked about the donations, the charity repeated in a statement that it would ""respect these wishes"" for anonymity. It is understood that no members of the Russell family have received any money from the donation. After approaching the family's solicitor, a statement was released saying: ""Following the coroner's inquest into Molly's death, we have decided that we will pursue the aims we share with Meta and Pinterest through the Molly Rose Foundation to help ensure young people have a positive experience online, instead of pursuing legal action. We, Molly's family, have always made clear that we would never accept compensation consequent upon Molly's death.""

PA Media Ian Russell, Molly's father, has spoken widely about the dangers of unregulated social media and has been made an MBE for services to child safety online

The Molly Rose Foundation has become a leading voice in highlighting the dangers of unregulated social media and remains highly critical of Meta. It has called on the government to strengthen the existing Online Safety Act with more robust legislation. It is not calling for a children's social media ban, as planned in Australia, but is demanding that technology companies take more responsibility for the content channelled to young people through social media algorithms. In March this year, in association with publisher Pan Macmillan, the charity sent a copy of a book written by Facebook whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams to every MP in the country. In it Ms Wynn-Williams, who used to be the company's global public policy director, makes a series of critical claims about what she witnessed during her seven years at Facebook.

Molly's father Ian Russell is an unpaid trustee of the foundation and remains an outspoken campaigner.

Nintendo

Nintendo has been the talk of the gaming world this week after it finally unveiled details of the much-anticipated Nintendo Switch 2, the sequel to the third-best selling console ever made. Despite excitement over its upcoming launch in June, fan conversations have been dominated by one topic - the price of its games. The console itself is priced similarly to its rivals - Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X. But the games are a different story: Mario Kart World, which is being launched alongside the Switch 2, comes in at £74.99. ""It makes it inaccessible, it's a lot to drop on one game,"" said Chloe Crossan, one of several gamers the BBC spoke to at a gaming store in Glasgow.

She told the BBC she was excited about the console and its various games, but was concerned about the cost involved. ""I guess you could argue you're paying for a game that four people could play,"" she said. ""So there is that element - but it is £75 for a game which is a lot."" It's not expected that all of the Switch 2's titles will be so expensive - but charging so much for its best-known game still represents a big change in Nintendo's pricing strategy. It also risks confusing customers, as the same games can be purchased for different amounts depending on whether they are buying the physical game or the digital-only version.

Experts don't think Mario Kart World will be a one off. Christopher Dring, editor-in-chief and co-founder of The Game Business, said he expected to see price rises elsewhere too - particularly for the most anticipated titles, such as the latest edition of the Grand Theft Auto franchise. ""I think if you're going see a game that's going to be able to charge more, look out for when GTA 6 gets a release date later in the year,"" he said. He says there are lots of reasons prices might go up, part of which is that modern games are a lot of work. ""These games are taking longer to make, they require more people to make them,"" he said. But there's also the fact, he says, that video game prices have not kept up with inflation. ""I bought N64 games for £50 in the turn of the century and that's £80 today,"" he pointed out. For some time developers have got round that by monetising transactions in games and relying more on cheaper digital downloads. But that process, Mr Dring says, is running out of road. ""That growth has started to slow, so they're now relying on price increases.""

But it's clear those kinds of prices won't put everyone off. Another gamer the BBC spoke to, Kathryn Brown, said she and her family were excited about the Switch 2 - even if it was ""more expensive than usual"". ""If it gets good reviews, and I wait until people have bought it first, then we'll think about it,"" she said.

Kathryn said she has two daughters at home who are both excited for the console

And Lewis Tocher - who's had the original Switch since the day it launched - said he would get the console as soon as he could afford it, despite the cost of the games. But he said considering the cost of game development nowadays, he was ""surprised"" it hadn't gone up in price sooner.

But what will retailers make of it? Mr Dring told the BBC this was the first time a console's physical and digital games were being priced differently. He said that could be a real blow for the people who sell the physical games. ""When a Nintendo Switch game releases, around 80% of its sales are in a box - if you compare that to Xbox, around 80% of new game sales are digital. ""By charging more for the physical copy it's going to encourage people to download more, which will be good for Nintendo's bottom line."" But of course it will be worse for the retailers who miss out on sales of the physical game.

Some users have complained about confusion caused by parody accounts on the platform, such as those impersonating its owner Elon Musk.

The platform will also require parody account holders to use different images to the X accounts belonging to those they seek to represent.

From 10 April, accounts which impersonate another user or person must use key words such as ""fake"" or ""parody"" at the start of their account names.

X is bringing in stricter rules around parody accounts.

""These changes are designed to help users better understand the unaffiliated nature of PCF accounts and reduce the risk of confusion or impersonation,"" the company said in a post on Saturday.

It encouraged affected accounts to update their profiles by the enforcement date.

The changes will also apply for fan and commentary accounts, it said.

""Hopefully this includes all the thousands of fake variations of Elon Musk accounts,"" wrote one user in response to X's post about its policy update.

""About time, I get a fake Elon account contacting me almost once a week,"" wrote another.

There are a number of parody accounts for the platform's owner, identifying themselves as impersonations in various ways.

Posts viewed by the BBC from Elon Musk parody accounts ranged from memes and jokes, to promoting cryptocurrency and car giveaways.

A recent post by one Elon Musk parody account, which has more than one million followers, told users to ""like and comment"" for the chance to win a Tesla.

The post has received 428,000 likes and more than 200,000 replies.

X rolled out labels for parody accounts in January - building on its rules requiring users engaging in impersonation for the purpose of entertainment to identify themselves as such.

These, and the platform's blue tick verification system, have been cited as tools to prevent misleading impersonation while allowing speech and discussion.

But the effectiveness of such measures have been disputed.

The EU said in July 2024 that the blue ticks breached its online content rules, with its ""verified"" blue tick accounts having the potential to ""deceive"" users.

Musk called the EU's rules ""misinformation"", in response.

Following his takeover in November 2022, the Tesla chief executive said accounts engaging in unlabelled impersonation would be banned.

Many parody accounts on X identify their parody nature in brackets at the end of user names, but this is not a fool-proof measure.

If a parody account's name is particularly long, and only a shortened version appears in feeds or replies, users can unwittingly duped - especially if the account's image matches that of the real person.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g37elkrxdo,1

After months of speculation, Nintendo has confirmed the successor to its wildly popular Switch console will be released on 5 June, when it will cost £395.99 to buy in the UK. But it's not so much the price of the Switch 2 but its games that have been raising eyebrows, with the new Mario Kart World that is being released alongside it coming in at a whopping £74.99 for a physical copy. Fans will have to wait weeks before seeing what the new console and game are like - and whether they are worth that sort of money - but here's what I found when Nintendo gave me a chance to try them both out. When I first got my hands on the Switch 2, one thing became very clear to me - like the name suggests, Nintendo wants you to know this is a direct sequel to the Switch. This isn't like the jump from the Wii to the confusingly named Wii U, swapping motion controllers for a tablet that looked dated even back when the console released. Instead, the Switch 2 looks and feels just like its predecessor, with buttons in the places you'd expect - and a much larger (and nicer) screen.

What's it like to play?

It's fair to say Mario Kart World makes a fantastic first impression, thanks to the console having more power under the hood. It looks spectacular compared to previous Switch titles, though we're still talking about cartoony graphics - make no mistake, the console is more powerful but it's no match for the higher spec PlayStation 5, let alone PS5 Pro. And in my three races the standout feature wasn't the swishy new graphics or the controller, it was a trick that is becoming Nintendo's hallmark: making the new feel familiar. Despite having never picked up a Switch 2, I stormed my way to consecutive first place finishes, much to the chagrin of those around me.

But it doesn't come cheap. The digital version of the game costs £66.99, it's another £8 on top of that for a physical copy - or pay an extra £35 for a version of the Switch 2 with it built-in, something which pushes the console price to £429.99. According to industry expert Christopher Dring, these wallet-emptying prices are down to the costs involved in manufacturing - and President Donald Trump's tariff blitz. “These cartridges are exclusively made in Japan, which is a country that's just been hit with a 24% tariff from the US Government, and the threat of those tariffs may have impacted Nintendo's pricing decisions globally,” he said. In the US, Mario Kart World will be priced at $79.99, with the console selling for $449.99 (or $499.99 with Mario Kart bundled in).

Mouse control and Donkey Kong destruction

But there’s more to the Switch 2 than Mario Kart. Fans will no doubt have been excited to see the hotly anticipated Metroid Prime 4, the first game in the series in 18 years. But while they will be familiar with the typical way of playing - moving and aiming with joysticks and shooting with the ""A"" button - there’s a significant new feature too. At any point in the game you can rotate the controller, put it on a surface and use it like a mouse. Fans of PC games will immediately feel at home with this, and it's a neat bit of engineering to be able to switch up on-the-fly without having to enter any menus.

The mouse controls were intuitive - with my thumb oddly feeling quite natural on the thumbstick while moving the mouse around

The optical mouse controls pop up elsewhere too, with PC strategy game Civilization VII a game that massively benefits. But in both cases, I do wonder how long you can play with the controller like this before the ergonomics become an issue. I have to admit I found myself wondering why I wasn't just playing on my PC with mouse controls and a comfortable resting position. Still, the fact that this is built in to the hardware means we may see the Switch 2 as the obvious home of future PC ports to home consoles. And there is another trick up Nintendo’s sleeve - both controllers can be held like this and used as mice, opening up some interesting possibilities. In particular, futuristic wheelchair basketball game Drag x Drive, where both ""mice"" are pushed to mimic moving wheels. Elsewhere, Donkey Kong Bananza will be the first time the ape mascot has had a 3D platforming game of his own in 25 years, so there was some pressure on Nintendo to deliver a game which justified the wait.

Keen-eyed Nintendo fans will notice Donkey Kong has had a makeover, with a much friendlier face and softened eyebrows

For lack of a better term it’s a destruct-em-up - you can destroy much of the floor and scenery in each level. But there's that dreaded price news again. A digital copy will cost £58.99, while a physical copy retails at £66.99. It seems Nintendo has a lot to offer Switch fans - but it will be taking a fair bit from them too.

Rivals and originals

Some other titles I got to see in action were updated versions of Cyberpunk 2077 and Yakuza 0 - both of which big hitters on rival consoles which were deemed too complex to run on the original Switch. Like the other Switch 2 games, they looked good - and of course they will benefit as the new console, like the original, can play games on the go. The original Switch created the genre of the hybrid console - one which works on a TV and as a portable system. But since that launch in 2017, things have changed a bit. Now, it has a rival in the Steam Deck, a hybrid machine with the power to play most PC games. Nintendo would say something its rivals don’t have is that long list of exclusive titles. But there is a bit of a theme here: Nintendo has consciously gone for continuity. The console is the Switch 2, rather than having a completely new name. Many of those exclusives Nintendo is so proud of are new games in established series, while others are remasters of modern classics.

Buyers circle and rumours swirl as TikTok sale deadline looms,"Vance confident TikTok will be sold in US as deadline looms

The list of would-be buyers for TikTok in the US - both rumoured and confirmed - has grown longer as the deadline for deciding its future looms.

The social media giant faces being shut down in the US unless it sells to an American company by 5 April.

The runners and riders range from US tech giants to the British entrepreneur dubbed ""the king of homemade porn"".

However, TikTok and its Chinese owner, ByteDance have still not confirmed they are willing to do a deal.

They also continue to reject the reason for the sale - that the US considers their ties to the Chinese government a national security threat.

It is also not clear what exactly would be sold, in particular what would happen to TikTok's algorithim, which decides what content to expose users to, and is considered a big reason for its success.

""TikTok without its algorithm is like Harry Potter without his wand - it's simply not as powerful,"" said Kelsey Chickering, principal analyst at Forrester Research.

Despite all this uncertainty, Ms Chickering said it was unlikely the app would go offline in the US as it briefly did in January.

""It is highly unlikely that TikTok will go dark again. All signs point to a deal or another extension.""

Vice President JD Vance told Fox News on Thursday that the Trump administration was set to announce a deal ahead of the Saturday deadline.

Every year, journalist Ben Black publishes a playful fake story on his community news site Cwmbran Life for April Fools' Day. Since 2018 the 48-year-old has spun yarns including a Hollywood-style sign on a mountain to a nudist cold-water swimming club at a lake. In 2020, Mr Black published a fake story claiming Cwmbran had been recognised by Guinness World Records for having the most roundabouts per square kilometre. Despite altering the wording of his article that afternoon, when he searched for it on 1 April he said he was ""shocked"" and ""worried"" to find the false information being used by Google's AI tool and presented as real information. Google said it was looking into the matter.

Mr Black decided to begin writing fake stories for April Fools' Day for ""a bit of fun"" and said his wife usually helped him come up with the ideas. The concept for his story in 2020 came from Cwmbran being a new town, where ""often linking houses with roundabouts is the easiest way to build"". ""I made up a number for the roundabouts per square kilometre and added a fake quote from a resident and clicked publish. ""It went down really well from memory, people laughed,"" he said. That afternoon, Mr Black marked the story as an April Fools' prank to clarify it was not fake news to his readers. However, the next day, he was ""annoyed"" to find it had been picked up by a larger national news website without his permission, and despite efforts to try and get the story removed, the story is still online.

He said: ""It's really scary that someone in Scotland could Google 'roads in Wales' and come across a story that just isn't true.

Tesla sales have plummeted to their lowest level in three years after a backlash against its boss Elon Musk. The electric car maker delivered almost 337,000 electric vehicles in the first three months of 2025, a 13% drop from a year ago. Tesla shares tumbled in early trading on Wednesday after the release of the low sales numbers. The cars face increasing competition from Chinese firm BYD, but experts believe Musk's controversial role in the Trump administration has had an effect too.

The firm has blamed the sales drop on the transition to a new version of its most popular car. However some analysts have pointed the finger at Musk himself. ""These numbers suck,"" early Tesla investor Ross Gerber of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management wrote on X. ""The brand is broken and may not be fixable"", added Mr Gerber, who was once a Musk supporter but has recently called for the board to remove the billionaire as CEO.

'Tesla takedown'

There have been protests and boycotts around the world prompted by Musk's outspoken and controversial political involvement. He has been heading up President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative to cut federal spending and slash the government workforce. On Wednesday, Politico reported that Trump had told his inner circle Musk would be stepping back from the administration in the coming weeks. Shortly after the report was published, Tesla's share price turned positive. The White House shot down the report as ""garbage"". Because he is considered a special government employee, Musk by law can only serve 130 days in the administration this year, which would put his departure closer to June. The Tesla boss is the world's richest man and contributed more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help Trump get elected in November. In recent weeks, he poured millions into a Wisconsin Supreme Court race, supporting former Republican attorney general Brad Schimel who was soundly defeated on Tuesday.

Nintendo Nintendo icon Mario is back in a new Mario Kart game

Nintendo has revealed the Switch 2, the long awaited successor to one of the best-selling consoles in history, will be released on 5 June. Fans have been impatiently waiting to find out more since January, when the Japanese gaming giant ended months of speculation by confirming basic information about the new device. In a Nintendo Direct online presentation, watched by more than a million people, it gave further details of the hardware, as well as confirming it would be accompanied by Mario Kart World, a new edition of Nintendo's most famous game. It also announced a series of other new titles for the console, including Elden Ring and Street Fighter 6. The company said the new device would have better graphics and audio than its predecessor, and a chat button allowing players to speak to each other while playing. The price will vary in different markets but in the UK it will retail at £395, or £429 with Mario Kart.

Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa called the new console ""a leap forward"", eight years after the release of the original Switch.

Mario Kart, Donkey Kong and Kirby return

As well as huge interest in the device itself, fans have been keen to find out what games they will be able to play on it. Most eye-catching was Mario Kart World - in which the franchise appears to have been given a significant refresh. Water graphics, character tweaks, big sprawling race tracks seen from a distance with varying weather and climates - Nintendo is firmly showing fans this console has more under the hood than its predecessor.

The firm also showcased the platforming adventure Donkey Kong Bananza and Kirby Air Riders, a sequel to a fan favourite game released back in 2005 - both coming later this year. Nintendo also confirmed that ""compatible"" Switch games will work on the Switch 2. Others will get Switch 2 editions, meaning they will have updated graphics and gameplay. On the Nintendo Store website, the digital versions of Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza are priced at £66.99 and £58.99 respectively. The physical versions are both £8 more expensive.

The Duskbloods and other games announced

The games made by third party developers - such as Elden Ring - are notable too because some are the kind of high-profile games that typically have not come to Nintendo consoles in recent years. They include: Cyberpunk 2077

Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade

Hitman World of Assassination

Hades 2

Hollow Knight: Silksong Elden Ring developer FromSoftware also revealed a new multiplayer game - The Duskbloods - as a Switch 2 exclusive coming in 2026.

Mouse, camera and chat function

The console itself has a bigger screen than its predecessor at 7.9 inches, with a better display - 1080p compared to the Switch's 720p, with HDR support and showing up to 120fps. Marginal changes - such as larger buttons and control sticks - will get attention. But more interesting is that both controls can be used as a mouse, as with a PC, in supported games. Nintendo argues its 3D audio tech will create a surround sound experience, but this is unlikely to be the feature that sways people to picking up the device. 256GB of internal storage is a big upgrade, as Nintendo has historically been stingy on this front. The C button on the switch controller is the new bit of hardware for the Switch 2. It appears to help control a voice chat feature which is built into the system. Players pop up at the bottom of the screen, appearing almost like Zoom or Teams - complete with a quite low frame rate screen share - and Nintendo claims its tech will isolate your voice regardless of background noise.

Getty Images Roblox is one of the world's largest games platforms, with more monthly users than Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation combined. In 2024 it averaged more than 80 million players per day - roughly 40% of them below the age of 13.

Parents will be able to block their children from specific games and experiences on Roblox as part of new safety measures announced by the hugely popular gaming platform. They will also be able to block or report their children's friends, and the platform will provide more information about which games young users are playing. The measures will only apply to children who are under the age of 13 and have parental controls set up on their accounts. The announcements comes after the CEO of Roblox, Dave Baszucki told the BBC that parents should keep their children off the platform if they were ""not comfortable"" with it.

Roblox - the most popular site in the UK for gamers aged eight to 12 - has been dogged by claims that some children are being exposed to explicit or harmful content through its games. However, in his BBC interview, Mr Baszucki stressed that the company was vigilant about protecting its users, with ""tens of millions"" of people having ""amazing"" experiences on Roblox. Announcing the latest safety features, Roblox's Chief Safety Officer Matt Kaufman said: ""These tools, features, and innovations reflect our mission to make Roblox the safest and most civil online platform in the world."" A spokesperson for the regulator, Ofcom, said the measures were ""encouraging"", but added ""tech companies will have to do a lot more in the coming months to protect children online"".

'Shoot down planes'

In preparation for the interview with Mr Baszucki, the BBC found a range of game titles with troubling titles that had been recommended to an 11-year-old on the platform. They included games such as ""Late Night Boys And Girls Club RP"" and ""Shoot down planes…because why not?"" Parents with linked accounts of children who are 12 and under can now block such titles if they are uncomfortable with them. They will also be able to go further in managing who their children are friends with. They can already view their child's friends list - now they can block or report people on that list, preventing them exchanging direct messages. Messaging between children had already been restricted in measures announced in November last year. Additionally, parents will now be able to see the top games their child played on Roblox over the last week and how long they spent in each one.

What do parents think?

Sally, from the north of Scotland, told the BBC last month that her nine-year-old daughter was groomed on the platform in December last year. Despite reporting it to Roblox, she never received a response. She welcomed the announcements as a ""start"", but said Roblox ""needs to do better"". She added: ""What's missing is proper authentication of users. How does the company know that users are who they say they are - how will perpetrators be traced when grooming keeps happening?"" Roblox highlighted to BBC News its community standards, which have a zero-tolerance policy for the exploitation of minors. Amir from Leeds told the BBC last month that his 15-year-old son is ""addicted"" to Roblox, and can use the site for up to 14 hours a day. He has welcomed the changes announced today for younger users, but wants the platform itself to do more and target the availability of inappropriate games for children.

People who spend more time looking at a screen in bed are more likely to report insomnia and sleep loss, a study has found. The research is based on a Norwegian survey of more than 45,000 students. It indicates that each additional hour of screen time was linked to a 63% increase in insomnia risk, and 24 minutes less sleep. However, the researchers said they had only established a correlation between screen use and lower sleep quality and had not demonstrated that the former caused the latter. Experts say putting down your phone before bed, doing something relaxing and establishing a routine may help improve sleep. Why you should go to sleep at the same time all week

The researchers behind the study, based on nationally representative survey data of 18-28 year old students gathered in 2022, wanted to examine the link between the amount of time spent using screens in bed and sleep patterns. They also sought to probe the impact on sleep of using social media compared to other screen activities. Dr Gunnhild Johnsen Hjetland of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, who is lead author of the research - which was published in a Frontiers journal - said the type of screen activity appeared to be less impactful than screen time on the whole. ""We found no significant differences between social media and other screen activities, suggesting that screen use itself is the key factor in sleep disruption,"" he said.

Sleep or social media

The 2022 Norway health and wellbeing survey asked participants to identify if they used any digital media after they had gone to bed. Options included watching films or TV, checking social media, browsing the internet and gaming. Among those saying they used screens in bed before sleep, 69% said they used social media as well as other screen-based activities. Participants were also asked to identify how many nights a week they would engage with such media, and for how much time, as well as how often they had difficultly falling or staying asleep, waking up early or experiencing tiredness. It identified those who said they experienced such issues at least three nights or days a week, for at least three months as experiencing insomnia. While the study found a link between bedtime screen use and people reporting sleep disruption or insomnia, researchers say it does not mean it is a cause. ""This study cannot determine causality — for example, whether screen use causes insomnia or if students with insomnia use screens more,"" said Dr Hjetland. They also note that the study's reliance on survey data of self-reported experiences may mean it contains biases, and its findings should not be considered globally representative. Joshua Piper, a sleep clinician at ResMed UK, said the study provided ""valuable, mounting evidence"" of electronic device use negatively impacting sleep. ""It steals both opportunity and the quality of your sleep, which is why some may struggle for onset, others struggle to stay asleep,"" he told the BBC. While people may try to mitigate the impact by adjusting screen brightness or using night mode, Mr Piper said previous studies suggested it was scrolling and engaging with a device that was likely to cause sleep disruptions.

In an X post Friday, Musk said the all-stock transaction values xAI at $80bn (£61.8bn) and X at ""$33billion ($45B less $12B debt)"" Musk added.

Elon Musk says that his AI venture xAI has acquired his social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.

The move may be aimed at protecting investors, who helped him buy X, from losing money.

Both X and xAI are privately held and share some major investors. They also share significant resources.

""The combined company will deliver smarter, more meaningful experiences to billions of people while staying true to our core mission of seeking truth and advancing knowledge,"" Musk wrote.

XAI has used data from social media posts on X to train its models, and its chatbot Grok is a prominent feature on the platform.

""The move appears sensible, considering the current trend of increased investments in AI, data centres, and computing,"" said analyst Paolo Pescatore, founder of PP Foresight.

Mr Musk has been locked in a legal battle with OpenAI, the company he founded in 2015 with CEO Sam Altman.

Last year, Mr Musk sued OpenAI and Mr. Altman for straying from the company's original mission and pushing to transition the startup to a for-profit model.

On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that OpenAI was finalizing a $40bn funding round with the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank. The outlet also reported the funds are contingent on the company completing its restructuring to a for-profit entity.

OpenAI did not respond to a BBC inquiry about the arrangement.

Critics say Mr Musk is suing the ChatGPT makers because he wanted to control it.

Earlier this year, a consortium led by Mr Musk made an unsolicited $97.4bn takeover bid for OpenAI, which Mr Altman rejected, saying the company is not for sale.

The business manoeuvring is happening as Mr Musk has taken more of an interest in politics, now serving as President Donald Trump's right-hand.

Wikipedia is one of the most visited websites in the world but, by the admission of some of its own volunteer editors, it suffers from a persistent problem - terrible pictures, particularly of celebrities. It is so full of notable people with very old or unflattering photographs that there are even Instagram accounts dedicated to the very worst ones. The problem arises because professional photographers who attend, for example, film premieres tend to work for big agencies: their work is copyrighted and you usually need to pay to reproduce it. Wikipedia - which is largely sustained by volunteers - does not have a budget for that. Some enthusiasts launched WikiPortraits, a project to recruit a group of volunteer photographers around the world and get them accreditation to attend film festivals, conferences and other events. ""Wikipedia has for the longest time had missing or poor quality photos of people,"" said Kevin Payravi, one of the project's founders. ""This issue has always been in the back of our minds as Wikipedia editors."" He spoke to the BBC from Austin, Texas where he and fellow founder Jennifer 8. Lee were covering the SXSW festival, complete with their own photo booth for set-up portraits. ""Some people are super bothered by the terrible photos on Wikipedia, and want to save the world from them as well,"" Ms Lee said. ""The bad photos are so funny - there are some amazing blobs of humans there.""

Wikipedia Emil Wakim's Wikipedia image was removed because it was so bad

Wikipedia has strict rules for photography and copyright, so the pictures uploaded must be a contributor's own, freely licensed or in the public domain. As a result it contains many images added by enthusiasts rather than taken by photographers. In some cases that merely means a non-descript image - but sometimes they are much worse than that. A prime example: the comedian Emil Wakim, of Saturday Night Live fame. For a week last November, the photo above - apparently taken at a stand-up show in New York - was his Wikipedia picture. When it was removed, an editor noted ""having no picture is better than what's currently there"". The photo of the English footballer Kyle Bartley, taken in 2011, has also been highlighted by social media users as evidence of Wikipedia's picture problem.

WikiPortraits started its work at the beginning of 2024. The photographers are not paid and most are based in the US, but there are volunteers across the world. Jennifer and Kevin say their photographers tend to be Wikipedia enthusiasts, photography hobbyists, and professionals keen to build their portfolios. So far, 55 of them have done work for WikiPortraits, or are committed to doing so. Bryan Berlin is one of the photographers.

""Having a better photo of someone gives better information for somebody who is accessing Wikipedia,"" he told the BBC.

One of his favourite experiences with a celebrity was with Lord of the Rings star Elijah Wood. ""He was just such a kind person, and said it was so cool that we were doing this.""

The Edinburgh festival, Cannes and the Nobel prizes are some of the events covered so far, and the project says its photographs are viewed around 100 million times a month. Some of the biggest names in entertainment now have a WikiPortraits image as their Wikipedia picture. While those pictures attract attention, the project is also proud to have taken photos of people, such as under-represented filmmakers, who had no Wikipedia picture at all.

Frank Sun is a filmmaker and cinematography who does photography as a hobby. His work on WikiPortraits includes pictures of Florence Pugh and Ben Stiller. Also based in New York, he has taken pictures at Cannes, Sundance, and the Toronto film festivals. He fondly remembers an experience with Laetitia Dosch, the French actress, writer and director. ""She said 'my photo is terrible, it is from years ago. I am so excited to update as any time people search for me, it is an old photo'. ""I think she was pleased.""

Center Parcs removes X link from site after fake account set up,"Center Parcs removes X account from website after fake account set up

Center Parcs removed the link after being contacted by BBC News, and conceded the links ""should have been removed"" from its website when it stopped using X.

Carl Lennon, an IT consultant, registered an X account with this name when he noticed it was available, and said he started getting messages from customers asking to change their bookings.

Center Parcs deleted its X account in January, which meant the @CenterParcsUK handle became available.

The holiday park company Center Parcs has removed links to its old X account from its website after a man who took over the account was contacted by genuine customers.

""Center Parcs recently deactivated our X channel as it was no longer deemed an effective channel for us to use and our guests have several other ways to talk directly to us,"" a spokesperson told the BBC.

Mr Lennon was looking to book a holiday with Center Parcs but changed his mind after he discovered the company was still linking to the dead X account from its website.

""I was effectively thinking of handing over my data to them to do a booking, and thinking, 'Well, hang on, they don't seem to have very good security,'"" he said.

Companies often use social media accounts as a form of customer support, where people will message them for help.

He has had requests from customers on a range of topics, including requests to change dates, rearrange payments, and add more people to bookings.

""I don't know the legality of replying to their messages,"" he said, adding he has decided not to reply at all and only took on the handle as an experiment.

But he said ""someone malicious"" could easily respond, asking customers to send payment details or other sensitive information to the X account.

Mr Lennon says he tried contacting Center Parcs through various channels but had not been able to get a response, except for an acknowledgement of an email he had sent.

After being told by BBC News that the link had been removed, he said ""they didn't seem to take it seriously"" when he contacted them three weeks ago.

""I'm just a bit gobsmacked that it took them so long to sort out,"" he said.

He said he will now deactivate the X account altogether.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyjyj9lnryo,1
Rocket League: Do home crowds make a difference in esports?,"'UK crowds are the best': Does home advantage make a difference in esports?

29 March 2025 Share Save Andrew Rogers BBC Newsbeat Share Save

RLCS Fans at last year's RLCS competition in London

Conventional wisdom tells us professional athletes perform best in front of a home crowd. Great Britain's Olympic team won a record medal haul at London 2012 and England's Lionesses won the Euros at Wembley in 2022, 56 years after the men's national football team won the World Cup at home. Does that same home advantage apply in esports? BBC Newsbeat asked four competitors at this weekend's Rocket League Championship Series in Birmingham to find out. Players compete in the popular online game by driving cars around an arena, trying to push an oversized ball into the opposing team's goal. The event brings 16 of the world's top teams together to compete for a prize pot of more than £270,000 ($350,000).

RLCS Finlay now lives and plays in Saudi Arabia, but grew up in Manchester

While millions watch esports online, most fans say there's nothing like being in the arena with the roar of the crowd. Finlay, 20, from Manchester, says it's one reason UK events stand out in the international calendar. ""I think UK crowds are always the best,"" he says, explaining that they're more creative in their chanting, and make more noise than American spectators. Finlay thinks that could be down to our affection for another sport. ""Football's ingrained into UK culture,"" he says. And, similar to real-life sport, crowds aren't afraid to play favourites. ""I think as an English player the crowd will always get behind their own,"" he says. On top of that, his parents will be coming along to watch too. ""It's going to be a good weekend,"" he says.

RLCS Joe won first place at the 2022 Spring London Major

Joe, from Workington, agrees that having the crowd behind you can help but doesn't feel like it changes that much overall. He agrees with Finley that UK crows are loud and lively, but says he usually blocks most of it out. Esports players compete with over-ear headphones to make sure they get immersive surround sound from the game, and can hear their team-mates. ""I just try and lock in and zone out the crowd"", says Joe. Joe, who tells Newsbeat he lives ""in the middle of nowhere"" in north-west England - says travelling to some of the major venues where events happen takes away some of the ""home advantage"" feeling.

Jack, 21, from Derby, has only had to make a short journey for the weekend's tournament. But some of the biggest Rocket League contests are held in the US or South America - meaning a long-haul flight for visiting players. ""You're going to be more energised straight away,"" when you're closer to home, says Jack. ""Maybe the other teams are dealing with a bit of jet lag,"" he says. Esports including Rocket League depend on lightning-fast reflexes and quick thinking, not something you want to do if you're tired. ""If you're sleeping badly it can really mess with you,"" says Jack. ""You might not see the screen properly, your eyes might not be reacting properly. ""The smallest reaction time differences can make a big difference to winning or losing."" Jack says long-distance travel and jet lag - where your body clock needs time to adjust to a new time zone - has caused problems when he's tried to get rest for foreign competitions. ""It definitely feels different when you're playing in the UK,"" he says.

Archie 'Archie' Pickthall - Team Geekay

RLCS Archie from Leeds has been competing since 2018

Another advantage to playing closer to home is support from friends and family. It's not always possible for competitors to travel further afield with their relatives. Archie says he's looking forward to having his brother and dad cheer him on too. ""Most of the time when I'm playing it's just me. My family can't travel because of work,"" he says. They might get more chances to watch Archie in person. More global competitive gaming competitions are being held in the UK, with players from all around the world flying in to take part. National and local governments are keen to attract big tournaments because of the influx of visitors and cash they bring to local areas. But generally Archie says he doesn't let the crowd change how he plays, and only notices the cheers when his side scores a goal.

Assassin's Creed-maker Ubisoft gets $1.25bn investment from Chinese tech giant Tencent,"Assassin's Creed maker gets $1.25bn Chinese investment

Tencent, which is one of the world's biggest video games developers, is also known for its internet-based services, including the hugely popular messaging app WeChat.

The unit will run some of the French firm's biggest franchises, including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six.

Shenzhen-based Tencent will own about a quarter of the new business, with Ubisoft holding the rest of the new subsidiary, which is valued at around €4bn.

Chinese technology giant Tencent has made a €1.2bn ($1.25bn; £1bn) investment in a spin-off from Ubisoft, the maker of the Assassin's Creed video games.

""Today Ubisoft is opening a new chapter in its history,"" Yves Guillemot, Ubisoft's co-founder and chief executive said in a statement.

Tencent, which is China's most valuable company, is now Ubisoft's second biggest shareholder with a stake of just under 10%.

""We are excited to extend our longstanding partnership with Ubisoft through this investment,"" Martin Lau, President of Tencent, said.

Ubisoft said it will now focus on its other marquee titles, including Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon and The Division.

Ubisoft's stock market value has fallen sharply in recent years after delays to the launches of new games and falling sales.

That's despite its shares getting a boost earlier this month as investors welcomed the launch of the latest instalment of the Assassin's Creed franchise.

The much-anticipated Assassin's Creed Shadows had been delayed several times.

It followed the disappointing performance of another of the firm's major titles, Star Wars Outlaws, and concerns from some onlookers about how Ubisoft is being run.

""Ubisoft has all these great games, like Assassin's Creed, that it's known for that recently haven't delivered so much for fans,"" video games journalist Shannon Liao told the BBC.

""There are reasons for why that business is now up for grabs and for Tencent it's an opportunity for them to cash in on these franchises that are so beloved, that have so much street cred for gamers out there.""

The Assassin's Creed series has sold more than 200 million copies worldwide and, according to a Ubisoft earnings report published last year, generated about €4bn revenue in the decade up to 2024.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4l4y0yd03o,1
TikTok: Trump says he may cut China tariffs to help seal deal to sell the app,"China tariffs may be cut to seal TikTok sale, Trump says

Trump previously called for TikTok to be banned but now has an account on the platform

The legislation, which was signed into law in 2024, cited national security grounds for the sell or be banned order.

In January, he delayed the implementation of a law passed under the Biden administration to ban TikTok.

Trump also said he was willing to extend a 5 April deadline for a non-Chinese buyer of the platform to be found.

US President Donald Trump says he may cut tariffs on China to help seal a deal for short video app TikTok to be sold by its owner ByteDance.

""With respect to TikTok, and China is going to have to play a role in that, possibly in the form of an approval, maybe, and I think they'll do that,"" Trump told reporters on Wednesday.

""Maybe I'll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done,"" he added.

Trump also said he expected at least the outline of a deal to be reached by the 5 April deadline.

In response to the comments, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry said Beijing ""has repeatedly stated its position. China's opposition to the imposition of additional tariffs has always been consistent and clear"".

Trump made the comments after announcing new import taxes of 25% on all cars and car parts coming into the US in a move that threatens to widen the global trade war.

The BBC has contacted TikTok for comment.

The biggest sticking point to finalising a deal to sell the TikTok business, which is worth tens of billions of dollars, has always been securing Beijing's agreement.

Trump has previously tried to use tariffs as leverage in the negotiations.

On his first day back in the White House, on 20 January, the president threatened more import duties on China if it did not approve a TikTok deal.

The hugely popular app is used by around 170 million Americans.

Trump, who called for TikTok to be banned in his first term as president, now has an account on the platform.

He has more than 15 million followers and has said he received billions of views on the app during his presidential election campaign.

Separately, the US increased levies on all imports from China to 20% this month.

That doubled the tariffs Trump imposed on the world's second largest economy on 4 February.

On 10 February, China responded with its own tariffs, including a 10-15% tax on some US agricultural goods.

Beijing has also targeted various US aviation, defence and tech firms by adding them to an ""unreliable entity list"" and imposing export controls.

The 10% levy doubled to 20% on 4 March.

Watch: A real-life flying car takes to the skies,"An aeronautical company in the US has released footage showing a concept version of its flying car performing a vertical take-off before flying over an SUV.

Jim Dukhovny, the CEO of Alef Aeronautics, told the BBC's senior technology reporter Chris Vallance, that he had thousands of pre-orders and hoped to start production within 12 months.

For around $300,000 (£237,000) the company says buyers will get an electric flying car with a predicted airborne range of 110km (68 miles). But taking a friend for a spin may prove tricky - the cockpit only has enough room for one and a half people.

As Vallance points out, Alef Aeronautics are not the only ones trying to make flying cars take off with buyers. There are also huge technological and regulatory hurdles to overcome, so there's still a long way to go before science fiction becomes reality.

Maria 01 Maria 01 plans to become the biggest start-up campus in Europe

Yellow diggers are shoring up mounds of earth, as construction workers prepare to lay the foundations for what's set to become the largest start-up campus in Europe. The project is an expansion of Maria 01, a co-working and event space for entrepreneurs and investors, as well as larger corporations that want to collaborate with tech start-ups. Its existing facilities across the street already house around 240 start-ups. They are spread across six buildings that used to make up the city's first hospital, founded in the 19th Century and notorious in Helsinki for treating patients with the plague. Now, the current 20,000 sq m site is a hub for companies developing innovative health technologies, alongside AI, cybersecurity, gaming and defence tech start-ups. ""The whole place is really based on community,"" says Maria 01's CEO Sarita Runeberg. ""We bring people together so they can network… and find different kinds of resources to grow their businesses."" There are also office perks including a pool table, table football, running and ice bathing clubs, and in true Finnish-style, a sauna. ""We wouldn't be a proper start-up hub if we didn't have our own sauna here!"" laughs Ms Runeberg.

Maddy Savage Sarita Runeberg is overseeing the big expansion of Maria 01

While co-working spaces for tech companies are well established across the Nordics, Maria 01 is the largest of its kind in the region. It is run as a not-for-profit organisation partly funded by the city of Helsinki, which has invested more than €6m ($6.7m; £5.2m) in the hub since its launch in 2016. Ms Runeberg believes it will become the biggest start-up campus in Europe following the completion of three new buildings by 2028, adding a 50,000 sqm floor area. Later this year it is launching an accelerator programme designed to support and guide high-growth start-ups.

The hub's current and former members have already collectively raised over €1bn in funding. This represents around 40% of all early stage funding raised annually by Finnish start-ups. Ruben Byron is the Belgian co-founder of a start-up offering cloud services to AI developers. He has already scaled his business from a handful of staff using the hub's hot desks to a team of around 40 working from private offices in the former hospital, as well as remotely. ""That has been a great experience, that we've kind of been able [to] be nurtured here in a way,"" he says.

Maddy Savage Ruben Byron has grown his company to 40 staff at the Helsinki start-up hub

Although not as mature – or well known globally – as other European start-up hubs like Sweden and the UK, Finland has been steadily making a name for itself in the tech scene over the last two decades. The small Nordic nation, which has a population of around 5.6 million, has spawned 12 unicorn businesses – firms worth a billion dollars or more – including sleep and fitness tracking ring Oura, game developers Supercell, Rovio (the creators of the Angry Birds game), and food delivery platform Wolt. Last year, Startup Blink, a global index mapping more than 100 countries ranked Finland's start-up ecosystem the 7th best in western Europe, and 14th in the world. The index cites factors including hubs like Maria 01, alongside high levels of state and university support, and Slush - a huge annual non-profit gathering for global start-ups and investors. It also highlights Finland's transparent and open business culture. ""There is an authenticity with the Finns,"" says Jack Parker, a Helsinki-based founder originally from Newcastle upon Tyne, who runs a healthcare innovation start-up. ""Ego doesn't really play a part. So if I reach out to somebody, it's quite likely eight out of 10 times that they will respond.""

Maddy Savage British entrepreneur Jack Parker says Finns have been very welcoming

Finland's right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2023, is on a mission to push the country even further up global indices, stating in its official government programme that it wants the Nordic nation to become a leader in fostering a dynamic start-up and growth company ecosystem. ""It's not just about rankings,"" says Marjo Ilmari, who runs the start-up services team at Business Finland, the government agency that promotes investment and innovation. In 2024 Business Finland alone invested €112m in start-ups, an increase of 30% compared to the previous year. ""The real goal is to create an environment where our ground-breaking start-ups can emerge and really tackle global challenges."" The agency hopes this will help drive growth in the Finnish economy, which went into recession in 2023 and is currently making a sluggish recovery, with the Bank of Finland forecasting an increase of less than 1% this year.

The country is also trying to attract more global talent by offering start-up permits for international founders who want to grow their businesses in Finland. These entrepreneurs are eligible for a so-called soft-landing support package provided by Business Finland. ""They give you advice, support, sometimes grants to support the initiation phase,"" explains Lalin Keyvan, a Turkish-born entrepreneur at Maria 01 who says the scheme was one of the main reasons why she relocated to Helsinki. Business Finland's marketing campaigns for would-be movers highlight social and lifestyle factors too: Finns tend to prioritise wellbeing, plus there's free education and subsidised healthcare and childcare. ""You don't really have to choose between building a high-growth company and enjoying life, because you can do both,"" says Ms Ilmari.

Getty Images Business Finland highlights lifestyle reasons for choosing Helsinki

But whether all this is enough for Finland to compete with Europe's more established start-up hubs is up for debate. Data suggests it still has a long way to go to catch up with neighbouring Sweden, long the Nordic darling of the European start-up scene. It is home to more than 40 unicorn businesses including Spotify, payments platform Klarna and game developer King. In Startup Blink's ecosystem ranking Sweden ranks second in Europe after the UK, and top in the EU. In the last decade it has attracted more than $29bn in funding compared to just over $8bn in Finland, according to the annual State of European Tech report by investment company Atomico. ""I love Finland's bold approach,"" says Charlotte Ekelund, deputy CEO of Sting, a non-profit organisation that helps develop start-ups in Stockholm. However she believes Finland is still years behind Sweden in terms of pulling in capital and developing its ecosystem. ""We observe some of the things that the Finnish ecosystem is doing now, Sting was part of driving 10 or 15 years ago here - co-working spaces, [and] new organisations in the ecosystem that can support in different ways.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx28y8jj4lxo,1

Getty Images India's trainer market is attractive for overseas firms

It's likely that you have not heard of Taiwan's Hong Fu Industrial Group, but look down on a busy street and you may well see its products. Hong Fu is the world's second-biggest maker of trainers (sneakers) supplying shoes to Nike, Converse, Adidas, Puma and many others. It makes around 200 million pairs of sports shoes a year. So when it made a big investment in India's market, the footwear industry took note. Hong Fu is currently building a giant plant in Panapakkam, in the state of Tamil Nadu in south eastern India. When fully operational, some time in the next three to five years, it will make 25 million pairs of shoes a year, employing as many as 25,000 workers. The project has Indian partners, including Aqeel Panaruna, the chairman of Florence Shoe Company: ""The international market is saturated and they [Hong Fu] were looking for a new market,"" he explains. ""There is a drastic increase in non-leather footwear in India. It has huge potential,"" Mr Panaruna added.

The Indian government is keen to attract such investment, hoping it will raise standards in the footwear industry and boost exports. To spur the industry, last August the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) introduced new quality rules for all shoes sold in India. Under those standards, for example, materials will have to pass tests of strength and flexibility. ""These BIS standards are really about cleaning up the market. We've had too many low-quality products flooding in, and consumers deserve better,"" says Sandeep Sharma a journalist and footwear industry expert.

India has a vast network of small-scale shoemakers

But many in India can't afford shoes from well-known brands. Serving them is a huge and intricate network of small shoe makers, known as the unorganised sector. Their affordable products are estimated to account for two-thirds of the total footwear market. Ashok (he withheld his full name) counts himself as part of that sector, with shoe making units all across the district of Agra in northern India. He estimates that 200,0000 pairs of shoes are made everyday by operations like his across Agra. ""Many consumers, especially in rural and lower-income urban areas, opt for cheaper local footwear instead of branded options,"" he says. ""Many organised brands struggle to expand their retail footprint in semi-urban and rural areas because we cater to them."" So how will the new government standards affect makers like Ashok? ""It's complicated,"" says Mr Sharma. ""I think the government is trying to walk a tightrope here. They can't just shut down thousands of small businesses that employ millions of people - that would be economic suicide. ""What I'm seeing is more of a carrot-and-stick approach. They're pushing for standards, but also rolling out programs to help small manufacturers upgrade their processes. It's not about wiping out the unorganised sector but gradually bringing them into the fold."" Making the situation more complicated is that the unorganised sector is well-known for making counterfeit shoes of big brands. While popular among Indian shoppers looking for a stylish bargain, other countries have long-complained about the losses caused.

Zen Barefoot Zen Barefoot is trying to popularise barefoot shoes in India

Meanwhile, a host of new Indian trainer-makers are springing up, to serve India's growing middle class. Sabhib Agrawal is trying to get those buyers interested in barefoot footwear - shoes which, their makers say, are healthy for the foot as they encourage natural, or barefoot, movement. Mr Agrawal says his company, Zen Barefoot, is unusual as much of the Indian footwear industry is not very innovative. ""There are very few people who are ready to take time and invest in new technologies here. Indian manufacturing is a very profit- first market, ROI [return on investment] driven. ""And in a lot of cases, even the government is not ready to enable these industries through grants or tax relief, which makes it quite difficult."" Comet is one Indian firm looking to innovate. It claims to be the first homegrown trainer brand that owns the whole production process, from design to manufacturing. ""This level of control allows us to experiment with materials, introduce innovative silhouettes, and continuously refine comfort and fit based on real feedback,"" says founder Utkarsh Gupta. He says the Comet shoes are adapted to India's climate and roads. ""Most homegrown brands rely on off-the-shelf soles from the market, but when we started Comet, we realized that these were lacking in quality, durability, and grip,"" he says. Change is coming to the footwear sector he says. ""The shift to high value is now happening."" ""Many high value brands need to move their manufacturing to India. In 3-5 years, we should have a robust ecosystem to compete in the international sneaker market,"" he adds.

Jay Springett Jay Springett experimented with new social platforms

Jay Springett, a tech strategist and podcast host, joined the social media app Butterflies AI out of curiosity, and ended up staying for more than six months. The idea of Butterflies is to allow human and AI personas to interact. Mr Springett's online persona developed over time, interacting with other artificial characters, and even went as far as to start its own Beanie Babies [a line of soft toys] collection. He said it was like AIs were writing their own soap operas inside a simulation. ""I didn't engage with Butterflies in the same way I do with other platforms,"" Mr Springett told BBC. ""It felt more like observing than participating. I wouldn't pay for it, but it was interesting enough to keep watching.""

Butterflies AI Human and AI personas interact at Butterflies AI

A host of social media services, like Butterflies, are trying to expand at a time when there is dissatisfaction with the social media giants. According to data from Similarweb, a digital market intelligence company, X's daily active users in the UK have dropped by nearly 25% since January 2024. And it's not just X that has been suffering, mobile and desktop traffic to Facebook has declined over the last few years according to Similarweb. A report by the Pew Research Centre found that a third of teens use Facebook and X, compared with three quarters a decade ago.

Bluesky is one of the social media firms gaining ground. Over the past year, Bluesky has gained tens of millions of new users, often at the expense of X. Apart from just timing, though, BlueSky's success can be largely attributed to its novel architecture, which pairs an X-like experience with a high degree of customization. Unlike centralized systems, where social media companies have complete control over content and identities, Bluesky users can choose how their feeds are moderated, and what kind of posts the algorithm recommends to them, thanks to the hundreds of options offered by both Bluesky and the community. Don't like the broader discourse on Bluesky? Jump on the ""popular with friends"" feed to see what the people you follow specifically are talking about. It will not be simple for Bluesky to scale up to the size of X and Facebook, says Andy Tattersall, an information specialist at the University of Sheffield. He ways it will have to strike a balance between ""generating revenue, keeping users safe, and moderating content, which is much easier said than done"".

Getty Images X has been losing users to newcomers like Bluesky

Celebrity-backed foundation, Free Our Feeds, hopes to do that. It's backed some notable names, including musician Brian Eno and actor Mark Ruffalo, and plans to raise $30m (£23m) over the next three years to support an open social media ecosystem powered by the AT Protocol, the decentralized network powering Bluesky. ""Bluesky has created a strong foundation for shared social media infrastructure,"" says Robin Berjon, one of Free Our Feeds' nine custodians, ""but so long as they are the primary operator of this infrastructure the risk remains that it will stop operating in the public interest"".

A bigger worry for these emerging platforms, though, is the network barrier. This can be summed up with Metcalfe's Law, explains Evan Prodromou, co-author and current editor of ActivityPub, another open social media architecture, which is behind popular platforms like Meta's Threads. The law states that the value of a network goes up with the square of the number of users. That means that bigger social networks have way more resources than smaller ones. They can use those resources to get bigger and bigger and crowd out smaller social media services. Non-profits like Free Our Feeds and the Social Web Foundation, which Mr Prodromou heads, have a strategy that they hope will help them overcome that Metcalfe's Law. They hope to replace the current situation, where users of social media hop between their favourite services. Instead Social Web Foundation is developing a platform which can offer content from all of them. Threads for example supports a protocol called ActivityPub, which makes it easier to combine services with other social media firms that use that protocol - like Mastodon for instance. Using this kind of interoperability, Mr Prodromou hopes that services like Social Web Foundation will provide the same value as giant, monolithic platforms.

Watch: Man trapped in driverless car as it spins in circles

Mike Johns didn't expect his return trip from Los Angeles to Scottsdale, Arizona in December to go viral. To get to the airport he booked a driverless taxi and enjoyed a thrill when he jumped in with curious bystanders looking on. But he got much more attention than he bargained for. Mr Johns found himself being driven around and around a car park while those same bystanders looked on. The Waymo ride was not doing what it should and there was no obvious way Mr Johns could fix it - and he had a flight to catch. Mr Johns recorded the experience, a video that went viral almost immediately and was picked up on TV stations around the world, casting fresh public doubt about self-driving cars and how ready they are for real-world passengers. ""Why is this happening to me on a Monday morning?"" Mr Johns filmed himself asking. Eventually a voice activated inside the car telling him to access the Waymo app to get the vehicle back under control.

Waymo which is owned by Alphabet, the parent company of Google, told the BBC that it released a software update almost immediately fixing the problem. The company says its driverless system is ""better than humans at avoiding crashes that result in injuries, airbag deployments, and police reports"". Nevertheless, Mr John's experience is not the first time the company has had to take action. Last year the company recalled more than 600 cars after one hit a street pole. And in May 2024 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched a probe into 22 incidents involving Waymo vehicles .

The road to a driverless future has also gone awry for rival services. In December, US car giant General Motors closed down its self-driving car subsidiary Cruise. GM attributed the change of strategy to ""the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business"". In October 2023, one of its vehicles hit a pedestrian and dragged her for more than 20ft (6m), leaving her seriously injured. Meanwhile, in February of last year, it emerged that Apple's rumoured self-driving car project was folding. Uber abandoned its own driverless car efforts in 2020. But some big players remain in the race, including Zoox, which is owned by Amazon, as well as chipmaker Nvidia and Elon Musk's Tesla. Waymo is the leading US player though. It already operates self-driving taxis in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas and is promising to launch soon in Atlanta and Miami, Florida. So why has Waymo succeeded where other efforts, at least in the US, have failed? ""Three things - people, money and process,"" says Sven Beiker, a lecturer at Stanford Graduate School of Business, and managing director of Silicon Valley Mobility, an automotive consultancy. He points out that over the years Waymo has employed some of the leading figures in autonomous vehicle engineering, it has the financial weight of Google-owner Alphabet behind it, and has become thorough in its approach. ""They've come around to really playing by the book, to be a good steward of processes... working with regulators to make sure what they deploy is safe.""

So what's next? Regions with good weather are likely to see driverless services first says Philipp Kampshoff, global co-leader of Automotive and Assembly Practice at the consultancy giant McKinsey. That would include southern US states like Texas and Florida, where Waymo already has plans. ""Robo-taxis still operate much better in good weather conditions. They still, for the most part, struggle in heavy snow,"" Mr Kampshoff says. He also points out that the batteries perform better in warmer conditions, which is particularly important for driverless cars that need a lot of energy to power on board computing. ""Bringing this all together, in the second part of the 2020s, you will see one city after the other being unlocked and then scaling within these cities,"" he says.

It will be a slow process. ""It's actually quite a labour intensive process to roll out this technology, which includes a fair amount of human driving,"" says Mr Beiker. ""You need to drive those vehicles through the streets where you want to deploy them, and you need to drive them over and over again, and you need to, to some extent, manually edit the data,"" he adds. And the whole process could also be held up by safety concerns. ""This is only going to happen if we're not running into major accidents. The moment major accidents are going to happen, a lot of these operations are going to be shut down,"" says Mr Kampshoff.

Scania Scania is among several truck makers testing autonomous systems

For those working on self-driving trucks, safety is arguably on even bigger worry. ""Safety is the number one concern that we work on,"" says David Liu, the chief executive of Plus, which makes driverless software for trucks and works with global companies such as Amazon, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Scania. ""Autonomous trucks and autonomous vehicles, need to be much safer than average human driven vehicle,"" says Mr Liu. ""Human drivers are great, but not flawless. Most of the accidents we get ourselves into are due to driver inattentiveness. And we don't have that issue with technology,"" Mr Liu explains. ""A robo-taxi mostly runs within cities in low-speed environments, while trucks are typically run on highways at higher speed. ""So we do need to put in different set of technology to be able to see more clearly around the trucks and be able to handle a longer braking distance, for instance.""

To see into the driverless future it might be worth watching developments in China. In the city of Wuhan more than 500 driverless cars are being operated by the company Baidu. Across the country driverless cars are reported to be operating in 16 cities and being tested by 19 manufacturers. ""There's definitely more competition... there are four or five companies that are very similar to Waymo,"" says Mr Beiker who is currently working on a study of robo-taxi deployments around the world, sponsored by Sweden's innovation agency Vinnova.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly41yx9w88o,1

Getty Images Storm Babet caused flooding across the UK in October 2023

When Storm Babet hit the town of Trowell in Nottingham in 2023, Claire Sneddon felt confident her home would not be affected. After all, when she bought the property in 2021, she was told by the estate agent that a previous flood the year before, which had reached but not effected the property, was a once-in-a-lifetime event, and that flooding measures to protect the properties on the cul-de-sac would be put in place. However, when Storm Babet tore through the UK two years later, Ms Sneddon's home flooded after several days of rain. ""We knew there would be water on the cul-de-sac but no one expected it to flood internally again. However, water entered the property for five hours,"" she says. ""It reached to the top of the skirting boards. We had to have all the flooring, woodwork and lower kitchen replaced, which took nearly 12 months."" Their final insurance bill was around £45,000. She says they were fortunate to have qualified for a government scheme providing affordable insurance for homeowners in areas of high-flood risk. Although she loves the area, her neighbours and the house, the weather is now a cause of stress. ""We constantly worry about the weather, if it is going to rain longer than a couple of days, or there is a named storm. ""We do wish we had taken more steps to understand the risk. The survey showed that the property was in a medium flood zone, but there wasn't much detail other than flood zone maps.""

Claire Sneddon Claire Sneddon's house was flooded for hours and took weeks to dry out

Climate change is increasing the likelihood and intensity of natural disasters such as floods, wildfires and hurricanes. While it might be too late for Ms Sneddon and other homeowners, new tools are being developed to help people and companies assess climate risk. Last December, the UK Environment Agency updated its National Flood Risk Assessment (NaFRA), showing current and future flood risk from rivers, the sea and surface water for England. It used its own data alongside that of local authorities and climate data from the Met Office. It also brought up to date the National Coastal Erosion Risk Map (NCERM). They were both last updated in 2018 and 2017 respectively. The new NaFRA data shows as many as 6.3 million properties in England are in areas at risk of flooding from rivers, the sea or surface water, and with climate change this could increase to around eight million by 2050. ""We have spent the last few years transforming our understanding of flood and coastal erosion risk in England, drawing on the best available data... as well as improved modelling and technological advances,"" says Julie Foley, director of flood risk strategy at the Environment Agency. ""When we account for the latest climate projections, one in four properties could be in areas at risk of flooding by the middle of the century."" The Environment Agency plans to launch a portal where users can check their long-term flood risk. Similar resources exist for Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales through the ABI.

""We can no longer rely on historical data,"" says Lukky Ahmed, co-founder of Climate X. The London-based climate risk firm offers a digital twin of the Earth, which simulates different extreme weather events and their potential impact on properties, infrastructure and assets under different emissions scenarios. It combines artificial intelligence with physics-based climate models. ""While many climate models might tell you how much rainfall to expect, they don't say what happens when that water hits the ground,"" he says. ""Our models simulate, for example, what happens when the water hits, where it travels and what the impact of the flooding will be."" While banks and other lenders are testing their product, property companies are currently using their services when considering new developments. ""They log into our platform and identify locations and existing building stock and in return they receive risk rating and severity metrics tied to hazards,"" says Mr Ahmed.

Many parts of the world have much more extreme weather than the UK. In the US in January, devastating wild fires tore through parts of Los Angeles. Meanwhile Hurricane Milton, which landed last October, is likely to be one of the costliest hurricanes to hit west Florida. To help insurers manage those costs, New York-based Faura analyses the resilience of homes and commercial buildings. ""We look at the different elements of a property to understand how likely it is to survive and pinpoint resilience and survivability of a property,"" says Faura co-founder Valkyrie Holmes. ""We tell companies and homeowners whether their property will still be standing after a disaster, not just whether a disaster will happen in an area,"" he adds. Faura bases its assessments on satellite and aerial imagery and data from surveys and disaster reports. ""Insurance companies technically have the data to be able to do this but have not build out the models to quantify it,"" says Mr Holmes.

Mater The Mater hospital in Dublin - home to Ireland's busiest emergency department

For a country famous as Big Tech's European address, Ireland's hospitals often lag far behind in technology. They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics. In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E. Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online. But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare. That includes a programme called Sláintecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its €22.9bn (£20bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's.

To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved. It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department. That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen. ""In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,"" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater. Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment. To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: ""We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures."" The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to. ""Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,"" he says.

Mater Hospital Prof Peter McMahon introduced AI to scanning at Dublin's Mater hospital

Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges. Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends. Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin. But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a ""synthetic MRI"" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries. That was done by feeding a ""generative AI"" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person. Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments. And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.

Peter MacMahon Ireland keeps digital scans in a central digital library

Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008. But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally. That will ""severely delay"" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon. Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge. ""Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,"" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin. ""Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,"" he says.

Using AI in healthcare is not without problems. An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing. But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication. To prevent such AI from hallucinating, ""you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,"" says Prof MacMahon. AIs can have biases, but ""humans have biases too"", he points out. A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot. ""For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error"", than in new health technology where ""the acceptable risk is zero"", says Prof Seán Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin. This means we ""continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans"", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.

Duarte Dias Lisbon, Dublin and Seattle - like many Duarte Dias has moved to move up

In 2020, Duarte Dias, a Portuguese software engineer, accepted a job offer to work in Microsoft's Dublin subsidiary. A little over a year later, he joined a team at Microsoft's headquarters in Seattle, where he still works. Even though he misses the Portuguese laid-back approach to life, and the family-like team spirit of the work environments there, he does not regret, not for one second, his choice of pursuing an international career. Mr Dias's decision was made easier by all the financial impact of moving. The verdict of the spreadsheet was clear: staying in Portugal would be financially ruinous. ""I did simulations of how much money I would save a year in Portugal, and I quickly realised that I wouldn't be able to have a comfortable life financially, even if I got one of the most well-paying jobs available in engineering for my experience level,"" says.

A two-year job experience in Portugal while Mr Dias was concluding his masters at Lisbon's Instituto Superior Técnico cemented his conviction: his yearly income amounted to €35,000 ($36,000; £29,000). But his take home salary was much, much less. His income placed him in a tax bracket which meant up to 40% of this gross salary went to the state. ""Financially it was bad. It would be very hard to save money if I didn't live with my parents,"" he recalls. Moving to Ireland meant an immediate hike in his salary prospects, almost doubling to €60,000. The money is even better in the US, where he now earns upwards of $160,000 before a 20% income tax rate, much lower than at home. Mr Dias intends to return to Lisbon in two years' time with ""with many more savings"".

Getty Images Portugal is an attractive place to live but still many youngsters go abroad

Keeping skilled workers like Mr Dias in Portugal has been a concern for recent governments. In 2020, the administration led by the Socialist Party's Antonio Costa launched IRS Jovem, a programme of tax reductions for workers less than 30 years old and tiered by level of education. In 2022, 73,684 taxpayers benefitted from this incentive, according to official data. After a snap election in March, the new centre-right Portuguese government led by Luis Montenegro doubled down on the idea and expanded it from five to 10 years, and to all workers under 35 independently of their educational levels. The proposal, passed by the Portuguese parliament in late November, is due to benefit up to 400,000 workers, according to the Portuguese Ministry of Finance.

But specialists say it likely won't be enough to keep the young from going abroad. ""It is unlikely that, on its own, the tax regime will make young workers remain in the country, whether because professional opportunities are more abundant in foreign countries, or due to the fact this tax benefit applies only to yearly incomes under €28,000,"" says Sérgio Vasques, professor of tax law at the Católica Lisbon School of Law. He points out that the Portuguese government still takes more of the average worker's salary than most richer nations. Known as the tax wedge, the ratio between the amount of taxes paid by an average single worker without children and the corresponding total labour cost for the employer, stands at 42.3% in Portugal. That's the 8th highest among the 38 member countries of the OECD. ""This is a tax regime that is an enemy of qualified work and professional success. This regime will not solve this problem,"" adds Mr Vasques. Mr Vasques, also a former secretary of state for tax affairs in the early 2010s, adds: ""I also cannot imagine a young professional deciding to move to Portugal just because of an extra couple hundred euros at the end of the year. ""Not even a low-skilled worker will make a decision based on that. Portuguese food works probably better as an incentive to move here than that tax regime"".

Getty Images Poland also has measures in place to keep young people from heading abroad

Rita de La Feria, chair of tax law at the University of Leeds, reminds that the exodus of young people isn't just a Portuguese problem, and that Europe is grappling with the challenges of young emigration. According to a study requested by the Portuguese Parliament, as of July, in the European Union Portugal, Poland and Croatia had special tax regimes based on the taxpayers' ages. ""The challenges are very obvious: worker mobility is higher. The problem is that the country spends very large amounts on training for them to leave for other countries as soon as they enter the workforce,"" she said. Ms de La Feria, who moved to the UK at a young age, told the BBC that when she left Portugal she did not intend to ""leave for good: many leave their countries of origin thinking they will come back at some point. But once they form a family, it's almost impossible to return.""

Google Many organisations are developing quantum computers

Twenty five years ago computer programmers were racing to fix the millennium bug amidst fears that it would cause banking systems to crash and planes to fall out of the sky. Much to everyone's relief the impact turned out to be minimal. Today, some fear there is a new critical threat to the world’s digital infrastructure. But this time, we cannot predict exactly when it will move from theory to reality, while the ubiquity of digital technology means fixing the problem is even more complicated. That’s because the arrival of quantum computing means that many of the encryption algorithms that underpin and secure our hyperconnected world will be trivially easy to crack. Quantum computing is radically different to the “classical” computing used today. Instead of processing binary bits which exist in one of two states – one or zero, on or off – quantum computing uses qubits, which can exist in multiple states, or superpositions. “The reason why it's so powerful is because you're doing all those possible computations simultaneously,” Prof Nishanth Sastry, director of research for computer science at the University of Surrey, explains. This means it's “much, much more efficient, much, much more powerful.” This means quantum systems offer the possibility of solving key problems that are beyond classical computers, is areas such as medical research and materials science, or cracking particularly complex mathematical problems.

The problem is some of those same mathematical problems underpin the encryption algorithms that help to ensure trust, confidentiality and privacy across today’s computer networks. Today’s computers would take thousands, even millions of years, to crack current encryption standards, such as RSA. A suitably powerful quantum computer could, theoretically, do the job in minutes. This has implications for everything from electronic payments and ecommerce to satellite communications. “Anything that's protected by something that's vulnerable becomes fair game for people that have access to quantum relevant computers,” says Jon France, chief information security officer at non-profit cybersecurity organization ISC2. Quantum computers capable of breaking asymmetric encryption are thought to be years away. But progress is being made. In December, Google said its new quantum chip incorporates key ""breakthroughs"" and ""paves the way to a useful, large-scale quantum computer"". Some estimates say a quantum device capable of breaking current encryption would require 10,000 qubits, while others say millions would be needed. Today’s systems have a few hundred at most. But businesses and governments face a problem right now, as attackers could harvest encrypted information and decrypt it later when they do gain access to suitably powerful devices.

Google Google's says its new computer chip brings useful quantum computers closer

Greg Wetmore, vice president for software development at security firm Entrust, says if such devices could emerge in the next decade, technology leaders need to ask, “What data in your organization is valuable for that period of time?” That could be national security information, personal data, strategic plans, and intellectual property and secrets - think of a soft drink company’s “secret” formula or the precise balance of herbs and spices in a fast food recipe. Mr France adds, if quantum computing becomes widespread, the threat becomes more immediate with the encryption that protects our daily banking transactions, for example, potentially trivial to break. The good news is that researchers and the technology industry have been working on solutions to the problem. In August, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the US released three post quantum encryption standards. The agency said these would “secure a wide range of electronic information, from confidential email messages to e-commerce transactions that propel the modern economy.” It is encouraging computer system administrators to transition to the new standards as soon as possible, and said a further 18 algorithms are being evaluated as backup standards.

Getty Images Critical infrastructure like water treatment plants will need security upgrades

The problem is this means a massive upgrade process touching virtually all our technology infrastructure. “If you think about the number of things out there with asymmetric encryption in them, it's billions of things. We're facing a really big change problem,” says Mr France. Some digital infrastructure will be relatively easy to upgrade. Your browser, for example, will simply receive an update from the vendor says Mr France. “The challenge really comes in discrete devices and the internet of things (IOT),” he continues. These might be hard to track down, and geographically inaccessible. Some equipment – legacy devices in critical national infrastructure such as water systems, for example – might not be powerful enough to handle the new encryption standards. Mr Wetmore says the industry has managed encryption transitions in the past, but “It's the sharper discontinuity that makes this threat more serious.” So, it is trying to help customers build “crypto agility” by setting out policies now and using automation to identify and manage their cryptographic assets. “That's the secret to making this transition an orderly one and not a chaotic one.”

And the challenge extends into space. Prof Sastry says many satellites – such as the Starlink network – should be relatively straightforward to upgrade, even if it means briefly taking an individual device offline temporarily. “At any given point in time, especially with the LEO (low earth orbit) satellites, you've got 10 to 20 satellites above your head,” Prof Sastry says. “So, if one can't serve you, well so what? There are nine others that can serve you.” More challenging, he says, are “remote sensing” satellites, which include those used for geographical or intelligence purposes. These carry a lot more compute power on board and typically include some sort of secure computing module. A hardware upgrade effectively means replacing the whole device. However, says Prof Sastry, this is now less of a problem thanks to more frequent and lower cost satellite launches.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpq9zxxn72qo,1

Reemy Zeeshan Ali has dozens of wigs for his drag act

Zeeshan Ali has been a drag artist for 10 years and has taken his show all over India. Central to his performance is a collection of around 45 wigs. “It’s an alter of identity, helping me transition from my everyday self into exaggerated, glamorous or whimsical characters. The right wig makes me feel more authentic and empowers me to command the stage,"" says Ali, who is based in Mumbai. But getting that look right wasn't easy in the early days. ""When I started my career the accessibility of the wigs was extremely difficult in India. Most of them were to be sourced from abroad or I used to make wigs sourced from whatever was available to me like wool, fabric,"" he says. But things are different now. “The trend is changing. Wigs are no longer just meant for drag or movie artists, but many straight women wear wigs to look different. It's no longer just a hair accessory but a style statement.”

Indian hair has always been in demand for wig-making. The nation is the world's biggest exporter of human hair, supplying 85% of global demand. Kolachi Venkatesh, based in Avadi, Chennai, has been collecting hair for 20 years. He started at the bottom of the industry as a picker - collecting hair from households and rescuing it from the rubbish. “My parents were hair pickers and then I started doing the same,"" he says. Hair collected by pickers from homes, salons and barbershops is called non-Remy hair. It requires more processing than Remy hair, which is carefully shaved straight from the scalp. Nevertheless, it has value. ""It’s just thrown away but it's gold,"" says Mr Venkatesh. Those pickers typically sell hair to local traders like Mr Venkatesh for between 10 cents and $1 (£0.80) per kilogram, depending on the quality and length of the hair. Shorter or damaged hair fetches less, while longer strands bring higher prices. For the individual picker, there's not much money in it. “A diligent collector might gather 1–5 kilograms of hair in a day, earning anywhere from 59 cents to $6 per day. This income level is often below minimum wage standards, particularly in rural areas,” says Mr Venkatesh, who has 50 pickers working for him. “While our work contributes to a billion-dollar global market our earnings remain meagre. Intermediaries control prices.”

Kolachi Venkatesh Kolachi Venkatesh has been collecting hair for 20 years

Most of the Indian hair collected by traders like Mr Venkatesh is exported to China where it is made into wigs. “China has a huge wigmaking industry which is worth five to six billion dollars,"" says Benjamin Cherian from Plexconcil, the hair industry body that promotes the Indian industry and liaises with the government. If India wants a slice of the lucrative wig market, he says, then it has a lot of catching up to do. ""When we look at China there are hundreds of factories spread across the country which add value to the hair industry, whereas in India the value addition still needs to be picked up,” Mr Cherian says. He says the government needs to help promote investment in the hair industry. ""It needs automated sorting systems, sophisticated hair treatment procedures for the hair collected, innovative production techniques for manufacturing of wigs which will make India stand out.” Instead of exporting hair for hundreds of dollars, India should be selling wigs worth thousands of dollars says Mr Cherian. “We have started working on it but it’s a long way to go. We need to have research and training centres,"" he says.

Diva Divine Hair Diva Divine Hair has been making wigs and extensions since 2009

One Indian business trying to make inroads is Delhi-based Diva Divine Hair, co-founded by Krishan Jalani in 2019. It is currently managed by chief executive and co-founder Nidhi Tiwari. The idea was to create high-quality hair extensions and wigs that would appeal to a broader range of customers. ""There is a growing need for these solutions due to rising issues of hair loss and thinning among women in India,"" says Ms Tiwari. The company has been helped by a shift in attitude. ""Once considered a niche or taboo topic, wigs and extensions are now openly discussed, thanks to evolving social norms and a shift toward acceptance,"" she says. Wigs have also seen a lot of development making them more attractive and comfortable. ""Technologies such as 3D-printed wigs and digital colour-matching tools offer highly personalised options. Lightweight, breathable wig caps and improved adhesives have given customers to wear it for long time without discomfort,"" says Ms Tiwari.

George Cherion Demand for Indian hair is ""skyrocketing"" says George Cherion

At the top end of the hair market is Temple or Remy hair. Much of the supply comes from Hindu temples in the south of the country where hair is shaved off in an act of veneration and faith. Raj Hair International is one of the biggest traders in the Temple hair business. Craftsmen at the company's Chennai factory sort and grade the hair according to colour, texture and length. ""Remy hair has aligned cuticles, hair flows uniformly in one direction, which leads to less tangling and a silkier texture. This is high-value hair,"" says George Cherion, the company's chief executive. The firm tries to waste as little of the hair as possible. To help with that it developed a machine to untangle the hair. It's allowed them to work faster with fewer staff. ""Our mission is to constantly upgrade the technology,"" says Mr Cherion. Business is booming. ""Indian human is in demand globally due to its high quality, natural look, and thinness. The demand is skyrocketing,"" he says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dl93l7w2go,1

""It started with simple things like giving people hugs in public and giving out roses and flowers and things that would make people smile,"" says Weidenhofer, now 21, and living in Melbourne, Australia. The difference was Weidenhofer filmed these acts and shared them across his social media accounts. The content spiralled and four years later, on Instagram alone he has amassed 1.7 million followers, where he can be seen surprising a person with a serious illness with money or a visit from a celebrity such as Jake Paul or Kristen Bell. ""I hope my videos inspire someone just a little bit,"" he says.

Kindness content creators, or influencers as they're often called, are increasing in numbers on social media. Their approaches differ but a common tactic is to secretly film someone being given money, or tickets to a gig or sports match, or perhaps a free haircut. ""Kindness is cool,"" says Zachery Dereniowski, 31, in the bio of his Instagram account where he has 5.7 million followers. Mr Dereniowski's videos often involve him telling a stranger that he is hungry and asking for food. When the person helps him out, he rewards the person with a gift, such as a laptop, or money. ""I suppose I want to really emphasise that every single person you come across has a story… and often the people who have the least give the most,"" says Mr Dereniowski, who lives in Windsor, near Toronto in Canada, and started the account after giving free hugs to strangers.

Like many influencers, the kindness creators make money from adverts and sponsorship from the brands they work with. For example they might do a deal that involves giving away a particular brand's product.

The videos of kindness content creators attract millions of views. Why are they so popular? Saoirse Cleary, creative strategy director at marketing agency MG Empower, says they incorporate many of the elements that both social media algorithms and audiences favour: strong hooks, engaging captions, heartfelt narratives, and authentic, unscripted moments. ""Audiences are captivated by raw, real interactions with everyday people, offering an emotional connection from the comfort of their own screens. People increasingly seek positivity, authenticity, and emotional resonance in their online experiences, especially in spaces often saturated with entertainment-driven content.""

Saoirse Cleary The 'authenticity' of kindness content appeals to audiences says Saoirse Cleary

On the face of it the acts seem well meaning, so why do they attract criticism? """"While these influencers may be genuinely generous... the generosity can sometimes feel performative, as it often serves as a way to attract more views, engagement, and ultimately financial reward, rather than purely altruistic motives,"" says Ms Cleary. Others go further, questing whether focussing on one, usually vulnerable person, is the right way to help out. ""I find the typical set up of many of the scenes quite disturbing,"" says Hilda Burke, a psychotherapist, accredited with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy. She explains that the videos often involve someone being identified as ""in need"". They are then asked for a favour. It might be spare money for a bus fare or help with something. She argues the participant is being ""lured"" into valuing the needs of someone else, who appears richer, more highly than their own. Only if they do that are they rewarded. ""I wonder what happens to those who don't play the game?,"" asks Ms Burke.

The influencers defend themselves by arguing that using social media this way is an effective strategy. ""I can raise more money, so I can help more people if I post it online,"" says Mr Weidenhofer. And how about filming people without their consent? ""If you are doing a video where you're giving a hug to someone, if you tell them beforehand, it just takes away that authenticity,"" says Mr Weidenhofer. But he adds that these days he avoids filming people without consent as it was making him ""feel weird"".

Sometimes large amounts of money are given to vulnerable people, which they might not be in a position to manage. Mr Dereniowski realised that this might be an issue when he raised $240,000 overnight for a father and son who were living in their car. After that, more thought goes into longer term help. ""We've started setting up financial advisors. We've started getting these people jobs. We've helped allocate the funds properly to pay off their debt, their car, helping them get a home and [pay their] rent,"" he says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23v3kxknrno,1

""It's easier to get forgiveness than permission,"" says John, a software engineer at a financial services technology company. ""Just get on with it. And if you get in trouble later, then clear it up."" He's one of the many people who are using their own AI tools at work, without the permission of their IT division (which is why we are not using John's full name). According to a survey by Software AG, half of all knowledge workers use personal AI tools. The research defines knowledge workers as ""those who primarily work at a desk or computer"". For some it's because their IT team doesn't offer AI tools, while others said they wanted their own choice of tools. John's company provides GitHub Copilot for AI-supported software development, but he prefers Cursor. ""It's largely a glorified autocomplete, but it is very good,"" he says. ""It completes 15 lines at a time, and then you look over it and say, 'yes, that's what I would've typed'. It frees you up. You feel more fluent."" His unauthorised use isn't violating a policy, it's just easier than risking a lengthy approvals process, he says. ""I'm too lazy and well paid to chase up the expenses,"" he adds. John recommends that companies stay flexible in their choice of AI tools. ""I've been telling people at work not to renew team licences for a year at a time because in three months the whole landscape changes,"" he says. ""Everybody's going to want to do something different and will feel trapped by the sunk cost."" The recent release of DeepSeek, a freely available AI model from China, is only likely to expand the AI options. What is DeepSeek?

Peter (not his real name) is a product manager at a data storage company, which offers its people the Google Gemini AI chatbot. External AI tools are banned but Peter uses ChatGPT through search tool Kagi. He finds the biggest benefit of AI comes from challenging his thinking when he asks the chatbot to respond to his plans from different customer perspectives. ""The AI is not so much giving you answers, as giving you a sparring partner,"" he says. ""As a product manager, you have a lot of responsibility and don't have a lot of good outlets to discuss strategy openly. These tools allow that in an unfettered and unlimited capacity."" The version of ChatGPT he uses (4o) can analyse video. ""You can get summaries of competitors' videos and have a whole conversation [with the AI tool] about the points in the videos and how they overlap with your own products."" In a 10-minute ChatGPT conversation he can review material that would take two or three hours watching the videos. He estimates that his increased productivity is equivalent to the company getting a third of an additional person working for free. He's not sure why the company has banned external AI. ""I think it's a control thing,"" he says. ""Companies want to have a say in what tools their employees use. It's a new frontier of IT and they just want to be conservative.""

The use of unauthorized AI applications is sometimes called 'shadow AI'. It's a more specific version of 'shadow IT', which is when someone uses software or services the IT department hasn't approved. Harmonic Security helps to identify shadow AI and to prevent corporate data being entered into AI tools inappropriately. It is tracking more than 10,000 AI apps and has seen more than 5,000 of them in use. These include custom versions of ChatGPT and business software that has added AI features, such as communications tool Slack. However popular it is, shadow AI comes with risks. Modern AI tools are built by digesting huge amounts of information, in a process called training. Around 30% of the applications Harmonic Security has seen being used train using information entered by the user. That means the user's information becomes part of the AI tool and could be output to other users in the future. Companies may be concerned about their trade secrets being exposed by the AI tool's answers, but Alastair Paterson, CEO and co-founder of Harmonic Security, thinks that's unlikely. ""It's pretty hard to get the data straight out of these [AI tools],"" he says. However, firms will be concerned about their data being stored in AI services they have no control over, no awareness of, and which may be vulnerable to data breaches.

It will be hard for companies to fight against the use of AI tools, as they can be extremely useful, particularly for younger workers. ""[AI] allows you to cram five years' experience into 30 seconds of prompt engineering,"" says Simon Haighton-Williams, CEO at The Adaptavist Group, a UK-based software services group. ""It doesn't wholly replace [experience], but it's a good leg up in the same way that having a good encyclopaedia or a calculator lets you do things that you couldn't have done without those tools."" What would he say to companies that discover they have shadow AI use? ""Welcome to the club. I think probably everybody does. Be patient and understand what people are using and why, and figure out how you can embrace it and manage it rather than demand it's shut off. You don't want to be left behind as the organization that hasn't [adopted AI].""

Getty Images Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022

On March 21, 2006 the first ever tweet was posted by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey: ""Just setting up my twttr"". It was a simple introduction to a brand new platform. Backed by celebrities, it was different to other social media sites, like MySpace or Facebook, because you could interact with any user without them having to approve a request. Companies rushed to join the service, hoping to get closer to their customers. ""If you were a brand that wanted to be part of any cultural moments that were happening, Twitter was a great place to be,"" Alex Wilson, a senior strategist at the marketing agency Pitch tells BBC News. On June 4, 2010 Elon Musk, the owner of Space X, logged on for the first time: ""Please ignore prior tweets, as that was someone pretending to be me :) This is actually me."" Twelve years later he would buy the platform for $44bn (£38.1bn), reshape the algorithm, reinstate banned accounts, repurpose the policy around ""free speech"", and rename it X. He also fired thousands of staff - around 80% of the workforce.

Since Mr Musk's takeover companies have been choosing to leave the platform in what's been termed ""the great X-odus"". One of their main concerns was the content that would be seen around their posts that users could screengrab and share. For example, between June 2022 and February 2023 antisemitic posts on X doubled, according to research by the Institute of Strategic Dialogue. More recently in the UK, Mr Musk's posts about British politics have stirred up controversy. In particular, his posts on the subject of grooming gangs put pressure on the government, which announced a review of the issue. ""There is no doubt that Musk's ownership of X is having an impact on public opinion in the UK,"" Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common tells BBC News. However, according to More In Common, only 16% of Brits believe his interventions are designed to achieve justice for victims, whereas 44% think he is doing it for attention, and his approval rating with the British public sits at -35.

Pitch Marketing X has become ""less relevant"" across the world says Alex Wilson

The changing tone of X and the controversy surrounding its owner have spurred some firms to leave the platform and others have pulled their advertising as well. At the end of 2023 firms including Apple, IBM and Disney paused advertisement on the platform. Others brands including Unilever and Mars were sued by Mr Musk, who accused them of unlawfully agreeing to boycott the site. ""It's broadly fair to say Twitter is becoming less relevant across the world,"" Mr Wilson says in the Pitch office in central London, with posters of clients ranging from charities, telecommunications, and sports leagues. ""It's been a very long time since clients came to us and say: 'Twitter's fun and exciting. We want to be in that space'. ""Unless you are targeting specific audiences, maybe certain political audiences or sports - football is still big on Twitter - it's hard to see the value in it.""

Getty Images German football club FC St. Pauli left X in late 2024

Trump's election victory has prompted other organisations to leave X, with others considering their positions as Mr Musk's influence in the White House grows. Beginning in 2013, German football team FC St Pauli, which plays in Germany's top league, the Bundesliga, posted more than 60,000 times, racking up nearly 250,000 followers. But less than 10 days after Trump's return to the White House was confirmed, the club posted: ""You can find our statement about saying goodbye to X on BlueSky. Feel free to follow us there. We're out of here."" ""We discussed the decision for a year. We were mostly posting content with counter speech to hate. We had a lot of content for diversity, anti-racism, and anti-sexism,"" club spokesperson, Patrick Gensing told the BBC. ""We have seen assaults on X, antisemitism, conspiracy theories,"" he says. The argument that such posts are justified by freedom of speech, does not convince him. ""We don't think racism is freedom of speech,"" says Mr Gensing. One of the most recent departures from X was by the UK arm of BMW. In late January it announced it was no longer posting on X and directed people to its posts on Facebook and Instagram.

There's no definitive way to know how many brands are choosing to leave or reduce their posts on the platform. When approached, X did not respond to the points raised in this article. But last year Mr Musk claimed X had 600 million monthly active users, and said the platform maintains its ""purpose is to serve the public conversation"". Mr Musk ""has been clear that X is willing to make trade-offs to adopt a more open, less moderated approach compared to Twitter"", says Goran Calic, visiting scholar at Harvard Business School.

Daniel Stenberg Daniel Stenberg first released his open source software in 1996

Many of us have prepared instructions and critical information for our family in the event of our sudden demise. For Daniel Stenberg, that includes passwords for his Google and GitHub accounts. That’s because he’s the founder of curl, an open source internet transfer engine that has been downloaded billions of times and is used to transfer data to and from computer servers. It was first released by Mr Stenberg in 1996 and is now used by millions every day. It's important that someone is able to maintain curl when he steps away. “I just want to make sure that everything is there so the day I go away, someone can take over,” Mr Stenberg says.

It’s a problem confronting many of the open source software pioneers who transformed the technology world in the 1990s and early 2000s. Their ethos was that anyone could contribute to the development of an open source application or operating system – and the software and underlying code could be used, modified, and distributed for free. The open source movement broke the stranglehold of big technology companies, spurred innovation and underpins much of today’s technology landscape. In 1999, Loris Degioanni made his first contributions to an open source network analysis tool that eventually became Wireshark, as part of his master’s thesis. “My concern was graduating,” he says, not succession planning or the long-term future of the project. Almost 30 years on, Mr Degioanni is now CTO and founder of cybersecurity firm Sysdig, which is a key sponsor of Wireshark. “We're approaching the time when the founders of these early open source projects are starting to get old,” he says.

Sysdig Loris Degioanni has been working on open source software Wireshark since 1999

While projects do come and go, he explains, some remain relevant over the years, and founders and maintainers usually want to ensure they live on while there is demand. That’s not just because they’ve invested time in developing the code itself, but also because they have spawned communities, both virtual and in the real world. But while the likes of Mr Stenberg and Mr Degioanni can take action to ensure the keys to the kingdom are passed on, ensuring there is someone to pass them to can be a challenge. Many in the open source community worry there are not enough younger developers willing to get involved in contributing to or maintaining projects. This is often unpaid work after all.

Even Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, the operating system which kick-started the open source revolution in the early 1990s, noted at the Open Source Summit Europe in September that the “kernel maintainers are aging”. Amanda Brock, CEO of OpenUK, a non-profit organization which represents the UK’s open technology community, says younger developers might not appreciate the grip that closed software companies had in earlier decades. “You've got a next generation who haven't engaged as a philanthropic community and volunteer community in the same way, at the same scale.” There are technology barriers to address too. Many key open source projects were originally written in C, a coding language first developed in the early 1970s. While C is still taught in universities, it is no longer widely used in the commercial world, Mr Degioanni explains. “The fact that C is the main language makes it harder to attract a younger generation.”

OpenUK Amanda Brock says younger developers are not as active in the open source community

There are ways to work around this. Mr Degioanni says both Wireshark and a project he founded, Falco, rely on “plug-ins”, which can allow new functionality to be written in different languages. Mr Torvalds has given his blessing to the adoption of Rust as a programming language for Linux, while noting the “Rust versus C discussion has taken almost religious overtones in certain areas.” When it comes to steering projects into the future, leaders and maintainers have the option of handing over control to foundations. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, for example, oversees 208 projects, with more than 250,000 contributors. Wireshark has its own independent foundation, with Mr Degioanni as a board member.

Getty Images Will younger developers take on open source software?

Not everyone subscribes to the foundation model. Stenberg and his collaborators have kept curl completely independent. “I'm much better off without being in their neighbourhoods and just running my own neighbourhood,” he says. And foundations still face the issue of ensuring a steady supply of fresh developers to keep projects alive, he notes. Miss Brock says it’s essential that the open source community consider how it encourages younger people to participate. This is about showing that while being a contributor can be challenging it’s also career enhancing, giving young people an entry into established ecosystems and an opportunity to finesse and highlight their technical skills. “It's a way to help STEM talent flight,” Miss Brock adds. “Because people can work from home in the UK or whatever country they’re in.”",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly7n2jm5m5o,1

Deepali Misra-Sharp Dr Deepali Misra-Sharp uses AI to help take notes

This is the fifth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments. The difficulty of getting an appointment with a GP is a familiar gripe in the UK. Even when an appointment is secured, the rising workload faced by doctors means those meetings can be shorter than either the doctor or patient would like. But Dr Deepali Misra-Sharp, a GP partner in Birmingham, has found that AI has alleviated a chunk of the administration from her job, meaning she can focus more on patients. Dr Mirsa-Sharp started using Heidi Health, a free AI-assisted medical transcription tool that listens and transcribes patient appointments, about four months ago and says it has made a big difference. “Usually when I’m with a patient, I am writing things down and it takes away from the consultation,” she says. “This now means I can spend my entire time locking eyes with the patient and actively listening. It makes for a more quality consultation.” She says the tech reduces her workflow, saving her “two to three minutes per consultation, if not more”. She reels off other benefits: “It reduces the risk of errors and omissions in my medical note taking.""

With a workforce in decline while the number of patients continues to grow, GPs face immense pressure. A single full-time GP is now responsible for 2,273 patients, up 17% since September 2015, according to the British Medical Association (BMA). Could AI be the solution to help GP’s cut back on administrative tasks and alleviate burnout? Some research suggests it could. A 2019 report prepared by Health Education England estimated a minimal saving of one minute per patient from new technologies such as AI, equating to 5.7 million hours of GP time. Meanwhile, research by Oxford University in 2020, found that 44% of all administrative work in General Practice can now be either mostly or completely automated, freeing up time to spend with patients.

One company working on that is Denmark's Corti, which has developed AI that can listen to healthcare consultations, either over the phone or in person, and suggest follow-up questions, prompts, treatment options, as well as automating note taking. Corti says its technology processes about 150,000 patient interactions per day across hospitals, GP surgeries and healthcare institutions across Europe and the US, totalling about 100 million encounters per year. “The idea is the physician can spend more time with a patient,” says Lars Maaløe, co-founder and chief technology officer at Corti. He says the technology can suggest questions based on previous conversations it has heard in other healthcare situations. “The AI has access to related conversations and then it might think, well, in 10,000 similar conversations, most questions asked X and that has not been asked,” says Mr Maaløe. “I imagine GPs have one consultation after another and so have little time to consult with colleagues. It’s giving that colleague advice.” He also says it can look at the historical data of a patient. “It could ask, for example, did you remember to ask if the patient is still suffering from pain in the right knee?”

But do patients want technology listening to and recording their conversations? Mr Maaløe says “the data is not leaving system”. He does say it is good practice to inform the patient, though. “If the patient contests it, the doctor cannot record. We see few examples of that as the patient can see better documentation.” Dr Misra-Sharp says she lets patients know she has a listening device to help her take notes. “I haven’t had anyone have a problem with that yet, but if they did, I wouldn’t do it.”

C the signs C the Signs software is used to analyse a patients medical record

Meanwhile, currently, 1,400 GP practices across England are using the C the Signs, a platform which uses AI to analyse patients’ medical records and check different signs, symptoms and risk factors of cancer, and recommend what action should be taken. “It can capture symptoms, such as cough, cold, bloating, and essentially in a minute it can see if there’s any relevant information from their medical history,” says C the Signs chief executive and co-founder Dr Bea Bakshi, who is also a GP. The AI is trained on published medical research papers. “For example, it might say the patient is at risk of pancreatic cancer and would benefit from a pancreatic scan, and then the doctor will decide to refer to those pathways,” says Dr Bakshi. “It won’t diagnose, but it can facilitate.” She says they have conducted more than 400,000 cancer risk assessments in a real-world setting, detecting more than 30,000 patients with cancer across more than 50 different cancer types.

An AI report published by the BMA this year found that “AI should be expected to transform, rather than replace, healthcare jobs by automating routine tasks and improving efficiency”. In a statement, Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of General Practice Committee UK at the BMA, said: ""We recognise that AI has the potential to transform NHS care completely - but if not enacted safely, it could also cause considerable harm. AI is subject to bias and error, can potentially compromise patient privacy and is still very much a work-in-progress. ""Whilst AI can be used to enhance and supplement what a GP can offer as another tool in their arsenal, it's not a silver bullet. We cannot wait on the promise of AI tomorrow, to deliver the much-needed productivity, consistency and safety improvements needed today.”",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdd026lgmdmo,1

Insilico Medicine Dr Alex Zhavoronkov uses AI to uncover useful molecules

This is the fourth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments. Over a video call, Alex Zhavoronkov holds up a small, green, diamond-shaped pill. It has been developed by his company to treat a rare progressive lung disease for which there is no known cause or cure. The new drug has yet to be approved, but in small clinical trials has shown impressive efficacy in treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). It's one of a new wave of drugs where artificial intelligence (AI) has been integral to its discovery. ""We can't say we have the first AI discovered and designed molecule approved,"" says Dr Zhavoronkov, the co-founder and CEO of US-based start-up Insilico Medicine. ""But we may be the furthest along the path."" Welcome to the great AI drug race, where a host of companies are employing the power of AI to do what has traditionally been the job of medicinal chemists. That includes both smaller, specialist AI-driven biotech companies, which have sprung up over the past decade, and larger pharmaceutical firms who are either doing the research themselves, or in partnership with smaller firms.

Among the newer players is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which launched UK-based AI drug discovery company Isomorphic Labs, in late 2021. Its CEO, Demis Hassabis, shared this year's Nobel prize in chemistry for an AI model that is expected to be useful for AI drug design. Using AI to do drug discovery could make an ""enormous difference"" for patients, says Chris Meier, of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG). Bringing a new drug to market takes on average 10 to 15 years, and costs more than $2bn (£1.6bn). It's also risky: about 90% of drugs that go into clinical trials fail. The hope is that using AI for the drug discovery part of that process could cut the time and cost, and result in more success. A new era, where AI is at the centre of the drug discovery process is emerging, says Charlotte Deane, a professor of structural bioinformatics at Oxford University, who develops freely available AI tools to help pharmaceutical companies and others improve their drug discovery. ""We are at the beginning of just how good that might be,"" she says. It is unlikely to lead to fewer pharmaceutical scientists, say experts - the real savings will come if there are fewer failures - but it will mean working in partnership with AI.

Insilico Medicine Insilico Medicine has six molecules in clinical trials

A recently published analysis by BCG found at least 75 ""AI-discovered molecules"" have entered clinical trials with many more expected. ""That they are now routinely going into clinical trials is a major milestone,"" says Dr Meier. The next – and ""even bigger milestone"" – will be when they start to come out the other end. However, Prof Deane notes that there is no definition yet of what exactly counts as an ""AI discovered"" drug and, in all the examples to date, there has still been lots of human involvement. There are two steps within the drug discovery process where AI is being most heavily deployed explains Dr Meier. The first is in identifying, at the molecular level, the therapeutic target that it is intended the drug will act to correct, such as a certain gene or protein being altered by the disease in a way it shouldn't. While traditionally scientists test potential targets in the lab experimentally, based on what they understand of a disease, AI can be trained to mine large databases to make connections between the underlying molecular biology and the disease and make suggestions. The second, and more common, is in designing the drug to correct the target. This employs generative AI, also the basis of ChatGPT, to imagine molecules that might bind to the target and work, replacing the expensive manual process of chemists synthesising many hundreds of variations of the same molecule and trying them to find the optimal one.

Insilico Medicine, founded in 2014 and which has received more than $425m in funding, used AI for both steps, as well as to predict the probability of success in clinical trials which it then feeds back into its drug discovery work. Currently the firm has six molecules in clinical trials, including to treat IPF for which the next phase of trials is being planned. In addition four molecules have been cleared to enter trials, and nearly 30 others are showing promise. All have been ""discovered from scratch using generative AI"", says Dr Zhavoronkov. ""Our machines dream until they come up with a perfect drug that fits all our criteria."" The novel molecule to treat IPF was designed by the company's generative AI software after it was given the objective of inhibiting a protein called TNIK, which has never been targeted before for treating IPF, but was suggested by another set of the company's AI software as the most likely regulator of the disease. Possibilities suggested by the system were then synthesised and tested. The discovery process was far quicker and leaner than standard for the industry, notes Dr Zhavoronkov. It took 18 months and required synthesis and testing of 79 molecules, where usually it would be expected to take about four years and at least the synthesis of 500. Other of Insilco's molecules have even lower numbers, he says.

Russia jails four journalists for alleged links to Alexei Navalny anti-corruption group,"A Russian court has convicted four journalists of extremism for working for an anti-corruption group founded by the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny and sentenced them to five and a half years in prison each.

Antonina Favorskaya, Konstantin Gabov, Sergey Karelin and Artyom Kriger were found guilty of involvement with a group that had been labelled as extremist. All four had maintained their innocence, arguing they were being prosecuted for doing their jobs as journalists.

The closed-door trial was part of a crackdown on dissent that has reached an unprecedented scale since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022.

The authorities have targeted opposition figures, independent journalists, rights activists and ordinary Russians critical of the Kremlin with prosecution, jailing hundreds and prompting thousands to flee the country.

Favorskaya and Kriger worked with Sota Vision, an independent Russian news outlet that covers protests and political trials. Gabov is a freelance producer who has worked for multiple organisations, including Reuters. Karelin, a freelance video journalist, has done work for western media outlets including the Associated Press.

The four journalists were accused of working with Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, which was designated as extremist and outlawed in 2021 in a move widely seen as politically motivated.

Navalny was Vladimir Putin’s fiercest and most prominent critic and relentlessly campaigned against official corruption in Russia. Navalny died in February 2024 in an Arctic penal colony while serving a 19-year sentence for several charges, including running an extremist group, which he had rejected as politically driven.

Favorskaya said at an earlier court appearance open to the public that she was being prosecuted for a story she wrote on abuse Navalny had faced behind bars. Speaking to reporters from the defendants’ cage before the verdict, she also said she was punished for helping to organise Navalny’s funeral.

Gabov, in a closing statement prepared for court that was published by the independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper, said the accusations against him were groundless and the prosecution had failed to prove them.

“I understand perfectly well … what kind of country I live in. Throughout history, Russia has never been different, there is nothing new in the current situation,” Gabov said in the statement. “Independent journalism is equated to extremism.”

Supporters who gathered in the court building chanted and applauded as the four journalists were led out of the courtroom after the verdict.

The journalists’ lawyers said they would appeal against the verdict, which Kriger’s lawyer, Yelena Sheremetyeva, described as illegal and unfair.

“The profession of a journalist in itself is not extremism,” said Irina Biryukova. “And based on the case materials that are available, I will say that in our opinion, there is no evidence that they committed any crimes, or even minor offences.”

DWP to overhaul carer’s allowance checks after overpayment scandal,"Ministers have announced an overhaul of the way carer’s allowance overpayments are checked in an attempt to fix the failing system which has left thousands with life-changing debts,fines and criminal records.

In a significant policy change, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has been ordered to hire extra staff to investigate 100% of the carer’s allowance earnings breach alerts it receives and swiftly notify carers if they are at risk of falling into debt.

Last year, the Guardian revealed that for the last six years, the DWP has chosen to investigate just 50% of alerts on cost grounds – even though this has led to huge numbers of carers unknowingly accruing massive overpayments.

Campaigners are optimistic the move could, over time, significantly reduce the numbers of carers falling foul of the system – but warned thousands more will be unfairly hit by overpayments as huge backlogs of alerts are processed over the next few months.

Carers in England and Wales who breach carer’s allowance earnings limits of £196 a week must return the full £83.30 a week benefit payment, a “cliff edge” penalty that means going £1 a week over the limit for one year would result in the claimant being hit with a repayment demand not of £52, but £4,330.

The DWP’s dogged refusal over many years to properly check the real-time alerts of carer’s earnings it gets from HMRC and use the data in timely manner to prevent carers unwittingly running up overpayments has been a central feature of the carer’s allowance scandal, exposed in a series of Guardian articles over the past year.

Critics have accused DWP of in effect creating a lottery in which some carers are alerted to earnings breaches after a few weeks while others are allowed to accrue years of overpayments before being asked to repay large sums, in some cases as high as £20,000, causing widespread financial and emotional distress.

An independent government-commissioned review of the carer’s allowance is expected to report in the summer. The review, which will look at how the overpayment scandal came about and how to fix it, is part of what ministers have promised will be a “new settlement” for carers.

The chief executive of Carers UK, Helen Walker, welcomed the move: “When the alerts target was set at 50%, thousands of carers were missed and experienced large and damaging overpayments, in a situation that could have been largely avoided,” she said.

But she warned that until the new policy took effect, tens of thousands more carers would continue to be hit with overpayments, including an estimated 20,000 at risk when a huge backlog of paper-based alerts related to national insurance credits, which the DWP allowed to build up, is finally tackled.

“As the DWP works to clear the current backlog, the human cost of a system which needed an overhaul years ago will still continue to rise. Sadly, clearing the backlog is likely to result in a further rise in overpayments debts,” said Walker.

The government’s current position, outlined in a letter to charities last week by the social security minister, Sir Stephen Timms, indicated the handling of overpayments would be “business as usual” and there would be no pause on repayment demands, fines, or potential prosecutions for fraud.

The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, called for carer’s allowance overpayments to be written off, saying it was wrong carers continued to be punished by a system the government admitted was broken. “It is totally unacceptable that more and more carers are being caught up in this scandal, so long after it was exposed,” he said.

A DWP spokesperson said: “We are drafting in extra staff so the backlog of all under- and overpayments are investigated promptly and corrected. We will agree affordable repayment plans and, when issuing debt management notifications, signpost to independent advice services.”

Campaigners have long argued the complexity of carer’s allowance rules meant carers who worked part-time were unaware when they breached weekly earnings limits, often by only a few pounds or pence, and that the DWP should use the earnings data it had at its disposal to warn them in timely fashion so they could make adjustments.

Although the DWP promised MPs six years ago the introduction of electronic earnings alerts from HMRC would eradicate overpayments, it has repeatedly neglected to deploy enough staff to carry out the checks. Overpayments have continued to spiral, with 144,000 carers currently repaying over £250m.

The National Audit Office revealed in December that DWP policy was to investigate half of all alerts on the grounds this was the maximum it needed to process to meet its internal financial savings targets.

Timms said: “Carer’s allowance alerts have been coming in to the department, but many haven’t been processed. In future, we plan to act on all of them. This will be an important step in reducing overpayments.

“We are delivering on the change we promised when elected by drafting in extra staff. Reviewing 100% of alerts will allow us to tackle overpayments when they arise, rather than waiting until carers have built up large debts.”",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/15/dwp-overhaul-carers-allowance-checks-overpayment-scandal,1

"Increased bills for higher earners could fund UK energy upgrade, Ofgem says","Wealthier households could be made to shoulder higher costs for running and upgrading the UK’s network of energy cables and pipes to help low-income bill payers under new plans to be considered this summer.

The proposals could mean that high-income households will pay more via the standing charge on their energy bills, while those who are not in work or are on low pay are charged a discounted rate.

The energy regulator, Ofgem, is expected to consult the industry on the proposals as part of a root-and-branch review into how the costs of upgrading Britain’s energy networks can be recovered through home energy bills in a way that is fairer.

Jonathan Brearley, the chief executive of Ofgem, told an industry briefing the “wide-ranging examination” of how to allocate the energy industry’s costs would “raise the question of whether there is a more progressive way to pay”.

He told reporters this would include investigating whether there were ways to attach the final cost that households pay to their household income.

“It’s a question that we need to answer as we go through this transition and as we think hard about getting to a place we want to get to,” he said.

Under the current system, the cost of maintaining the wires and cables that deliver the gas and electricity to homes and businesses is recouped through standing charges on home energy bills. These fixed daily charges, which also include the cost of fitting smart meters and other policy costs, are applied to energy bills whether you use any energy or not.

This means cash-strapped households who are unable to heat their homes still bear the full brunt of covering energy network costs. Vulnerable consumers who are often high users of energy – for medical or health needs – also end up paying above the odds to maintain the grid.

The standing charge has ballooned in recent years, and the cost could climb further as the UK prepares to invest heavily in upgrading its electricity grids to meet the government’s goal of creating a clean energy system by 2030. The charge averaged £182.27 a year five years ago and has climbed to an average of £334.07 a year – or nearly a fifth of the average annual energy bill.

The consumer champion Martin Lewis has described the charges as “a moral hazard, disincentivising lower users from cutting their bills”, saying they are “by far the biggest single subject of complaint I get from the public about energy bills”.

The network costs were initially moved into the standing charges in 2022 and 2023 so that affluent households who could afford to fit their own solar panels, and thus use less energy from the grid, would still pay their share of its maintenance.

The regulator’s previous analysis has shown that if the electricity standing charge was included in the overall unit rates that apply to how much energy is used, then about 5.5 million low-income households who are able to use less energy could benefit by £44 a year.

But the same analysis found that another 1.2 million low-income households who are unable to rein in their energy use – due to a draughty home or the need to run medical equipment – would pay £88 a year more by switching to a higher unit rate that includes the network costs.

“Inevitably there are big pros and cons and big operational challenges before any final decision could be made,” Brearley said.",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/apr/15/increased-bills-for-higher-earners-could-fund-uk-energy-upgrade-ofgem-says,1
Felling of ancient London oak tree by Toby Carvery owner reported to police,"The sudden felling of one of the oldest and largest oak trees in London has been carried out by the company that owns a nearby Toby Carvery, as campaigners renewed calls for better protection for such nationally significant trees.

The oak in Whitewebbs Park, Enfield, was up to 500 years old, with a trunk that was more than six metres in circumference. It was listed on the Woodland Trust inventory of ancient trees, but was not the subject of a tree preservation order.

The tree was felled earlier this month by contractors working for Mitchells & Butlers Retail (MBR), which runs the nearby Toby Carvery and leases the land where the tree stood from Enfield council.

The council said it had not been informed of the decision to cut down the tree and urged the Metropolitan police to investigate. The council leader, Ergin Erbil, said: “We are treating the matter as criminal damage and have reported it to the police.”

It is understood that on Tuesday the Metropolitan police closed an investigation into the incident after deciding it was a civil matter.

The council has placed a tree preservation order on the remaining trunk in the hope that it may grow back.

A spokesperson for MBR said its contractors had warned that the tree was diseased. They said: “The tree was cut back after we were advised by our specialist arboriculture contractors that it caused a potential health and safety risk.

“This was an important action to protect our employees and guests as well as the wider general public, to whom we have a duty of care.

“We took necessary measures to ensure any legal requirements were met. We are grateful to our specialist arboriculture contractors for warning us of this potential health and safety risk, allowing us to act swiftly to address it.”

Campaigners have expressed dismay at the incident. Writing on X, Paul Powlesland, co-founder of the Lawyers for Nature, said: “This shows the desperate need for better protections for our veteran and ancient trees. A building the same age as this tree would almost certainly be listed (council owned or not), and we should have an equivalent system for trees, with equivalent enforcement and punishment.”

Adam Cormack, head of campaigning at the Woodland Trust, said it was “a reminder to all of us that not every ancient tree is in a safe place”.

He added: “It is very unusual to see the felling of an oak tree of this size and age. Legally protected status for trees like the Whitewebbs oak is long overdue. This issue has widespread public support and is an open goal for the government to act upon.”

The trust is campaigning for legislation that would make a list of nationally important heritage trees the subject of preservation orders.

Later this month, the trial of two men accused of felling the Sycamore Gap tree is due to take place at Newcastle crown court.

Experts say ancient oaks have more ecological value than sycamores because they support hundreds more species.

A blogpost by the tree company Thor’s Trees says: “Ancient trees like this one are living ecosystems in themselves. This oak was a lapsed pollard, a sign of historical land management, left to mature over centuries into a vast and unique habitat. Its sheer size and age meant it was home to hundreds of species, many of which rely solely on old trees like this to survive.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/15/felling-of-ancient-london-oak-tree-reported-to-police,1
‘Cutting DEI won’t fill potholes’: Labour ready to play long game against Farage,"It was, a Labour official hastily explained, “just one front page”. But for Nigel Farage it was quite a front page: a banner headline in the Sun proclaiming “Britain is broken”, the exact slogan Reform UK is using for May’s local elections.

Inside the paper was not an actual endorsement for Reform, but something that felt as if it could be a precursor to one – details of polling that showed Farage is more trusted than Keir Starmer by “red wall” voters on key issues, with his party level-pegging with Labour for support.

This was the perfect lead-up to Farage’s biggest speech yet in the local election campaign, in which he proclaimed that Reform’s tanks were “on the lawns of the red wall” and directly targeting Labour, with the Conservatives dismissed as finished.

It has been well documented how seriously Starmer’s team, as well as some Labour MPs, treat Reform UK as a threat. But at the same time it is a more complicated picture than Farage would like to present, with arguably as many pitfalls as opportunities ahead for his party.

To begin with, while Farage billed the poll as showing Reform stealing Labour voters, the detailed tables told a different story. Of people who said they would vote Reform on 1 May, just 8% had backed Labour in the 2021 local elections, while nearly 40% voted Conservative.

This discrepancy was pointed out to Farage during a media Q&A after his speech, prompting a slightly peevish response, which avoided the point.

Another slightly grumpy moment came when Farage explicitly took on Labour criticisms of him as untrustworthy on the NHS and friendly to Vladimir Putin, calling the latter “the old Russia conspiracy theory”.

Labour aides believe this shows Farage realises he is vulnerable on both issues. “He can try to airbrush history as much as he likes, but he said those fawning things about Putin on the record, and they have aged very badly,” one said.

Another potential vulnerability, which Labour is not yet explicitly targeting, was highlighted when Farage was asked how a future Reform government would pay for its promised swathe of tax cuts. He responded with some high-grade waffle about new manufacturing jobs and abolishing quangos.

This often difficult transition from insurgent political force to actual ruling party could come into early focus if, as polling suggests, Reform wins control of some councils, almost certainly more from the Tories than Labour.

Expect Labour to keep a close watch on any Reform-run councils, and to pummel them as routinely as it has done when the Greens have done the same.

“Saying you’ll cut diversity and inclusion to save money won’t cut it when you’ve got a council to run,” a Labour official said. “You can trim all the DEI programmes you like, but that won’t fill the potholes or magic up any SEND pupil places.”

Mention of diversity programmes – which Farage did several times – brings in a particularly big imponderable: as he receives more scrutiny, how will voters take to his fairly unfiltered, high-octane UK version of Trumpism?

Farage’s speech on Tuesday gave plenty of examples of this, not least his condemnation of members of the National Education Union as Marxists who are “poisoning the minds of our kids”. Going to war with the biggest teaching union might be popular with Reform members, but many everyday voters know and admire teachers, and might find this a bit quixotic, or insulting, or both.

Similarly, some of Farage’s words on diversity, including that such policies disadvantage “white people with more history in this country” than those from ethnic minorities, will be seen by some as crossing a line from dog whistle to foghorn.

Ultimately, however, Labour realises that this is a much longer game than one newspaper front page or a single set of local elections.

“We will keep punching the bruises over Putin and the NHS, and while it’s probably too early in the cycle now, at some point the issue of fiscal credibility will become more and more important,” the Labour official said.

“But ultimately it’s about us delivering on things that people notice, whether it’s the money in their pocket, GP appointments or potholes.”",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/apr/15/labour-long-game-nigel-farage-reform-uk,1
‘I sent AI to art school!’ The postmodern master who taught a machine to beef up his old work,"By the time you read this article, there’s a good chance it will have already been scanned by an artificially intelligent machine. If asked about the artist David Salle, large language models such as ChatGPT or Gemini may repurpose some of the words below to come up with their answer. The bigger the data set, the more convincing the response – and Salle has been written about exhaustively since he first rose to art world stardom in the 1980s. The question is whether AI can ever say anything new about the artist and his work, or if it’s for ever condemned to generate more of the same.

A similar question lingers beneath the surface of the paintings that Salle has been making since 2023, a new series of which he has just unveiled at Thaddaeus Ropac in London. His New Pastorals were made with the aid of machine-learning software, though that’s not immediately apparent from looking at them. Each monumental canvas bears broad, gestural strokes of oil paint seemingly applied by the artist’s own hand. Close study however reveals large patches of flat, digitally printed underpainting. This is the mark of the AI model which Salle has been training to generate his work – or at least something uncannily close to it.

The tool can synthesise things in a matter of seconds. This evolution in painterly terms might take decades

This machinic collaboration began with a game. Salle has long been sceptical of digital painting tools, writing in 2015 that “the web’s frenetic sprawl is opposite to the type of focus required to make a painting, or, for that matter, to look at one”. Nonetheless, there is a sprawling quality to his own paintings, which layer images from such a wide range of pop and art historical references that the eye often doesn’t know where to rest. In 2021, Salle got the idea to develop a virtual game that would allow players to rearrange those painted elements using drag-and-drop tools.

Although the tech proved impractical, in the process Salle met Danika Laszuk, a software engineer at the tech startup EAT__Works, and Grant Davis, creator of the AI-powered sketchpad app Wand. Together they fed an AI image generator work by artists whose technique Salle considers foundational – Andy Warhol for colour, Edward Hopper for volume, Giorgio de Chirico for perspective, Arthur Dove for line – then asked it to produce images based on specific text prompts. “What I did was send the machine to art school,” Salle says.

At first the machine was not a model student. Eerie, cartoonish figures with unnatural sheen recalled the images produced by OpenAI’s Dall-E Mini. “What’s so fundamentally unsatisfying about this kind of digital imagery?” Salle wondered. The answer, he felt, resided along the edges of its forms. “Because it’s only pixels, there’s no real differentiation between the edge of something and the thing behind it,” he explains. “There’s no way to make the edge meaningful, and in representational painting, those edges carry such a large amount of information about an artist’s style.” So he fed the machine scans of gouaches he had been making and watched the AI respond to their watery edges. “It could read the physicality of the brush stroke,” he recalls. “It fundamentally changed the machine’s way of thinking about itself.”

Salle has taught at various institutions over the years, and this process felt a bit like a feedback session at an art school. Except the AI model is a very fast learner, and within a few sessions it could generate images that Salle might have come up with himself, if he’d only had more time. “The machine can synthesise things in a matter of seconds,” he says. “This evolution in painterly terms might take years or even decades.”

Born in Oklahoma but raised in Wichita, Kansas, Salle was the model of precocity when he burst on to the New York scene in 1980. By 1987, he was one of the most highly valued painters of his generation, and at age 34 became the youngest artist to ever have a mid-career survey at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Such a stratospheric rise meant Salle’s market had further to fall once figurative painting was no longer in fashion, but the artist continued to labour on ever more ambitious series, including the troublesome suite of paintings at the heart of the New Pastorals. Now, figurative painting is back with a vengeance, and Salle has met the moment – or, perhaps, the moment has met him.

To produce his latest works, Salle trained the AI on the dozen sweeping Pastorals he completed between 1999 and 2000. Landscape paintings through the looking glass, they feature a couple idling by a lake, copied from a 19th-century opera scrim, rendered in harlequin colours and overlaid with inset images and designs of wildly differing styles. These vistas almost look like they were edited in Photoshop, but Salle rendered them entirely analogue. “The first thing they teach you in colour painting classes is how to establish your palette,” he recalls. “I was really showing off. I thought, ‘I can make a painting with three separate colour palettes work and you can’t stop me.’”

Initial reviews of the Pastorals were mixed. Some critics described them as cold and emotionless, a charge often levied at Salle, whose demeanour can be as remote and cerebral as his paintings. “The result seems more a jumble of ingredients than a thoroughly cooked dish,” David Frankel wrote in Artforum.

With the New Pastorals, however, something seems to have changed. The brushstrokes are looser, faster and thicker, more abstract expressionist than anything else Salle has ever done. Their subject matter, meanwhile, is totally helter skelter, as if Salle has pulsed his older paintings in a blender. Headless bodies zoom in and out of the frame. Objects no longer seem attached to solid ground. Unnervingly, these works look more hand-painted than their referents, at least until you draw closer to their surface, where the paint is so thin in some areas that it could only have been applied by a machine.

Salle always felt he hadn’t finished with the Pastorals, though he says there were other reasons why they were a good match for his AI experiment. “I realised that those paintings would give the machine material that it would understand in its own way,” he explains. “It took all these faceted shapes with different colour harmonies, and it just went to town with them – but kept the DNA of the transition, the horizon line, the mountains, the water, the couple and the figures, and then overlaid that with brushstroke edges.”

Wand app creator Davis considers the introduction of the Pastorals a breakthrough moment for the model, as it required a new technique “which basically takes an image and abstracts the content on a conceptual level in order to recreate different variations”. In other words, the machine began to digest Salle’s paintings on a formal level. The Pastorals may also have been well suited to the task because the genre of landscape painting – and especially theatrical backdrops – resembles certain digital technologies in its production of illusionistic space. The New Pastorals reject the art historical imperative to create depth in a flat painting.

Salle can tell the AI model to produce something that resembles his own work to greater or lesser degrees. “Fundamentally, it’s a lever that runs along a continuum: one end is similar and the other end is dissimilar,” he explains. “Depending on where you position the lever, the results will either be very close to what you have started with, or it’ll be wildly distorted.”

The trees, mountains and idling couple from his original Pastorals are still visible in the backdrop of Red Scarf, for instance, but are now painted semi-abstractly behind a woman wearing a neckerchief. A floating stack of teacups anchors the composition in an otherwise turbulent space, much like the nails that Picasso and Braque painted on to their Cubist still lifes. The many fragmented, colliding bodies in Stack, on the other hand, are much harder to decode. “I’ll select an image that’s very eccentric precisely to provoke myself to do something that I probably would not have done otherwise,” Salle says.

Nonetheless, the artist isn’t worried that AI will ever outpace or replace him. He sees it as another tool, like a brush or an easel. “I don’t think the machine’s taught me very much at all,” Salle declares. “I haven’t reconsidered how I think about pictorial space or composition. I’m simply taking what the machine offers after I’ve told it what I want.”

In some sense, his postmodern paintings are perfectly suited to such an experiment: sampling omnivorously from so many subjects and styles, they seem less concerned with their original sources than gleefully unbothered by the concept of originality altogether. In 1985, when Salle was at the height of his fame, the art historian Rosalind Krauss dismissed originality as a “modernist myth”; every work of art borrows from other sources, whether it acknowledges them or not. At least in their process, human artists may not differ so much from their robot kin.

What AI might borrow from Salle is another question. The data collected by EAT__Works is proprietary, so his feedback won’t fuel any other artist-machines in the near future, though photographs of his new paintings, uploaded to the gallery’s public website, could conceivably be used as prompts for further AI-generated images. “In theory our model could autonomously spawn images,” Davis admits, though “the best images come from a technique that is very hands-on”. For now, AI still needs humans to train it – that is, until the student becomes the teacher.",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/apr/15/david-salle-ai-art-school-postmodern-master,1

I’ve never seen a book by the independent British book publisher Fitzcarraldo Editions that I didn’t like (although I’m nowhere near brave enough to attempt Zone by Mathias Énard, which the New Yorker described as “a five-hundred-and-twenty-one-page novel written in a single swoon of a sentence”). Best of all, they have lovely covers – in International Klein blue. There’s also a highly covetable tote bag in the same shade.

This beautiful and fun Ghanaian chameleon door knocker is as much a gift for those lucky enough to visit your home as for yourself. The postman will be happier, your neighbour will have a chuckle.

I can’t go everywhere my daughter goes – and it’s heartbreaking,"We met K when she was a week old. We were foster parents and not expecting a call about a newborn. Despite becoming her mom with just 12 hours’ notice – we adopted her the next year – my early months with her felt so natural.

I had been disabled for six years. While on a hike, I developed dysautonomia, which is secondary to a genetic connective tissue disorder called hEDS [hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]. I experience a great deal of daily pain and can’t stand for more than a minute or sit upright unsupported for more than five.

As a result, I spend most of my day reclined. Her high need for physical contact in infancy fit my need to rest all day. She didn’t need a mom who could pace. She needed a mom who didn’t get bored lying on the sofa. We were a perfect match.

After a few months with K, we started to make plans. The first was a trip to a small island called Lummi off the coast of Washington state. We flew out of Oakland; a friend drove us to the airport and helped us check the bags. David pushed me in my wheelchair, and I carried K on my lap. Once in the air, we learned the hard way that air pressure changes can contribute to diaper blowouts, but the flight was, generally, fine.

When we arrived in Seattle, David pushed K and me to the corner of the baggage claim area and returned to watch for our bags while I bottle-fed her. Once David had our suitcases, he dropped them off with us in the corner and left to get our rental car. Returning an hour later with the car, he parked out front, came in and retrieved the bags, and then, finally, two hours after landing, brought K and me to the car. A few extra steps, but manageable.

Our week on Lummi was heaven. I read so many books that I joined the local library so that I could check out more. At night, I drank IPAs and ate Oreos under the stars. During the afternoons, K and I lounged on a picnic blanket, listening to the waves.

But the return trip was the first time I felt what would become a familiar sinking shame about my disability complicating our life as parents. Due to a few car complications, we were cutting it close to make our flight. There was no bag check. I had been using a wheelchair in airports for years and knew that an airport attendant would push me to the gate if I requested it. I suggested to David that we ask someone at the airport to push me while I carried K so that David could manage our bags.

When the person arrived, they told me I couldn’t carry K on my lap. They said it was airport policy that a baby couldn’t ride on a wheelchair (never mind that it was my wheelchair, my lap, and my baby). So now David needed to find a way to push our suitcases and carry K simultaneously – which was impossible, and our flight was about to leave. The attendant left, and we scrambled for solutions.

We called the attendant back and asked him to push me. I would drag our suitcases, and David would carry K. We inched our way through the airport. I am not strong enough to hold my arms out to the side and push suitcases; before long, I had moved the bags in front of me, pushing them with my feet. It was difficult – they zigged and zagged, unwieldy and slow.

We made our flight. We made it home. But the humiliation of not being allowed to carry my baby continued to burn.

As K grew older, the list of places she needed or wanted to go expanded.

She started ballet, and I couldn’t last an hour propped on the hard wooden floor. She started daycare, and dropping her off required a long walk up a steep driveway. She wanted to visit the zoo and the playground and the children’s discovery museum.

Part of how I adapted to her expanding world was to get a power wheelchair. I needed to be able to recline; the 450-lb chair does that and more. In many ways, the solution was effective. I attended ballet classes. We went to the playground. We fed the cows at the little farm in the Berkeley Hills. But a 450lb wheelchair only works in spaces that are wheelchair accessible. When we go somewhere with stairs, I can’t bring my chair. I can walk up a few stairs, but if the seating at the top isn’t accessible, I must leave after only a few minutes.

For some disabled or chronically ill people, leaving the house isn’t possible at all. But for others, the barriers are structural.

K is now six. Below is a non-exhaustive list of places she has gone but where, because of inaccessibility, I haven’t been able to join:

Her kindergarten classroom. In fact, the entirety of the school she attended for two years.

Countless hikes.

Multiple preschool tours – so many schools in California, North Carolina and Ontario are up or down stairs.

Field trips.

Nearly every shop and restaurant in Montreal while on a family vacation.

Birthday and holiday parties.

Most playgrounds with sand or gravel.

In an ambulance, twice.

In particular, being separated on the ambulance rides devastated me. The first time we called 911, K wasn’t yet two and had been sick with pneumonia; the EMTs arrived quickly, assessed K’s status, and said she needed to get to Oakland’s Children’s hospital urgently.

“Who’s coming?” they asked, looking between David and me, as they attached sensors to my tiny baby. Saying I couldn’t go with her to the hospital as she struggled to breathe felt like tearing an organ from my body. But my wheelchair wouldn’t fit inside the ambulance.

David is a kind and attentive dad. K did not suffer for having David in the ambulance. But I did. I walked outside as they loaded my baby and turned on the sirens, which faded as they sped down the hill. Our house, which had minutes before been loud and busy with equipment and people and uniforms and alarms, was silent. Shaking, I went back inside to figure out how to get myself to the hospital with my wheelchair. I called my neighbor and could barely speak through my tears. He answered, and within minutes, we were en route to the hospital.

About a year later, K again became sick with a minor cold that turned to be pneumonia and worsened quickly. We were different parents by that point; after a year of monitoring her respiratory rate, oxygen percentages, and trachea tugs, we knew exactly what to watch for.

Even with all our vigilance, K experienced a rapid decline only hours after visiting her pediatrician. Like the first time, my gut knew before my brain, and when I called the after-hours nurse’s line, I knew what they would say: “Call 911 immediately.”

Just like the time before, our apartment went from quiet and tense to brimming with noise and commotion. David, K and I were on our king-sized bed, thermometers and oxygen monitors surrounding us, when the EMTs entered. The paramedics checked K’s vital signs, and their demeanors changed. “Signs of sepsis,” one reported. “Hurry.”

And just like that, they were running, K on a stretcher, David hurrying behind. The silence they left behind was eerie. I knew what sepsis could mean for a baby and all I wanted was to be with my child to ensure that no one made a life-threatening mistake. To demand that every person pay undivided attention to K.

Alone in my apartment, I remembered that, in my 20s, I had helped the chief of emergency medicine at the closest major hospital buy a home. He and I had connected in the process, and I had joined him and his wife, an infectious disease doctor, on their boat to celebrate after. It had been years since we had talked, and a lot had changed, including my disability and becoming a parent. I picked up my phone, found his contact, and called.

“It’s Jessica, your old realtor. I have a child now, and she is in an ambulance on the way to the emergency room, and the paramedics said it might be sepsis. K is in respiratory distress.” I was weeping, and my hands shook, but I got the words out. He was calm and kind and said he would call the attending on duty to make sure everyone acted quickly and would keep me in the loop. I was doing all I could to save my baby. I would have done anything.

Hanging up the phone, the adrenaline took over, and I barely made it to the bathroom before vomiting.

K was OK. It wasn’t sepsis, thank goodness. She recovered from the respiratory distress at home while I watched her chest rise and fall. But seeing her disappear into the ambulance had felt like someone pulling my heart up and out of my throat.

Disabled parents’ caregiving abilities are optimized in our homes. But when we leave the house, the obstacles multiply. For one, the built environment is often inaccessible and inhospitable for individual bodies and minds. Secondly, when not in our homes we see other people – and people, through words and actions, create a different kind of hostile environment.

Many parents my age remember our childhoods in the 80s and 90s and compare the risks of our childhoods to the safety expectations of parents today. It’s hard to imagine a child today being tossed around in the trunk of a station wagon or roaming the neighborhood for hours before the age of 10. Risk calculation is complex, and I am certainly not one to elevate the experience of the “good old days” – good? For who? – but parents are expected to insulate their children from many harms (at least those that we can purchase solutions for).

Personally, I am always wrestling with safety. I live in a body that is proof that bodies are fragile. For disabled parents in wheelchairs or on crutches, leaving the house brings risk. We cannot, despite our deepest desires, run after our kids. We cannot lift a car in a feat of superhuman strength. We cannot dive into the ocean to snatch our grade-schooler from a riptide. But we want to have big lives.

Accessibility is, simply, adjusting the environment to allow disabled people to participate. The belief that it’s worse to be disabled – which dictates a great deal of public and private life – thrives in part because disability is a reminder that bodies and minds fail, always. We build entire structures and belief systems around avoiding the reality of our collective fragility. Our governing ethos is that of independence and strength, not of need. When we request an accommodation – a lighter car seat, a ramp, a Braille edition of a book – we are admitting that we are needy. And when we have needs, we confess to something we wish weren’t true, that we are mortal.

What makes this manic rejection of our mortality even more fraught is that, once we become parents, we must also find a way to delude ourselves that our kids are indestructible. It is intolerable to think about the reality that our kids will be hurt, physically and emotionally. We buy into the myth of safety, as we attempt to create a force field of invincibility around our family so that we can stay safe and happy forever.

Instead of worrying about safety when we see a baby riding on their parent’s wheelchair, we should consider how we can create more spaces where wheelchair users are welcome. The picture disabled parents paint while in public with our kids is beautiful and offers permission. We are showing that there are countless ways to have bodies and minds and that it’s OK to cross the border of what’s expected. We are not reminders of death – we are reminders of how full life can be.

The best day ever: have scientists found the secret of happiness?,"Name: The perfect day.

Appearance: Data driven.

The perfect day? Huh. Good luck with that. You seem down – is your day going badly?

Honestly, it’s a mixed bag. The world is sliding into geopolitical chaos and climate collapse while Jeff Bezos sends Katy Perry into space, but on the plus side, I’ve just made a great sandwich. Would you like to know how to make it better?

My sandwich? Impossible. No, your day.

Let me guess. Is it generational wealth? No, there’s a new formula for how to have a good day.

A formula – what is this, GCSE chemistry? It’s social science, actually. Researchers at the University of British Columbia have used machine-learning techniques to analyse data from the American Time Use Survey and work out how the amount of time people devoted to various activities determined whether they rated their day as “better than typical”.

I see. So what’s the formula? Well, there’s six hours of family time and two hours with friends, plus an hour and a half of extra socialising, for a start.

Exhausting. Do introverts not contribute to the American Time Use Survey? Some of them seem to: one of the findings was that, while socialising was an important part of a better than average day, there was little benefit beyond two hours of it.

That makes sense – there’s a limit to how long I want to spend talking with Dave next door about the bins. “Some activities may be best in small doses, like a touch of salt when baking cookies,” the research team theorised. “While other activities may be akin to chocolate chips, where more is almost always better.”

Very true. What else should I be doing? Well, speaking of chocolate chips, there’s an hour of eating and drinking in there.

Easy. Anything else? Two hours of exercise.

Twice as much time exercising as eating and drinking? Madness. Data doesn’t lie. Better than average days involved work, too, though not more than six hours of it.

Yes, six hours of work is plenty. I need time for zoning out watching TikToks of medieval dog names and murderous emus. Sorry, no – you should only be having an hour of screen time.

So how am I supposed to relax? Well, here’s the strangest finding from this research: “Time spent relaxing was always negatively associated with having a good day.”

What? Strange, isn’t it? The research team think it’s because most of that time is spent watching TV.

In the age of prestige streaming? Unlikely. It’s probably because these days, we need lives stuffed with work, exercise and other people to distract ourselves from impending doom. Sssh, eat your sandwich.

Do say: “Such a perfect day, drink sangria in the park.”

Don’t say: “For a period not exceeding one hour, followed by a two-hour high-intensity interval training workout.”",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/apr/15/the-best-day-ever-have-scientists-found-the-secret-of-happiness,1
‘I want to tell the world’: Bergen-Belsen survivor recounts horrors of Holocaust,"For a long time, Lola Hassid Angel did not want to talk about the horrors of her childhood. Her experiences of the second world war had not been light: by the age of eight, the Holocaust survivor had “reached adulthood”, seen things she should never have seen, heard sounds she should never have heard, and been confronted by terrors she could neither forgive nor forget.

Which is why the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Bergen-Belsen by British forces on 15 April 1945 is as much a cause for joy as for the horror to come flooding back.

“But it’s also different,” Angel, now 88 and a great-great-grandmother, admitted over tea in her apartment in Athens. “Now I want to tell the whole world what happened. And that’s because I want all these men who lead us to know what war really looks like. The Germans had a zeal for death; they had turned it into a science.”

Quick to smile, gravel-voiced and diminutive, Angel is among the very last of Greece’s dwindling Jewish community to have survived Bergen-Belsen, a concentration camp complex in northern Germany. Its victims included Anne Frank, the teenage diarist who would become one of the most famous casualties of the Holocaust.

“What happened there was an abomination,” Angel said. “An abomination that historians will one day refer to as a dark page but which we, as the last survivors, are duty-bound to describe.”

Retreating Nazi forces agreed to hand the camp over to the allies on 12 April. It was, by all accounts, a peaceful exchange until the 11th Armoured division of the British army, backed by the 63rd Anti-tank regiment, arrived at the complex’s barbed wire confines on 15 April.

Witnesses said nothing could have prepared them for what they found. The stench of death was everywhere, in the corpses piled high, some green, almost all emaciated, lying by the thousands around the camp in various stages of decomposition. Typhus had spread. So, too, had dysentery and starvation. Of the 60,000 people locked inside, more than 14,000 would die within weeks of liberation because freedom had simply come too late. More than 70,000 people were killed on its grounds, most Jewish but also including 20,000 Soviet prisoners of war and other Nazi targets such as Roma and gay men.

“In Auschwitz it was the gas chambers, in Bergen-Belsen it was death through hunger and disease,” said Angel, who can vividly recall the arrival from Auschwitz in October 1944 of thousands of “exhausted and skeletal” female inmates, including Frank and her older sister, Margot. “The Germans were losing the war. They felt they were running out of time and they knew that in Bergen-Belsen, where typhus was so rife, they’d die very soon.”

The Angels were among the last Jews to be forcibly evacuated by the Nazis from Athens in April 1944, three years after the Wehrmacht had raised the swastika over the Acropolis and barely six months before the occupation would end.

View image in fullscreen Lola and her parents on the terrace of the Athens apartment where they were later arrested.

Like others who had sought refuge in the Greek capital, Lola’s parents, both Spanish passport holders, had fled south from Thessaloniki, home of one of Europe’s oldest Sephardic Jewish diasporas, when it became clear the Third Reich had the Ladino-speaking community in its sights.

With false identification papers and the courageous support of the resident Spanish consul – credited with delaying the deportation of hundreds of Sephardic Jews – the family had avoided detection until two members of the Gestapo and a Greek collaborator knocked at the door of their small rented apartment on 25 March 1944. It was Greek Independence Day.

“They appeared at dawn and dragged my father away but not before he had phoned Sebastián and Elena de Romero Radigales [the Spanish consul and his wife] who were family friends,” she recalled. “As ‘foreign Jews’ it was said my parents could be exchanged with German prisoners of war but Elena was very concerned and desperately appealed to my mother to adopt me.”

The wagons of the windowless locomotive that the Angels were forced to board served both as a passenger train to Bergen-Belsen and a death convoy for those in the rear carriages who, after a stopover in Vienna, continued on to Auschwitz.

Lola had not yet turned seven when she made the voyage. Time has not dulled her memory of the eight-day journey or of the train’s panic-stricken human cargo; “every so often” she still feels the lump in her throat that very soon came to symbolise fear. By the time the family arrived in the camp, the SS officers who had taken control had mastered the art of mass murder that underpinned the racial restructuring of the “final solution” envisaged by the Nazi regime.

In March 1945 alone, weeks before the camp’s liberation, more than 18,000 detainees died in conditions so horrific that British relief teams felt fit to say it was difficult to discern the living from the dead.

For the Angels, as so many others, there was no prisoner swap once D-day occurred. “At first they gave us Swedish Red Cross parcels and treated us reasonably well,” said the octogenarian. “But after 6 June 1944 the boxes stopped and we were given one piece of bread a day with diluted milk in the morning and a soup of water with potato peel at night. I didn’t wash in over a year. I was full of lice.”

As German defeat approached and the allies homed in, forces at the camp decided to put the estimated 2,500 “foreign Jews” initially lined up for exchange on a death train headed north. Lola and her parents were among them. The train was intercepted by rapidly advancing US Ninth Army troops on Friday 13 April.

“Suddenly it stopped near the lake of Magdeburg and the German guards left, leaving the train doors open. Hours later there were these Americans liberating us. I honestly believe I had two lucky stars: Sebastián and Elena who stopped us being deported earlier, and those Americans. If we had been kept in Bergen-Belsen, as was the case with my mother-in-law, it would have been the British rescuing us, without whom, of course, the war would never have been won.”

A day later US troops, commandeering the homes of villagers in the area, ensured the Angels and fellow detainees had a place to wash, sleep and eat. “An American soldier stood outside while our host, a Nazi marine commander, was forced to open up his house to us. For the first time we slept in a smooth bed with eiderdowns and were able to take a bath,” she smiled. “I’ll never forget my mother spotting a small dagger on a table, picking it up and saying: ‘Those who are victorious can take the weapons of the vanquished.’ I’m proud of that dagger and still have it even now.”

These days, most of Angel’s memories are “of the good things” that followed liberation. “The fear, the terror, takes over when I’m asleep. It appears out of nowhere in my subconscious, which is why I can never forget.”

In recent years, Angel has made a point of visiting Greek schools to address the Holocaust. The fresh-faced pupils listen in disbelief when she tells them that about 1.5 million children younger than 13 died in gas chambers during the war.

“At the end of each talk it’s always the same,” she said. “My legs shake, my head spins, knowing what really happened not so very long ago. The Nazis finessed the art of killing people, down to how much Zyklon B gas was needed to kill hundreds at the same time. Technology has progressed so much since then. My big fear is if another Hitler comes along, the next war will be much worse.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/15/bergen-belsen-survivor-lola-hassid-angel-recounts-horrors-of-holocaust,1
The Glassworker: Studio Ghibli’s legacy lives in Pakistan’s first hand-drawn feature,"The Glassworker began as an “impossible dream” and, like every impossible dream, its existence is a testament to the grit and grind of those who willed it to life. They are the artists at Mano Animation Studios, whose co-founder Usman Riaz is the director, animator and co-composer behind Pakistan’s first hand-drawn animated feature.

The titular glassworker is Vincent Oliver, voiced by Teresa Gallagher as a child and Sacha Dhawan as an adult. With his father, Tomas (Art Malik), he works at the finest glass workshop in Waterfront town. But as war breaks out over the sovereignty of the Great Ravine, their treasured storefront comes under threat. Amid it all a budding romance sparks between Vincent and Alliz Amano (Anjli Mohindra), a talented violinist who turns out to be the daughter of the colonel who has turned their quaint town into a warfront.

Most of the story unfolds in the form of childhood memories, as Vincent and Alliz grow up under the looming threat of war and try to hold on to their friendship, art and innocence, all of which are impacted by their fathers’ beliefs.

Every hand-drawn frame is handled with the utmost care, much like Vincent and Tomas handling the molten glass. In an early sequence, we see the glass-making process in detail as young Vincent empties his lungs into the blowpipe to form a sculpture’s final shape; breathing life into it, in a sense. This metaphor is the core of The Glassworker: just like the glass sculpture, beautiful things take a lot of effort to form – but can shatter at just a slight touch. Later in the film, the glass sculpture breaks, foreshadowing the corruption that befalls the glassworks as Alliz’s father, Colonel Amano (Tony Jayawardena), coerces Tomas into helping build the army’s warships.

Much like Tomas, Amano is a disciplinarian. His battle planes cast ghastly shadows over the lush green fields where Vincent and Alliz play, souring their blossoming companionship. As the story progresses, quiet and subtle moments reveal Amano’s tragedy. Like Vincent and Tomas, he, too, has an appreciation for the arts. He loves Alliz’s music and, more importantly, he loves her. But war drives him away from his daughter and his sensibilities. We see him at home in a red armchair, broken and tired, underneath a family portrait in which his father, a decorated general, is sitting in the same chair. Father and son are, in their own ways, also victims of the ruthless cycle of war.

The Glassworker’s anti-war sentiment and its hand-drawn animation call to mind the works of Studio Ghibli’s Hayao Miyazaki. The film’s aesthetics possess the same emotional resonance and attention to detail that are part of Miyazaki’s distinctive style. Even the romantic score is reminiscent of Joe Hisaishi’s iconic compositions for Ghibli films. But while The Glassworker’s exploration of the hereditary nature of ideals is compelling the film’s anti-war philosophy and presentation lack the nuance that is a staple of Miyazaki’s works.

Still, Riaz’s debut feature is not without glimmers of brilliance. Aside from being a landmark in the history of Pakistani cinema, what sets The Glassworker apart from its inspirations is the rich and vibrant world of Waterfront, partly influenced by Riaz’s hometown of Karachi. Although it is difficult to tell if the moral values The Glassworker tries to impart will be remembered, few will forget the bustling market Tomas and Vincent walk through, where the little glassworker is treated to one of the mouth-watering gulab jamuns that sparkle in a pot.",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/apr/16/the-glassworker-studio-ghibli-movie-sbs-on-demand-pakistan,1
‘The grief takes your breath away’: how death transformed a loving family – and shaped a remarkable film,"Peace hangs over a farm in rural Norway. The last of the melting snow lingers in hummocks and bikes are strewn outside the Payne family’s small rented cottage. Nik Payne materialises from behind the barn where he has been feeding the cows. One of his three children, Falk, 12, is lying on the sofa with a fever and a Biggles novel; later, Freja, 15, and Ulv, nine (known as Wolf or Wolfie), return from school. Their home is as warm and chaotic as any family’s – boots and coats strewn in the hallway, a fridge covered in photos, shelves of books – but with a few differences: there is no television and behind the living room door is an unobtrusive, very personal shrine.

The Paynes find themselves the reluctant stars of a film, A New Kind of Wilderness, which has won awards at Sundance and other festivals around the world. This documentary begins, deceptively, as Variety put it, “like Swiss Family Robinson updated for the era of Instagram cottagecore”. The children, with their older half-sister Ronja, are being raised by Nik, an Englishman, and his Norwegian wife Maria to be “wild and free”: home-schooled, creative, growing their own food, living closely and gently with nature.

Then tragedy strikes. In 2019, Maria falls ill with cancer and dies, aged 41. With sensitivity and intimacy, film-maker Silje Evensmo Jacobsen follows what happens next as the grief-stricken Nik tries to stay true to the beliefs and daily patterns of living he created with Maria, home schooling his bereft children and trying to protect his family. I defy anyone to watch it dry-eyed.

Now the Paynes are travelling the world, attending Q&As at film festivals where the documentary has been rapturously received. At their first festival, they all watched the film again with the audience. “That was a mistake, because it still affects us in many ways and we’re fighting back the tears,” says Nik. “Now we sometimes go in for the last 10 minutes.” Is it traumatic to relive their tragedy? “I see it as good, a cathartic process, bringing it up again,” he says. “Grief is an ongoing thing. Grief changes you for ever. It’s part of you for ever but it’s not the defining part.”

The film is so intensely moving perhaps because the people at its heart are not showy or spectacular. Nik, who makes yoghurt and bakes bread as we chat in his kitchen, is a private, deep-thinking man who radiates self-sufficiency. Watching him grieve on film is agonising.

“At the start, the grief takes your breath away. You’re left gasping for the next breath. The only thing you can do is just breathe. It’s the contemplation of having to endure things for a long time that becomes unbearable, not the thing itself,” he says. “It was so important for me that I had the kids. You haven’t any choice but to get up. It’s impossible to be miserable all the time because they come up with spontaneous joy. They are in their grief in a different way, for shorter periods. They don’t sit in it, like we do.”

He and Maria met through a mutual friend when Nik, who had grown up on a dairy farm near Chester, worked as a flying instructor in Portugal. “We really hit it off,” he says. Soon after, he visited her in Norway. “Within six weeks, I’d moved over.” Maria’s daughter from an earlier relationship, Ronja, was four at the time, and the three of them chose to live in the countryside; 364 days after Nik moved to Norway, Freja was born. They bought a smallholding and Maria taught photography and film-making, and then started a blog about their life. “I was the one who did the farm and grew the food,” says Nik.

Jacobsen saw Maria’s blog and in 2014 made a pilot film about the family living close to nature. No broadcasters picked it up, but when Jacobsen got back in touch after Maria’s death, Nik decided to let her into the family’s shattered life because Maria would have wanted it. “For me, it was a completely unnatural thing. Maria was more extroverted, more into film-making, and had wanted to start this project,” he says. “In her blog, she shared everything about our lives – the good stuff but also the hard stuff, including her own illness. She was very honest, so I decided to go for it as a kind of legacy for her. Maybe it will help someone out there.”

What emerges is a series of dilemmas as harsh reality challenges Nik’s pure ideals, particularly his quest for self-sufficiency and a creative education for his children. In the absence of Maria, he tries so hard to provide everything for them: he grows food, cooks, brushes Wolfie’s long blond hair and teaches them at home even when he knows his Norwegian is not quite up to scratch. But he must also earn a living. Did he reach a point where he was overwhelmed by trying to do it all? “Probably every day, and then I had to start again the next day. That’s why I had to send them to school.”

This is a climactic moment in the film. Did sending them to school feel like a defeat? Or doing the right thing? “It’s a continuous feeling of defeat or disappointment. They really did enjoy the home schooling and they would have liked to continue. I had hoped that I could give them that, but I couldn’t see a way to do it.”

Despite their initial fears, the children settle into mainstream education, although this forces another uncomfortable confrontation with reality when Freja brings home a school iPad (all Norwegian children are issued them). Many tech-sceptic parents will recognise the grimace on Nik’s face when his children huddle round the iPad in rapture as Freja plays a game.

It’s heartbreaking how alone Nik appears at this time. He had some counselling while Maria was dying but it was halted rather abruptly and, as stubbornly self-reliant as ever, Nik vowed to become his own therapist. “Maria always talked about ‘doing the inner work’. For years, I didn’t know what she was talking about, but I started to, slowly but surely.” What about friends? Talking wouldn’t have helped, he says. “I was just alone. It’s the loneliness of the last speaker of a dead language. That’s how I felt.”

It was sometimes comforting having the film-maker in their home. “Silje was very good – she came and hung out with us without filming and became a friend I could talk to off camera,” he says. But Nik worried about exposing the children. “She wanted to film how Freja was feeling, and I had to put my foot down and say, ‘I don’t want you to do any more now.’ There’s a scene where Freja has read a letter from Ronja and I came in because I just wanted to check Freja was all right. Often I’d be hiding outside the bedroom if she was being talked to by Silje, just to …” He tails off. “We all enjoyed having Silje around most of the time, but there were definitely times when it was, ‘Ohhhft, I could do without that.’”

Being filmed selling their dream farm was one of those moments. Nik’s labouring and tree surgery couldn’t pay their mortgage. All this pain is leavened by beauty and humour, much of the latter provided by Wolf. When Falk mourns their farm for having everything, Wolfie chips in: “But not pet whales.”

While Freja and Falk are cautious and thoughtful, like their dad, Wolfie is a bundle of energy, arriving home from school on his bike like a whirlwind before performing multiple somersaults on the trampoline.

“You need some comedic relief in a movie like that, I think,” says Freja of her little brother, who has, according to Nik, “been eating his weight in pancakes and jam” at festival hotel buffets. “The fun part [of the festivals] is when they call up your name if you’ve won something,” says Wolfie, who points to a gold starfish-shaped gong from Egypt and another award from Hungary on their windowsill. The film has been shown on Norwegian television and is now being released in Japan, where their chic Nordic knitwear (all knitted by Granny – Maria’s mother) has proved particularly popular.

For much of the two years Silje filmed the family, Nik assumed that if the project was ever finished it would play at some obscure eastern European film festival “watched by three people, one of whom is asleep”. He first saw it at home by himself and “blubbed all the way through. It was difficult to be objective, to see what sort of film it really is, but I was happy there wasn’t anything in there I couldn’t stand behind.” He had no clue it would be so well received until Sundance, when the audience whooped and whistled, giving a standing ovation when they realised the family were in the auditorium.

At home, the Sundance world cinema grand jury prize is placed in the shrine beside Maria’s photograph, plus two peacock feathers and other precious objects they remember her by. Maria would be so delighted by the award, thinks Nik. “She studied film and some of the guys that she studied with have said she dreamed of winning something at Sundance.”

They still remember Maria at dinner. “We light a candle before each meal and hold hands. We’re not religious as such but we give thanks for the food, the day we’ve had and each other, and we send love up to Maria,” says Nik.

The Paynes are perhaps closer than many families – with more chat at mealtimes – but they don’t want to be defined by their grief. Freja is happy at school; Nik rolls his eyes about her smartphone-time but she also raises and sells chickens for pocket money. Nik hopes to home-school Falk and Wolf again for a year before they start secondary. He is also writing a book about his experiences and aiming to buy a modest smallholding to pursue farming and self-sufficiency. The film may be successful but documentaries don’t tend to make much money; Nik says he hasn’t received any revenue from it. “I’m fortunate enough not to be a money-oriented person. I would actually feel uncomfortable if I was making money out of that. I like the fact that it’s something I can give.”

In the film, Nik shrugs off his dad’s suggestion that he find a new partner, but now says he enjoyed a brief relationship last year – “It was good to realise that I’m still alive” – before realising they had different visions for their lives. Does he feel lonely? He pauses for a longer-than-usual thought. “Sometimes, maybe. I’m somebody who is naturally good with his own company. I read a lot, I think a lot, there are plenty of people around I can talk to, if I want to. Sometimes, at dinner time when the kids are bickering or talking about fart humour, I think, oh God, I wish there was an adult to talk to.”

The children aren’t having that.

“No!” says Wolf. “He wants to talk about farts. We don’t.”

“It’s like being at a chimpanzee’s tea party with him,” says Freja, and the sunny Norwegian spring day is brightened by their laughter.",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/apr/15/a-new-kind-of-wilderness-film-nik-payne-norway-interview,1
What’s more vacuous than an endless vacuum? It’s Lauren Sánchez and Katy Perry’s party in space | Marina Hyde,"Well, I watched every second of the buildup, flight and aftermath of the first Blue Origin all-female space trip. You’ve heard of one small step for man? This was one giant leap backwards for womankind. I’m kidding, I’m kidding! What could be more empowering or something than watching Lauren Sánchez make going to space sound like brunch with the girrrrrls. Sally Ride could never.

Anyway, if you missed this, Jeff Bezos’s fiancee took an 11-minute trip to the edge of space on one of his Blue Origin craft on Monday, alongside some all-female passengers – sorry, “crew” – who included CBS anchor Gayle King and pop star Katy Perry. So yes: the Woman’s World video is no longer the most plastic feminist thing Katy’s done.

Given the mixture of freebie rides and seats sold to the super-rich, the thing people always say about Blue Origin tickets is that prices range from zero to $28m dollars. A bit like a seat on a RyanAir flight to Tallinn. But these spots were all personally gifted by Bezos and Sánchez because this was an Important Mission. Which also meant the whole thing was exclusively documented by Blue Origin’s Pravda-like web channel. Here, the anchors and reporters kept explaining that – unlike when men went to space in the past – this mission was all about emotions. But look, it’s great that we’re valorising emotions above all things, because it gives me permission to say how very much I hated this entire, hilariously vacuous spectacle.

Lauren already bills herself as a children’s author, helicopter pilot, journalist and philanthropist, and kept being told she was adding “astronaut” to the world’s longest multi-hyphenate. How did she find the trip? “I don’t really have the words for this, like … ?” OK but can you at least try? “I can’t put it into words but I looked out the window and we got to see the moon.”

Back at the viewing platform in the West Texas desert, commentary was provided by, among others, Kris Jenner and a bottom-tier Kardashian (Khloé). Khloé glossed the moment of landing with the words: “it’s literally so hard to explain right now”. Other insights? “There’s one woman whose grandfather is back there and he is 92 and they didn’t even have transportation back then.” I mean, the guy was literally pre-horse. Historic scenes.

Amid extremely stiff competition, the most hardcore gibberish emanated from Perry, who served up an entire word salad bar involving the “feminine divine” and being “super-connected to love”. “It’s about making space for future woman,” she explained. “It’s about taking up space.” Imagine going to actual space and talking instead about therapy-speak “space”. When Buzz Aldrin beheld the surface of the moon, he described it as “magnificent desolation”. Honestly, if he wanted to feel desolation he could have just tuned into this corner of West Texas on Monday afternoon. When a Stem advocate came for her post-flight interview, we got to see the apparently lobotomised reporter shriek: “How do you look perfect after just going to space?!”

In truth, how the women looked had been an overwhelming part of the buildup, and by their own design. In an Elle magazine joint interview with the passengers, Lauren showed off the hot space suits she’d personally commissioned, inquiring rhetorically: “Who would not get glam before the flight?” “Space is going to finally be glam,” agreed Perry. “Let me tell you something. If I could take glam up with me, I would do that. We are going to put the ‘ass’ in astronaut.” A former Nasa rocket scientist said: “I also wanted to test out my hair and make sure that it was OK. So I skydived in Dubai with similar hair to make sure I would be good – took it for a dry run.” Still want more? Because there was SO much of it. “We’re going to have lash extensions flying in the capsule!” explained Lauren. “I think it’s so important for people to see us like that,” explained a civil rights activist. “This dichotomy of engineer and scientist, and then beauty and fashion. We contain multitudes. Women are multitudes. I’m going to be wearing lipstick.”

Ooof. I always thought space travel was futuristic, but this was the first time it came off as travelling back in time, in this case using their little capsule to take us back to the most ludicrous inanities of 2010s girlboss feminism.

Ultimately, it felt like a sign of the times that everything was about personal growth rather than affording any new understanding of wider humanity. As King put it: “I’m so proud of me right now.” Everyone, bar none, talked in whatever trite solipsism language has been reduced to by a permanent diet of social media self-care. It all made me realise how much I miss humans not permanently crying on TV, and being able to find words that don’t sound like they could be printed above a picture of a crossroads sign on Instagram, or maybe some sandy footprints on a beach.

Having oh-my-godded her way through some pure gibberish, Lauren eventually announced that she’d learned: “We’re all in this together. We’re so connected.” Agreed. In which spirit, please please please could Amazon pay full and fair tax in all the territories in which it, one of the world’s biggest companies, operates? Such an act of connection truly would be your and Jeff’s gift to our planet that you apparently just got some kind of a perspective on while Katy Perry was floating around during the zero-gravity bit pushing towards the camera a butterfly printed with her next tour dates. Why do I feel like the most meaningful thing to come out of this will be a three-minute song called Space Cowgirl? Forget the right stuff. This was the wrong stuff.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/15/lauren-sanchez-katy-perry-space-blue-origin-female-flight,1
Why was I deported from Hong Kong? There should be no more ministerial visits until the UK gets an explanation | Wera Hobhouse,"Last week, my husband and I flew to Hong Kong with real excitement to see my family and meet our newborn grandson for the first time. Welcoming a family member is a precious moment and this was going to be a special trip. But what would have become an incredible memory – seeing our grandson for the first time – was snatched from us before we reached the baggage carousel.

Arriving at passport control, all seemed well. I handed my passport to a polite immigration official who put it into the computer system, and then paused. At this point I realised that something had been flagged up.

After being led off to a room for questioning, I was interviewed and my luggage was thoroughly searched. After three hours I was simply told that I was denied entry, and was bundled on to the next flight back to London. My passport was only returned after I landed in the UK and left the plane.

Throughout all this, I felt two overriding emotions: anguish, at not being able to see my family and meet my grandson; and confusion. At no point was I told why I was being deported. Without a satisfactory answer from the Chinese government – which has simply affirmed that “the Hong Kong SAR [special administrative region] government has the authority to handle individual cases of entry” – I must draw my own conclusions. The most alarming is that I was denied entry because of my role as a British parliamentarian, and one who has levelled criticism at Beijing for its human rights abuses.

I don’t shy away from championing democracy and civil liberty. They are values that I hold dear, and which have shaped my life. I will never forget dancing with friends on the Berlin Wall as it – together with the dictatorship that built it – crumbled. They are values, though, that are under increasing threat. The optimism of the 1990s has been replaced by a belated recognition: that we must renew and protect our values in the face of a new, rising tide of authoritarianism.

Last Thursday I saw a sliver of that newly emboldened authoritarianism. It is opaque and impenetrable, and it does not offer explanations. Its tools are intimidation and obfuscation. The implications for the UK are stark. We need to be clear-eyed about the threats posed by the Chinese government – and we must take action to mitigate these threats.

Ministers should not simply accept this lack of transparency as the cost of doing business. We must be direct: if you will not be straight and don’t answer legitimate questions we cannot engage with you on the basis of mutual trust. That’s why, until we get a clear answer on why I was deported, no government minister should be visiting China on official business.

We must also address the risks posed to us at home. This should begin with the government taking immediate steps to prevent the further expansion of China’s security apparatus in the UK by, once and for all, blocking proposals for a new Chinese “super embassy”. It seems obvious that a base for potential “spy dungeons” should not be built on the site of the former Royal Mint, on the City’s doorstep – but this government has inexplicably refused to rule it out.

The crisis over the Scunthorpe steelworks should also raise fresh concerns about the role of Chinese interests in our national infrastructure. The decision by British Steel’s owners, Jingye, to turn down the government’s £500m offer to support the plant’s future precipitated the near collapse of the UK’s virgin steel production last week. We cannot find ourselves in a similar position again: scrambling to save a vital domestic industry that has been left to struggle by corporations based in foreign countries which do not share our interests or ideals.

This adds urgency to Liberal Democrat proposals for an audit of UK-based assets owned by companies or officials from countries listed as Foreign Office human rights priorities, including China. The government should include a commitment to this in its own UK-China audit – the publication of which, originally expected early this year, should now be completed urgently as we face new geopolitical uncertainties.

Our response to the Trump administration’s unreliability mustn’t be to throw ourselves into the arms of authoritarian states like China. We must continue to stand up for our values and interests. If the government refuses to stand tall now, when will it?",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/15/deported-hong-kong-no-more-uk-ministerial-visits-explanation,1
"Don’t worry, gen Z! A billionaire boomer says your lives are going to be great | Arwa Mahdawi","Chin up, everyone. Things may seem grim at the moment but a billionaire has swooped in to reassure everyone – particularly impecunious young people – that everything is going to be OK. Better than OK, in fact. According to JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, despite the current economic and political instability, gen Z should be grateful for what will be a very bright and AI-enhanced future.

“These kids, anyone who’s depressed – as long as we don’t have nuclear war – they’re going to have an unbelievable life,” Dimon said in a recent interview with Fox News. “People say the next generation’s in bad shape,” he added. “Really? They’re going to inherit a country that’s worth two [or] three hundred trillion dollars. They’re probably going to live to 120; AI is going to cure some cancers … They shouldn’t be bemoaning their situation.”

I am not a gen Z kid by any means – I am a geriatric millennial with creaky knees – but I’m definitely depressed about the state of the world. And I’m sorry, Mr Dimon, but I’m not going to stop my moaning. To be clear, I’m not trying to say I know better than the “King of Wall Street”. I am a humble freelance journalist, not a titan of industry. I don’t know how to run an enormous financial institution that rakes in huge profits during the good times and gets bailed out by taxpayers during the bad times. I would never presume to know more about economics than the CEO of the biggest bank in the world.

But there are a few things that I do know that Dimon, for all his infinite wisdom, doesn’t seem to have fully grasped. When you are a billionaire with a collection of palatial homes, someone who crisscrosses the world in private jets fraternising with other members of the 1%, you can quickly become a teeny bit out of touch. Insulated from normal-people problems by your bags of money, you can lose sight of some very basic issues. And that means when you go on Fox News and tell everyone how great everything is, you can sound like a bit of a pillock.

Since Dimon seems to have a hard time understanding why so many people are struggling to cope – and why gen Z reports the poorest mental health of any generation – let me spell out a few things that should be pretty obvious. The first being that the US, along with the rest of the world, has a housing crisis. Houses in the US are now 47% more expensive than they were in 2020; wages, meanwhile, are fairly stagnant. Recent graduates tend to have mountains of student debt and are entering a pretty dismal job market. Food prices have gone through the roof. In short: not great!

Some of these recent graduates will struggle for a bit and then inherit assets from their parents and be fine. This is the so-called Great Wealth Transfer that Dimon was alluding to when he was talking about gen Z inheriting trillions. But not everyone has rich parents who are going to leave them a bunch of cash. Indeed, according to one analysis, the top 1.5% in the US will account for 42% of wealth transfers through 2045. The Great Wealth Transfer will simply exacerbate inequality. Dimon is right that some gen Zers will lead unbelievable lives of unparalleled luxury: they’ll go on rides around space, have access to cutting-edge medicine, and may well live until they’re 120. They’ll reap all the benefits of technological advances. But the “they” that Dimon keeps referring to are going to be a privileged few. AI will be utilised to save some people’s lives and – this is already happening – be harnessed by military contractors to shorten other people’s.

I think what people like Dimon really can’t understand – what his unconscionable layers of wealth insulate him from – is how precarious the modern world feels to so many of us. I live a comfortable life. I own a house in the US. I am far more privileged than most Americans. Yet it feels as if everything is crumbling around me; that every single facet of life is getting worse. On a local level, my library and public transit system are being hit with devastating budget cuts. More broadly, people are being threatened with deportation for airing their political views. Meanwhile, the climate crisis seems to be creeping ever closer. You think I care about living to 120? Like many people, I’m just trying to get through the next 24 hours.

The Blue Origin flight showcased the utter defeat of American feminism | Moira Donegan,"There are some spectacles of US decadence and decline that almost seem too on the nose – the sort of orgies of vulgar provocation or fantastic lack of self-awareness that exceed the limits of parody, so that if they were in a novel, you’d think the writer was laying it on a little thick. Among these is the all-female flight by Blue Origin, the Jeff Bezos-owned rocket tourism company, which on Monday launched a phallically shaped pod full of women – including the pop star Katy Perry and Bezos’s partner, Lauren Sánchez – on a brief trip into space.

The flight, which was promoted for months in advance, was touted as a triumph of feminism, a win for science and an embrace of the kind of expansive, curious human spirit of striving and possibility that once animated both. Instead, the flight served as a kind of perverse funeral for the America that once enabled both scientific advancement and feminist progress – a spectacle that mocked these aspirations by appropriating them for such an indulgent and morally hollow purpose.

Blue Origin itself is a product of state abandonment of space exploration. Founded in 2000 to fill the void left by the federal government’s effort to privatize the work of agencies like Nasa, Blue Origin has long been a pet project of Bezos, who was almost the sole funder of the company in its early years. Focused on tourism, rather than scientific inquiry, the company is best known for its slow technological development in comparison with its main competitor, SpaceX (another space tourism vehicle, launched by the Trump adviser and mega-donor Elon Musk); for the giggle-inducing obscene look of its rockets; and for its periodic publicity stunt flights featuring celebrities (William Shatner has also taken the ride). Bezos’s Amazon donated $1m to Trump’s most recent inauguration, and he intervened during the 2024 election to stop the Washington Post, the newspaper he owns, from endorsing Kamala Harris; the Trump administration, for its part, just awarded Blue Origin a contract worth more than $2bn.

Once, Nasa was the pride of the American experiment: a testament to how a society dedicated to legal equality and passionate hard work could expand the horizons of human possibility. Now, Blue Origin is a testament to the corruption and circumscribed possibilities of the profit motive run amok. Space used to be a frontier for human exploration, a fount of innovation, and a symbol of a bright, uncertain and expansive future. Now, it is a backdrop for the Instagram selfies of the rich and narcissistic. The Blue Origin flight does not make me feel like humanity will reach new heights of achievement. It makes me feel like everything that is coming is grimly predictable, tailored to the impulses of the richest, least responsible and least morally intelligent people on Earth.

But the flight, and its grim promotional cycle, might be most depressing for what it reveals about the utter defeat of American feminism. Sánchez, the organizer of the flight, has touted the all-female crew as a win for women. But she herself is a woman in a deeply antifeminist model. It is not her rocket company that took her and her friends to the edge of space; it’s her male fiance’s. And it is no virtue of her character that put her inside the rocket – not her capacity, not her intellect and not her hard work – but merely her relationship with a man. (The fact that the rocket itself looks so phallic does not help to lessen the flight’s message that the surest way for women to raise themselves in the world is to attach themselves to a man.)

There are at least two women on the mission who can be credited as serious persons: Aisha Bowe, an aerospace engineer, and Amanda Nguyen, a civil rights entrepreneur whose past work with Nasa makes her something closer to an actual astronaut. But most of the crew’s self-presentation and promotion of the flight has leaned heavily on a vision of women’s empowerment that is light on substance and heavy on a childlike, girlish silliness that insults women by cavalierly linking their gender with superficiality, vanity and unseriousness.

In an interview with Elle, the crew members paid lip service to the importance of women, and particularly women of color, in Stem. (The Trump administration has forced Nasa to close some offices in order to comply with its ban on the diversity, equity and inclusion programs that would recruit such candidates.) But mostly, they seemed interested in talking about their makeup and hair. “Space is going to finally be glam,” Katy Perry said, bizarrely. “Let me tell you something. If I could take glam up with me, I would do that. We are going to put the ‘ass’ in astronaut.”

“Who would not get glam before the flight?!” asked Sánchez, who evidently can’t imagine that women might prioritize anything else. “We’re going to have lash extensions flying in the capsule.” Bowe, too, joined in, saying that she had gone to extreme lengths to make sure that she would be, of all things, well coiffed for the experience. “I skydived in Dubai with similar hair to make sure I would be good,” she said. “I took it for a dry run.”

It is not misogynist to say that these women do not have their priorities in order. Rather, it is misogynist of them to so forcefully associate womanhood with cosmetics and looks, rather than with any of the more noble and human aspirations to which space travel might acquaint them – curiosity, inquiry, discovery, exploration, a sense of their own mortality, an apprehension of the divine. These women, who have placed themselves as representatives for all women with their promotion of the flight – positioning themselves as aspirational models of femininity – have presented a profoundly antifeminist vision of what womankind’s future is: dependent on men, confined to triviality, and deeply, deeply silly.

Is this the future that awaits women in Donald Trump’s America: one where the only way to achievement is through sexual desirability, the only way to status as an ornamental attachment on a man who really counts, the only subject on which we are qualified to speak is whether lash extensions will stay in place? If this is the future, count me out. On the other hand, the notion of being launched off of such a grim and sexist Earth is looking more and more appealing.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/15/blue-origin-flight-american-feminism,1
The love that dare not speak its name: why I’m coming out as a gay man who loves Taylor Swift,"As a self-evidently gay man, I’ve generally been spared the awkwardness of coming out. That was, until I became a Swiftie. In recent years I have become adept at gauging the temperature of a room before revealing my predilection. Is this a safe space? Will I be sidelined or treated as a pervert because of who I choose to love? Should I lie, or just be evasive? I want to live authentically, but at what cost?

Taylor Swift is at once the closest thing we have to a monoculture and the most divisive pop star of modern times. As a self-identified Swiftie, I believe her gift lies in the ability to take hyper-specific experiences and render them universal. I’ve never performed a 149-date world tour while reeling from the heartbreak of having been ghosted by Matty Healy of the 1975, but listening to I Can Do It With a Broken Heart, her song about that indignity, has helped me put on a brave face when faced by life’s more quotidian challenges. By writing a 10-minute epic about her three-month fling with Jake Gyllenhaal, Taylor gives fans space to mourn our own failed situationships or private disappointments – however fleeting or insignificant they may appear to others.

When I come out as a Swiftie, I’m generally met by one of two reactions. It’s either “she saved my life” or “are you joking?” Gay men tend to lean towards the latter. This despite being a demographic typically enthralled by female pop stars, whether they’re “main pop girls” or had two “blink and you miss them” hits 15 years ago (Alexis Jordan, thank you for your service). I’ve tangled with what makes Taylor an exception to this rule. Gay culture thrives on camp and irony, whereas Taylor is aggressively earnest. Her music is designed less for the club and more for yearning over a boy you double-messaged in 2015 and never heard back from.

Typically, gay men like to be perceived as tastemakers, considering anything once cool to be tragic the second it hits the mainstream. We police celebrities with the same critical eye that we cast on ourselves (try having self-esteem when gay Twitter has you convinced that Chris Pratt has a “dad bod”). Taylor is unavoidably uncool: the consensus is that she is allergic to “serving” on a red carpet and has a charming dorkiness which no cavalry of stylists seems equipped to eradicate.

From Judy Garland to Britney Spears, gay men tend to idolise stars with tragic backstories, equating their struggles with our own, and finding strength in their strength. Taylor is the furthest thing from an underdog. While Mariah Carey says her sister attempted to pimp her when she was 12, Taylor was raised by bankers on a Christmas tree farm and given a gender-neutral name in order to succeed in corporate America (as she arguably has). Her own perceived sense of victimhood centres on tales of high school ostracism and being interrupted by Kanye West at an awards show in 2009 – an event that has been referenced on four of her subsequent albums, most recently last year. (OK, maybe there is something inherently camp about publicly nursing a 16-year grudge.)

Taylor Swift: You Need to Calm Down – video

Unlike Madonna or Lady Gaga, she hasn’t explicitly cultivated a gay audience. Her 2006 debut included the lyric: “So go and tell your friends that I’m obsessive and crazy / That’s fine, I’ll tell mine you’re gay.” That version was withdrawn, resulting in a much-memed eBay listing for a “Taylor Swift debut CD (homophobic version)”. In 2019, she was inspired to write the Lover single You Need to Calm Down after a friend pointed out that her position on gay rights was unclear. With lyrics such as “Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD?” – referencing the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation – the result was well-meaning but heavy-handed. She played New York City’s Stonewall Inn for a surprise Pride month performance, but her activism stalled soon after. In a relative absence of a consistent stance on the matter, some Swifties – or “gaylors” – have constructed elaborate conspiracy theories about a supposed secret relationship between Taylor and supermodel (and former BFF) Karlie Kloss (arguably two of the straightest women to have ever lived).

I wonder whether the resistance goes deeper. Gay culture encourages us to evolve, reinvent and leave the past behind: if society says you are unworthy for long enough, you start to believe it. The skinny bullied child transforms into a muscled Adonis, essentially becoming the boys we feared in high school. Taylor’s Eras tour embraced all her previous incarnations, however messy or cringe those teenage corkscrew curls and fairytale ballgowns were. Perhaps her refusal to erase her awkward history is confronting for her gay male fans to witness. What if we could all regard our past selves, however naive or clumsy, with tenderness instead of embarrassment?

I love being queer. But being in gay spaces can evoke complicated feelings. There’s joy at having found a sense of belonging that many of us were denied growing up, coupled with the insecurities that arise when a traumatised community starts to eat itself – imposing impossible standards about what counts as hot, aspirational or cool. For me, watching the Eras tour was a comparatively simple pleasure. Surrounded by demented Swifties as I honked along to We Are Never Getting Back Together, I was undeniably cringe. But for three hours, I was free.",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/apr/16/gay-man-who-loves-taylor-swift,1
"While Starmer’s hand was forced on British Steel, it’s time to forge ahead with more nationalisations | Owen Jones","British Steel is heading for nationalisation – against the will of the government. This is an important point, because it speaks to dogma colliding with practical reality. Here is a private company defeated by the “sink or swim” laws of the free market ideology that produced it, demanding instead that taxpayers come to its rescue – by threatening to make shortsighted business decisions with damaging consequences for the country’s future. What happened in Scunthorpe is not an outlier in the failed experiment of privatisation, and the government’s emergency takeover tells us that public ownership is a realistic solution if there is a political will.

Here’s another example: water. Even the City editor of the Financial Times – hardly a bastion of radical socialism – concluded that its privatisation looked like “little more than an organised rip-off”. Since privatisation in 1989, water companies have piled up more than £60bn in debt, while our water bills have continued to rise. Yet despite rivers and seas being blighted with raw sewage, and the loss of 1tn litres of water from leaky pipes in 2021 alone, shareholders raked in more than £85bn since this most basic of human necessities was flogged off.

On both British Steel and water, Nigel Farage outflanked Labour – from the left. That this Thatcherite former City trader demanded British Steel’s nationalisation as he posed with steelworkers, and called for Thames Water to go bust, is testament to how unpopular privatisation is. A poll last year found that 82% of Britons thought water should be publicly run – compared with 8% who believed in privatisation, which is half as many as those who think the moon landings were staged. Three-quarters believe rail and mail should be publicly run, with more than seven in 10 backing nationalised energy.

But as with the banks in 2008, nationalisation is treated as a reluctant emergency measure. Starmer backed nationalisation of the natural monopolies during his leadership campaign. Indeed, he told the BBC’s Andrew Neil in 2020 that nationalisation of those industries was a pledge that would appear in Labour’s next manifesto. But the following year, he told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg that he “never made a commitment to nationalisation”, itself testament to his pathological dishonesty. It’s true that Labour has committed to nationalising rail, but after the resignation of transport secretary, Louise Haigh – who genuinely believed in public ownership – what that will mean in practice is highly questionable, especially if an increasingly austerity-driven government starves it of investment.

Public ownership shouldn’t be a last resort. From the banks to the myriad private contractors feeding off state largesse – such as Serco, which was fined more than £19m after billing taxpayers for tagging prisoners who were dead – private ownership has repeatedly failed. What’s now missing is a positive vision of what public ownership could look like in the 21st century. A lot of the blame needs to be directed at Peter Mandelson’s grandfather – a chap named Herbert Morrison, who developed Labour’s form of nationalisation after the second world war. That model was top-down and undemocratic. Most of the board members of the newly nationalised industries were just brought over from their privately run predecessors. The first chair of the National Coal Board, for example, was a former coal baron named the 1st Viscount Hyndley. These industries were kept at arm’s length and run on a commercial basis.

In 1946, one Liberal politician had a point when he said that a miner who went to work in this newly nationalised industry “will see the same manager, the same deputy, the old roadway, the same coalface and, on Friday, he will probably be paid by the same man”. There was never any genuine public enthusiasm for privatisation, but this undemocratic system meant that Margaret Thatcher won passive acquiescence by arguing: “What earthly sense is it that families should have a millionth share in some nationalised industry which is indifferent to their needs and wishes?”

A democratic alternative is surely possible, where representatives of workers and consumers play a key role in running industries. In French cities such as Paris, for example, the water supply was privatised from the mid-1980s onwards, and prices soared. When it was taken back under public ownership, a board of directors was installed that included elected city councillors, trade union representatives and members of environmental non-government organisations. The Observatoire parisien de l’eau is an assembly representing civil society that oversees the board’s decisions. Not only have water bills fallen by 8% and leakage levels halved, but the city offers taps with sparkling water.

Rather than handing power to unaccountable bureaucrats, public ownership could be part of a new vision of democratising society – taking back control, if you will. The disillusionment with democracy, after all, has so much to do with governments hiving off their functions to markets, and then claiming impotence in the face of change. Privatisation never forged the popular capitalism promised by the “Tell Sid” British Gas advertising campaigns of the 1980s: by 2022, just 10.8% of UK shares were owned by individuals, down from 28.2% in 1981. Rather than handing wealth and power to the people, privatisation helped forge a model defined by low growth whose diminished proceeds disproportionately swell the bank accounts of a tiny few.

Handing power to the people away from the elites is a message that will resonate in an age of mass disillusionment. Alas, Labour has vacated so much space that even Farage can posture as an economic radical by comparison. That is a travesty. But as British Steel and flailing water profiteers underline, the old order is dying; its morbid symptoms are everywhere. What is needed now are politicians with the imagination and determination to build something else.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/15/british-steel-nationalisation-labour-keir-starmer-privatisation,1
Having as many babies as possible is not the only way to show you love humanity | Zoe Williams,"‘Perpetuating humanity should be a cross-politics consensus,” read an article in the Atlantic last week, “but the left was mostly absent at a recent pronatalism conference.” It’s such a simple proposition – everyone loves babies and wants the species to perpetuate, right? – but pronatalism has provoked a ferocious battle on the American left. Should they be trying to engage meaningfully at a preposterous far-right conference? Or should the left stop self-flagellating and start organising?

But what is pronatalism – and is it really borderline fascist? I don’t want to think about slippery, bad-faith, rightwing claptrap any more than you do, but in an era in which US politics can sneeze and the world catches encephalitis, we do, regrettably, have to think about bad-faith everything, all the time.

The motivation of the pronatalists is that birthrates are in decline, in some places (such as South Korea) so precipitously that the nation will soon cease to meaningfully exist. It has been a bugbear of the right, particularly the alt-tech right, for almost a decade. In 2017, Elon Musk wrote on Twitter: “The world’s population is accelerating towards collapse, but few seem to notice or care.” That was before he owned the platform, so few people noticed or cared. It has also been a thematic staple of Viktor Orbán’s rhetoric in Hungary, reinforced in 2019 by a large-family tax-break policy that in February became an income tax exemption for mothers of two or three children.

The ideas factories pushing birthrates have always been much more opaque about their politics; often, they frame their ideas to suit whomever they are talking to. When I interviewed Simone and Malcolm Collins, venture capitalists turned pronatal advocates, a couple of years ago, their line was that progressive politics needed higher birthrates. Political persuasion was “40% to 70% heritable”, Malcolm told me. “If you systematically delete everyone who cares about the environment from the gene pool, that means, within a couple of generations, you’re going to see a dramatic drop in the number of people who care about the climate, even as the collapse becomes more intense.”

At the last count, the Collinses had four children, plus a number of frozen embryos, which Simone intends to incubate at 18-month intervals. “We’re going to keep going until physically I can no longer have kids – and that will be when they forcibly remove my uterus,” she said. It was a dystopian image with a number of obvious follow-ups, the first of which was: who are “they”? But I didn’t ask any of them, because her perception of force, authority, uteruses, children and the world seemed dark and personal, like a subconscious gaping open.

Nor did I pursue whether Malcolm could possibly believe that you could sell to people who care about the environment the idea that only their biological children would be genetically capable of caring about the environment. It could be the child of someone who arrives on a small boat that solves our political malaise. What about the heritability of staunch determination? Did they ever think about that?

But, all too often, ethnonationalism is implicit in the pronatalist narrative: a low birthrate can’t be offset by migration, because they are not talking about people in general. They are talking about the right kind of people.

In the intervening years, Musk has had a bunch more children, often boasting of the example he is setting. Trump started saying: “You have good genes, you know that, right?” to his followers. Last week, the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, floated the idea that “if you are healthy, it’s almost impossible for you to be killed by an infectious disease in modern times”, which medics rebutted because it’s not true. But we should all fear its drumbeat: good stock is different; anyone who succumbs to an infectious disease wasn’t “healthy” to begin with.

These connections are often intellectually baggy – Musk’s desire to populate Mars with his own seed doesn’t map neatly on to RFK’s anti-vax agenda, while Orbán’s pronatalism sounds like socially conservative gender oppression, yet pronatalist forums tie themselves in knots trying to sound “woke”. But if this isn’t about ethnonationalism, then why aren’t the pronatalists crying out for countries with low birthrates to receive refugees with open arms?

The Guardian view on unpaid carers: the scandal of their allowances is far from over | Editorial,"The announcement by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) of a new regime for checking breaches of carer’s allowance rules is a milestone in the campaign to end the shockingly poor treatment of claimants. Rules directing officials to investigate only half of alerts about suspected overpayments are rightly being ditched. In future, all reports will be checked, so that claimants can be notified and avoid getting into debt.

This month’s lifting of the weekly earnings limit, from £151 to £196, is another step forward. Claimants can now work for the equivalent of 16 hours at the national living wage (NLW) without losing their entitlement to a carer’s allowance payment of £83.30. By pegging the earnings limit to the NLW, so that in future they rise in sync, ministers have made it less likely that pay rises will tip people unwittingly over the edge and into trouble. A government-ordered review by Liz Sayce, the disability expert, will soon make further recommendations, including what should happen to the outstanding debts that are blighting lives.

Ministers already know a good deal about the harm caused by years of official denial and obfuscation. It was nearly a decade ago that a DWP whistleblower first raised concerns about the way that those who overclaimed were being dealt with. He was wrongly fired, then reinstated, but debts and prosecutions kept mounting up. Currently, 144,000 claimants are in the process of repaying a total of £250m. A Guardian investigation last year revealed how hundreds of those with higher overpayments (more than £5,000) were taken to court, accused of fraud.

This terrible state of affairs should never have been allowed. It is a stain on the record of the last government that more was not done to sort it out. As long ago as 2019, the National Audit Office found that most wrongful claims were the result of mistakes. In light of this, the DWP should have been proactive in tackling them, rather than insisting that claimants bore legal responsibility, or putting its faith in a technological fix that never materialised.

Many of the 1 million people who receive carer’s allowance are already coping with very difficult circumstances, financially and in other ways. To be eligible in the first place, the person being cared for (almost always a relative) must be on disability benefits, and need at least 35 hours a week of help with tasks such as washing. Given that being out of work is the strongest predictor of poverty for unpaid carers, it has been utterly perverse to penalise them for weekly earnings above £151 – until last week the measly maximum.

Unpaid carers, many of whom are middle-aged women, are not the solution to the wider, demographic challenge of an ageing and increasingly unhealthy population. A new funding formula for the formal social care sector is essential, and cannot be put off much longer. But care, in its broader sense, will always encompass help that is given voluntarily – as well as that which is paid for. Care is what goes on within families as well as what is provided by care workers and in institutional settings.

These bonds between individuals and generations are part of the fabric of society. As well as the injustices it has exposed, the carer’s allowance scandal is about the troublingly low regard in which the DWP appears to hold them.

The Guardian view on Donald Trump’s industrial policy: inward turn by ultimatum | Editorial,"Globalisation is out; reshoring is the new realism. Intel’s half-built Ohio campus and Nvidia’s US supercomputer plan demonstrate the very different routes taken by Joe Biden and Donald Trump in the search for homegrown tech dominance. Mr Biden relied on institutions: grants, land and investment incentives. That approach has stalled after last year’s election, rendering Intel’s plant idle. Mr Trump prefers court politics: flattery, pressure and tariff threats. Nvidia’s move seems driven less by design than executive ultimatum. Industrial strategy lives on – but, and this is a concern, increasingly through presidential menace, not policy.

There’s another important message in the Nvidia announcement. In an era where ideas spread freely, power lies not in invention but in chokepoints, such as artificial intelligence supercomputer fabrication, that determine who can scale those ideas into global platforms. Remember that as the US braces for a backlash over the breakdown of the old trade order.

The Harvard economist Ricardo Hausmann has noted that Mr Trump’s miscalculation is focusing on goods trade, while ignoring the bigger game: services, intellectual property (IP) and investment. Boeing’s most profitable division is services, not manufacturing – but both will be hit by China’s decision to block further deliveries of its jets. Prof Hausmann warned that developing countries may retaliate by undermining the global Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement. Known as Trips, the IP regime stands behind $632bn in US overseas profits.

If Mr Trump has a plan, it’s well hidden. But perhaps his strategy is simply this: if others want to copy yesterday’s technologies or challenge IP norms, let them. The US, by this logic, will just invent the next indispensable thing – and charge to access it. America is a leader in AI, biotech and platform services. But recent developments complicate this picture. Open-source AI such as China’s DeepSeek shows that frontier tech no longer needs a Silicon Valley address.

In pharmaceuticals, a similar contradiction plays out. Eli Lilly’s blockbuster weight-loss drug Mounjaro had its formula made public under Food and Drug Administration rules – the price of market access. That transparency fuelled a global flood of generics and counterfeits. It’s the Trips dilemma: innovation demands openness, but imitation thrives where enforcement lags. Now, in a sharp escalation, the Trump administration has launched a national security probe into pharma imports. China, India and the EU, all major exporters, are in US crosshairs.

The deeper irony is that since 1945 the US has built its global position by championing openness – in science, trade and finance – yet it is now walling off supply chains and invoking security doctrines to shield its markets. Meanwhile, the very IP regime that helped extract “rents” from the world economy is under strain. The US may still dominate, but it’s on the defensive – onshoring production and securing chokepoints. In January, Mr Trump threatened 100% tariffs on any country daring to sidestep the dollar – and hence powerful US Treasury sanctions.

If developing countries begin to renege on Trips – no longer seeing value in enforcing patents in return for access to increasingly closed markets – the consequences will reach far beyond US firms. In 2023, India paid $14bn to foreign entities for using IP, up from $1.9bn in 2009, without much meaningful benefit in return. For now, the US may still invent the future. But whether America can own it, monetise it or exclude others from it remains uncertain. The age of innovation may be global. The age of power, increasingly, is not.

How Britain could forge a steelmaking revolution despite British Steel’s woes,"The plight of British Steel is an opportunity for a transformative change in the way steel is made (Editorial, 10 April). Blast furnaces depend on coal, and steelmaking emits well over a tonne of CO 2 for every tonne of steel, producing roughly a tenth of global CO 2 emissions. Using electric arc furnaces gets around this by recycling scrap metal, but doesn’t address the primary problem.

There are promising alternatives. These include making steel with hydrogen, and more advanced options such as the all-electric projects being supported by the US’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (Arpa-E). Scunthorpe is well placed for this, close to North Sea windfarms and able to exploit cheap surplus late-night electricity.

An attractive way forward would be to sustain the blast furnaces for a few more years, replacing one with an electric arc furnace. Meanwhile, the UK’s university skills could be used to develop a more innovative all-electric iron-ore-to-steel process. By making hi-tech steels that are stronger, and persuading engineers to use them, consumption and emissions can be cut significantly.

Steel is essential to Britain’s economy and security, and the government is right to protect steelmaking. But net zero is also essential to the planet’s security. Rather than abandoning the quest for net zero to perpetuate a loss-making and dying enterprise, the government has the option to foster real innovation: low-cost, low-carbon, world-leading.

Euan G Nisbet

Emeritus professor, Royal Holloway, University of London

Polly Toynbee highlights the fact that there are Conservatives who see the need for nationalisation in some circumstances (Labour has done right by British Steel – now it must speed up a radical strategy for all industry, 13 April). A prime example of this was when the Tory prime minister, Edward Heath, nationalised Rolls-Royce in 1971 when it was about to submerge in financial chaos. The principle of nationalisation when it is in the country’s interest was clearly established then.

Robin Davies

Tregarth, Gwynedd

The acquisition of British Steel in 2020 by the Chinese corporation Jingye was an example of economic globalisation on steroids. And see where it has got us.

Such globalisation – both the offshoring and the acquisition of British strategic industries and public utilities by foreign corporations – has seen our industrial sovereignty sacrificed for short-term profit, with jobs lost, and increased costs to consumers.

If one good thing comes from Donald Trump’s economic wrecking tactics, it will have been the end of globalisation – or at least its taming. And if the nationalisation of British Steel signals the beginning of the end for globalisation’s destructive impact on UK industry and jobs, I for one shall cheer. But will this Labour government be bold enough?

Everything your editorial said about British Steel has an exact analogue with the petrochemical plant at Grangemouth. If that closes, Scotland will be one of very few oil-producing countries without its own refining industry.

Threats to nature in Labour’s planning bill,"Re your article (Planning bill ‘throws environmental protection to the wind’, say UK nature chiefs, 9 April), while Labour’s planning and infrastructure bill aims for 1.5m homes to spur economic growth, part 3 of the bill threatens both nature and delivery.

The UK’s wildlife has declined 19% since 1970, with 16% of species at risk. Yet part 3’s environmental delivery plans allow developers to pay an unquantified levy for vague restoration, sidestepping the Environment Act’s principles of prevention and precaution, and risking irreversible harm to our iconic ecosystems such as chalk streams and woodlands.

The bill’s “overall improvement test” rests on weak “likely” benefits outweighing harm, ignoring scientific evidence, bypassing existing safeguards and failing to guarantee delivery of biodiversity gains. This may court illegality under the Berne convention, while complex levies and surveys could delay the housebuilding we need and lead to a “cash to trash” system.

Ministers promised a win-win for nature and development, but without amendments that ensure benefits precede harm and mandating “significant, measurable” gains – this is a loss for both. This isn’t obstructionism. It’s a plea for due process.

MPs must pause part 3, consult widely and align this legislation with the spirit and substance of the Environment Act and the climate and nature bill. Housing is urgent, but it doesn’t need to happen at nature’s expense. Nature isn’t a “nice to have”, it’s all we have.

Jude Bellingham targets remontada on ‘night that’s made for Real Madrid’,"Remontada, remontada, remontada.

“Honestly, I’ve heard it about a million times since last week,” Jude Bellingham said. No word has been repeated as often inside the dressing room or outside it either: on the front pages of the newspapers, on radio, TV and TikTok, where the Englishman apologetically admitted: “I get my education from these days,” or in the “million videos” he has watched. Bound into the mystique of Real Madrid, their never-ending story, it means comeback and it is written; it also means this isn’t over, even when it should be. Or so it goes.

And while it has been consciously created and cumulative, gathering pace as planned over the seven days that followed defeat in London, Bellingham says the belief was back even before they were: in fact, it was already there by the time they boarded the bus. Now it almost feels like it was better to lose the first leg to Arsenal 3-0. He knows that sounds as absurd as it surely is, and was keen to analyse the flaws to be addressed, but this way the second leg is set up to be more epic, more like them. “A night that’s made for Real Madrid,” Bellingham called it, one that “would go down in history but also something people here are familiar with”.

“After the game it’s normally really tough: you’re sitting around on your own and you do think it’s difficult,” the Madrid midfielder admitted. “But the more you get speaking to the other lads and you see how confident they are, the more it rubs off on you. Lads who have lived these nights before. It’s infectious, it makes you a lot more confident, a lot more comfortable about the situation you’re in and the people you’re going into it with. For us, it was pretty much immediate. By the time we were back on the coach we were all … not in good spirits, obviously, but we realised we could still be in the competition.

“It’s been a weird environment the last few days: it’s one of the worst results we could possibly imagine away and for some reason everyone thinks it’s now done that we will come back.”

Logically, the situation is not good. But Madrid have built a history around defying logic: not just recently, but going all the way back to one night against Derby in 1975, a 5-1 Bernabéu victory overturning a 4-1 defeat at the Baseball Ground. In the 1980s, the epic became their thing, an identity built upon it. Even if the stats show it’s not quite as inevitable as it seems, not quite as tales told it, the stories were told and still are; over these last seven days, especially. “I’ve heard Emilio [Butragueño, the former striker who is now a director] talking about the one where they won 6-1 against Anderlecht and I’ve seen the clips,” Bellingham said. “That’s something you want to be part of. You want to add to the history of the club.”

Not that it’s just about the past, or even just about madness, that moment when everyone loses their minds and the impossible takes over. In fact, Madrid’s coach, Carlo Ancelotti, talked instead of the need for control, insisted “there is no magic”; his team require a plan, clear focus, not simply to be carried along by the emotion, the occasion. Borrowing a line from the tennis player Carlos Alcaraz, he called for “cabeza, corazón y cojones”: head, heart and balls.

Bellingham, too, was conscious that things have to change. Asked what they had to be, in purely football terms, he replied: “A lot better than in the first leg, that’s for sure. Higher commitment, a better understanding of what we have to do, cleaner with the ball, better on transitions … there are a multitude of things. There wasn’t one aspect of our game where we were good enough and you have to not be afraid to say that. We know we can do better. It is one thing to lose, another not to learn.”

In the first leg, Madrid ran 14km less than Arsenal, a simple but significant statistic. “You always give yourself a better chance if you run more, if you match the other team,” Bellingham explained. “14km: that’s, what, one player and a bit. Of course that makes an impact. Last year we didn’t always run the most but we were in an organised position, so there’s an element of knowing which spaces to cover that doesn’t involve running like a headless chicken. It’s finding the balance, a mix we didn’t do well at the Emirates. Hopefully tomorrow we will be willing to run a lot more and have a better plan too.”

When he was told that they hadn’t won a game by more than a solitary goal since February, let alone three of them, Bellingham said simply: “It’s a different night, innit.” Their kind of night.",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/15/jude-bellingham-targets-remontada-on-night-thats-made-for-real-madrid,1
Bournemouth plan contract talks with Iraola to ward off Tottenham interest,"Bournemouth’s owner, Bill Foley, is planning contract talks with Andoni Iraola next week and there is ­growing confidence at the club that the in-demand head coach can be persuaded to stay. The Spaniard’s contract expires at the end of next season and Foley wants him to sign a longer deal, despite interest from clubs such as Tottenham. Foley is due to fly to Bournemouth after Easter and meet Iraola to discuss the future, with a new contract on offer.

Ange Postecoglou is under huge pressure at Tottenham after losing 17 Premier League games and only winning the Europa League could keep him in the job. Spurs play their quarter-final second leg at Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday, with the tie finely balanced at 1-1.

Iraola has been identified as one of the leading domestic candidates to replace Postecoglou should the ­chair, Daniel Levy, make a change, with ­Fulham’s Marco Silva and ­Brentford’s Thomas Frank also highly rated. Bournemouth have not held formal talks with Iraola, but believe he will stay, particularly if the club qualify for Europe for the first time.

After six games without a win, Bournemouth beat Fulham on Monday to go eighth in the ­Premier League, which could yield a ­Conference League place.

Iraola achieved Bournemouth’s record points tally of 48 last season and has matched that with six games remaining. His energetic football has won many admirers, although some have questioned whether the 42-year-old’s preference for ­counterattacking would translate to a side accustomed to dominating ­possession, such as Tottenham.

Although Iraola is ambitious and wants to work at the highest level he is happy at Bournemouth, who give him considerable influence over transfers, backed by the ­data-led approach brought by Foley’s Black Knight Sports and Entertainment ownership group.

The signings of Milos Kerkez, Dean Huijsen and Evanilson have been masterstrokes, and with ­Bournemouth comfortably inside the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules threshold the club can demand high prices this summer.

The £55m sale of Dominic Solanke to Tottenham was the only ­significant departure last summer and with ­long-term contracts in place ­Bournemouth are confident of ­keeping most of the squad together.

Iraola joined Bournemouth on a two-year contract and signed an extension last May. At his ­previous club, Rayo Vallecano, whom he guided to promotion to La Liga before keeping them in the top flight for two seasons, he preferred to work on a 12-month rolling contract.",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/15/bournemouth-plan-contract-talks-with-iraola-to-ward-off-tottenham-interest,1
Steve Diamond’s season-ending ban was for profanity aimed at match officials,"Steve Diamond’s season-ending ban was meted out because he called a group of match‑day officials “cunts” before telling the television match official he should retire.

The Newcastle director of rugby was given a six-match suspension last week after a disciplinary ­hearing into an incident that took place in the dying throes of the Falcons’ late defeat by fellow strugglers Exeter last month.

Diamond was found guilty of directing verbal abuse at match officials and the publication of the full written judgment details the incident. At the hearing, Diamond admitted using “industrial language” and expressed frustration at himself. He also claimed to have been being “sarcastic” with officials with whom he shares a “kinship”.

The Rugby Football Union has ­introduced stricter sanctions at all levels of the game, including the ­Premiership, after almost 50% of match officials surveyed said they have been subjected to abuse in recent seasons.

The incident took place after Newcastle’s late 17-15 defeat by Exeter on 29 March. The Chiefs were victorious thanks to a late Greg Fisilau try, but in the buildup, the Exeter centre Tamati Tua appeared to elbow the Falcons wing Alex Hearle in the head. The disciplinary judgment notes the force was such that Hearle’s mouthguard was dislodged and he has not played since.

Diamond was aggrieved the incident was not reviewed and shortly afterwards, when walking past the referee, Adam Leal, and his assistants in the tunnel, said: “I hope you cunts can sleep tonight.”

Diamond gave evidence that he remained calm throughout what he considered a private conversation.

About 45 minutes later, while the TMO, David Rose, was having his post-match meal, Diamond told him: “You need to retire, you need to retire.”

Two days later, Diamond sent emails to Rose and Leal apologising for his comments.

The disciplinary panel found both comments constituted verbal abuse of match officials. The ­judgment states Diamond “does not blame anyone but himself”, but that he sought to explain the context of a match between the Premiership’s bottom two clubs “who are struggling financially”. The ­judgment also notes that the RFU’s head of professional game officials, Paul Hull, has indicated the incident involving Tua and Hearle ought to have resulted in a penalty for Newcastle.

Diamond had been supported by a character reference from ­Graham Crozier, a senior member of the Northumberland Rugby Union ­Referees’ Society. In mid-March, ­Diamond gave a speech for the ­society and he praised officials in the community game. In giving evidence, he said he believes there is a difference between professional referees who are paid and referees in the community game who are not.

Addressing his suspension on Tuesday, Diamond called for more accountability in refereeing ­decisions. “As soon as anybody says something outside of their realm, they corral the caravans around themselves and protect themselves. Let’s be honest, I’ve got a six-week ban for saying an inappropriate ­comment – which I’ve apologised for – to a professional referee in complete privacy.

“We understand we have to have regulation and understand I can’t say what I said, but there’s got to be some accountability otherwise people keep making mistakes.”",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/15/steve-diamond-season-ending-ban-was-for-abusing-match-officials-rugby-union,1
"Carlton Fairweather, former Wimbledon midfielder, dies aged 63","The former Wimbledon Crazy Gang member and Sunderland coach ­Carlton Fairweather has died at the age of 63. Fairweather, who enjoyed a 22-year association with Sunderland in various coaching and community roles after his playing career, died surrounded by his family on Monday night, months after it was revealed he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

Sunderland’s sporting director, Kristjaan Speakman, told the club website: “Carlton’s personality and charisma were unique. He worked across all aspects of our club and the reason he’s so highly thought of is down to his dedication, humility, and work ethic. He will be truly missed by all within our club.”

Fairweather, who managed Sunderland Women during their time in the English top flight, held a series of coaching roles at the club after making 164 appearances for the Dons – although he missed out on their 1988 FA Cup final victory over Liverpool through injury – before spells with Carlisle and in Hong Kong and the United States.

Flat season returns to HQ in pursuit of racing immortality – with a few swallows,"After weeks of unseasonably warm temperatures, the only hint of spring as Newmarket opened its doors for a new season here on Tuesday was a small flight of ­swallows over the Rowley Mile – back from Africa in time for a wet and chilly first day at the Craven meeting. Weather-wise, it felt more like Plumpton in January than the home of Flat racing on the first afternoon of a new campaign.

But the conditions could not dampen the sense of opening-day anticipation as the first of 2025’s Guineas hopefuls went to post for their Classic trials on the Rowley Mile, before a potential tilt at racing immortality back here in less than three weeks.

The Craven meeting is all about the future, from the unraced juveniles breezing alongside the track in the morning before going under the hammer at Tattersalls a few hours later to the potential Group One winners blowing away the winter cobwebs on a course that staged the first race run under an official set of rules all the way back in 1666.

On Tuesday, it was the turn of the three-year-old fillies with Classic aspirations as 10 runners lined up for the Nell Gwyn, including six with an entry in the 1,000 Guineas on 4 May. It was one of the other four that emerged in front, however, as John and Thady Gosden’s Zanzoun, a 9-1 shot, quickened one and three-quarter lengths clear of Celestial Orbit, also at 9-1, with the 20-1 chance Remaat back in third.

View image in fullscreen Zanzoun ridden by Kieran Shoemark winning the Nell Gwyn Stakes at Newmarket. Photograph: Ian Headington/racingfotos.com/Shutterstock

Zanzoun is certainly bred to win a Classic, with the uber-stallions Dubawi and Frankel on either side of her pedigree, but a trip to Paris for the Poule D’Essai Des Pouliches – the French equivalent of the 1,000 Guineas – seems a more likely target than the much shorter journey back down the road from the Gosdens’ yard in 20 days’ time.

“That could well be the case,” John Gosden said. “There is a very good Aga Khan filly [Zarigana] we saw the other day in the Prix De La Grotte, but it’s lovely to win here and we’ve got nice plans to make.”

Newmarket’s main Guineas trial for colts, the Craven Stakes over the full Classic trip of a mile, will be run here on Wednesday, but there was a likely runner in the 2,000 Guineas on the track before racing on Tuesday as Hugo Palmer took the chance to exercise Seagulls Eleven, a son of the trainer’s 2016 2,000 Guineas winner, Galileo Gold, on the Rowley Mile.

Seagulls Eleven is a 50-1 shot for the Guineas but kept very good company as a juvenile, ending his two-year-old campaign with three runs in Group One company including a one-and-a-half-length third behind ­Scorthy Champ and Henri ­Matisse, the subsequent Breeders’ Cup ­Juvenile Turf winner, in the National Stakes at the Curragh.

That form offers real hope to Palmer and Seagulls Eleven’s owners, a syndicate of current and former Brighton & Hove Albion players, that their £50k purchase – a relative pittance for a Guineas hope – will not be out of place among the best of his generation in next month’s Classic.

None of the syndicate are likely to be there to watch him run, however, as Brighton are at home to Newcastle – Palmer’s team – on the Sunday of Guineas weekend, although the goalkeeper Jason Steele was at Newmarket for Tuesday’s gallop.

“I’ve only won one Guineas and we brought his dad here to gallop as well, and they do look very similar,” Palmer said. “It’s a very open renewal, although Aidan [O’Brien] seems to sound like he’s basically got it won and he might only run one horse [Twain], and I do remember him saying that about Air Force Blue [the beaten favourite in 2016] as well.

“I think we all think that footballers play 90 minutes of football on a Saturday and spend the rest of the time racing their Ferraris around but they are incredibly busy guys. All of them played for Brighton when we bought the horse, but a few have moved on. Brighton actually play Newcastle on 1,000 Guineas day, so I think they should all come here and get absolutely wrecked the day before.”

Opera on song for the Craven

Eight of the nine runners in Wednesday’s Craven Stakes at Newmarket still hold an entry in next month’s 2,000 Guineas and half a dozen of those ended their juvenile season in Group One events, but the most interesting runner in the field is arguably Charlie Appleby’s Opera Ballo (3.35), who did not race at two and is stepping into Group-race company for the first time.

Appleby’s Notable Speech, last year’s 2,000 Guineas winner, was the first colt to win the Classic without having raced as a juvenile for 86 years. He started his racing career in minor events at Kempton in January and February, and Opera Ballo arrives at the Craven having won the same two races in impressive style.

He also posted a very fast time when quickening four lengths clear under a hand ride on his latest start, and is a decent bet at around 4-1 to improve past his more experienced opponents and preserve his unbeaten record.

Newmarket 1.50 Double Rush was much improved when switched to the all-weather for his three-year-old debut and still has plenty in hand even from his reassessed mark if he is anywhere close to that form back on turf.

Cheltenham 2.05 The novice Typhoon Flyer was an emphatic winner on decent ground at Haydock last time and is a fair price at around 5-1 to continue his progress off a 6lb higher mark.

Newmarket 2.25 No form at all in this traditional event for unraced three-year-olds, but Muhaajim boasts an impeccable pedigree and his trainer knows what is required in this race.

Cheltenham 2.40 Runners from the title-chasing yards dominate the market and Tom Lacey’s Blow Your Wad, a Grade Two-winning novice who ran well on his belated return to action in February, may have crept in at a value price as result.

Women’s football in France changing but Lyon-PSG duopoly hard to break,"A big change occurred in France last summer when the top two divisions of the women’s game were professionalised under the banner of the new Ligue Féminine de Football Professionnel (LFFP), led by the former Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas.

With the aim of making a league dominated for almost two decades by Aulas’s former club and Paris Saint-Germain more interesting, the changes included a rebranding of the top two divisions, an overall budget increase for the league stretching into eight figures, plus mandatory criteria such as every top division side having a minimum 11 full-time players, with second division sides having at least 11 contracted part-time players. Clubs can now have a fourth non-EU player, while those involved in the new structure have taken lessons from other leagues such as rest days for teams in the Champions League and canvassing supporters for the best kick-off times.

The aim has been to improve standards and create a more competitive league, but with two games to go it is once again Lyon and PSG running away with things. Plus ça change, as they say.

But beneath the surface, the changes are being welcomed, even by those who, in the long run, may be left behind as bigger names fight for promotion to the top division. Among them are fourth-placed Dijon, almost certain to clinch their first spot in the end of season playoffs, and Fleury, sat just behind in fifth, who last season knocked Lyon out of the domestic cup on the way to a historic final.

With their men’s teams sat in the third and fourth tiers respectively, both are massively punching above their weight – sitting above sides such as Montpellier, Nantes and Saint-Étienne – but have welcomed the increased professionalisation.

“There has already been really good communication with the LFFP, because we had no communication with the FFF [French Football Federation],” says Sylvain Carric, who runs the women’s football side of Dijon. “We have support on marketing structures, as well as contracts negotiated with Catapult and MyCoach, for example, for performance and medical matters to offer more support to the players.”

Carric believes the biggest challenge is to make the game financially independent, but with Dijon already fully professional the change has been more difficult for Fleury, especially after they lost their head coach, Fabrice Abriel, to PSG last summer along with some key players.

“A higher level of standard is required from the club now in terms of infrastructure,” says Fleury’s president, Pascal Bovis. “The quality of pitches and floodlights, the structure, medical care, staff, the qualifications of coaches and our communications and media departments. But the change is under way and very important in the long term because the professional league will generate revenue that will transfer directly to the club.”

While Lyon and PSG continue to dominate, Bovis points to recent results as proof other sides can continue to compete and believes “it’s good to have a driving force pulling us up”, with regards to France’s top two sides. “The budgets of Lyon and PSG are very large, but also Paris FC now, with Louis Vuitton as the new owner, can compete at least.

“Fleury, for example, has only lost 2-1 in Paris [to PSG] for the past three seasons and has drawn three times at home, including a legendary 4-4 draw three years ago. It is proof of a smaller sporting gap despite large budget differences.”

While six points separate them, Dijon’s professional structure has allowed them to jump from eighth to fourth this season, even though Fleury are playing catch-up when it comes to the new criteria imposed on clubs. “We have 19 professional players, six technical staff and three medical staff,” says Carric, but it is different for Bovis and Fleury.

“We don’t benefit from the professional infrastructure the other women’s teams have, being backed by a professional men’s club,” says Bovis. “This is our weakness, but we’re working to overcome all of this. On the other hand, our structure is as important as other teams, or perhaps even better, our staff includes a former coach of the France Under-23 team, as does the medical team.”

View image in fullscreen Dijon’s professional structure has allowed them to jump from eighth to fourth this season. Photograph: Icon Sport/Getty Images

Does that create a greater fear of bigger clubs on the rise, with Nantes promoted last season and already established in seventh in the top division, with others such as Marseille and Lens possibly on the way? “No, on the contrary,” says Bovis. “This will make the championship even more attractive. It’s up to us to stay smart in our recruitment, to maintain the club’s unique spirit and to continue to perform despite our unique status. But isn’t that also the charm of football? And that’s why we love it … ”

Handmade balls and no two courts the same: Tudor-era ‘real tennis’ is making a racket in Sydney,"“It’s a bit like three-dimensional chess, and it’s much more intellectual than an average sport because it’s so complicated,” Maggie Henderson-Tew says through a wide grin after walking off the court.

Amid an explosion of interest in newfangled racket sports such as pickleball and padel, which have found popularity due to their dynamic, speedy and easy to learn styles of play, one Sydney sports club is instead leaning into the past – specifically, the Tudor period.

This week, Sydney became home to Australia’s fourth court for “real tennis” – also known as royal tennis – the precursor sport to what would evolve to be modern-day tennis (or “lawn tennis”) and squash.

View image in fullscreen The club says initial interest from the community has been strong, with a steady stream of private bookings from first-timers as well as those who had played in the past. Photograph: James Gourley/Publishd

Unlike the low barriers to entry that have seen pickleball and padel gain broad appeal, real tennis’s attraction is in its quirks of tradition, cumbersome equipment and labyrinthine scoring system.

“People get absolutely fanatically into it, but it’s incredibly frustrating when you start out until you hit your first good shot, then it feels phenomenal,” says Henderson-Tew.

“If you can hit one in every 20 balls your first time playing that’s a very good sign. You have to get down low like handball because the ball doesn’t really bounce,” she says.

‘It takes two years of playing to be hopeless’

While initially known as jeu de paume – French for “palm game” – real tennis has progressed to be played with rackets, albeit ones with an offset head to mimic the angle of an outstretched hand.

“A racket is essentially an arm on a stick, with a tiny sweet spot,” Henderson-Tew says. These days, just one company, Grays, produces rackets for the sport, in a side operation it’s understood to not make a profit from.

Despite the game continuing to be played through to the present day in the UK, US, Australia and France – Sydney’s new court is just the world’s 50th – competition rackets are made of wood, and can feel closer to a cricket bat than a state-of-the-art lawn tennis racket.

Asymmetry in real tennis extends far beyond its rackets.

Courts, which are rectangular and built with roofs, include sloped sections on three of the four walls – the sport itself was spun out of how handball would be played in courtyards and streets in medieval times, and some say the slopes are inspired by what would have been awnings covering shops.

Every point must begin by serving the ball on to a specific slope – or “penthouse” as it is known – while the loud thud of a ball landing on one of the slopes before bouncing down closely resembles the soundscape of a bowling alley.

There are also various netted “openings” around the court, spread asymmetrically around the walls, whose functions are similar to activating a mini-game on a lifesize pinball machine.

Hitting the ball in some of the openings is one way to win a point outright. However, if a serving player slightly mis-hits the ball into a different adjacent opening, they can lose serve mid-game and trigger a change of ends. Such an occurrence leads to what is called a “chase”, which must be resolved through play from a range of dozens of different fixed positions on the court.

The scoring system might be the most striking resemblance to the sport played at the Australian Open or Wimbledon, in that games are run to a love-15-30-40 score.

But that’s where the similarities end. Points are won by hitting winning openings or if an opponent sends a ball into the drooping net. A double bounce does not mean a lost point. Tournament matches can be played to as many as the best of 13 sets over three days.

Both singles and doubles competitions are played, but “triples” games have been discontinued, now considered too dangerous. The world’s best professionals compete at the top level into their 50s.

The convoluted rules and difficulty of play are poked fun at by many at Sydney’s new club.

“It takes two years of playing to be hopeless,” jokes Chris Ronaldson, a former world champion of the sport.

He and his wife, Henderson-Tew, moved from Radley College, a school in Oxfordshire in the UK where they helmed a real tennis court, to Sydney six months ago to help prepare the club.

Ronaldson was tasked with one of the sport’s more bizarre tasks. Balls for real tennis are not mass produced. Instead, each clubhouse must make them individually by hand by wrapping cork in cotton webbing before sewing them up in yellow cloth.

Since arriving in Sydney, Ronaldson, now 75, has made about 300 balls, mostly from his garage while waiting for the court’s to be completed. Each one takes him about 40 minutes.

New court for an old sport

For decades, the Sydney Real Tennis Club has been a nomadic group, travelling to courts in Melbourne, Hobart and Ballarat. In the late 1990s, a court was built at Sydney’s Macquarie University, but this proved unpopular among students and disagreements between the club and university management saw it turned into a childcare centre after seven years.

The club spent years searching for a new base and lobbying for support, ultimately settling on the Cheltenham Recreation Club, on Sydney’s leafy north shore, as the premises to build its new court.

The success of the campaign was largely due to a New South Wales government grant. At the club’s official opening ceremony on Monday, former local MP and premier Dominic Perrottet was acknowledged for his role in securing the $1.4m grant for construction – an impressive amount of public money for a sports club with roughly 30 registered players.

Now, after 20 years in the wilderness, as of this week Sydney has once again hosted competitive real tennis, with players from Britain and the United States joining contestants from interstate who travelled to Cheltenham for the inaugural Bilby competition.

Chris Cooper, the club’s secretary, says initial interest from the community has been strong, with a steady stream of private bookings from first-timers as well as others “coming out of the woodworks” who had played in the past.

“Percentage wise it’s one of the fastest growing sports in the country,” he jokes.

Attracting the levels of traction that pickleball has come to enjoy may prove ambitious, though, given the sport’s complexity and obscurity.

Ronaldson is enthusiastic about his sport’s latest venue, but encourages new players not to be dissuaded by the initial difficulty of learning how to hit what are much heavier balls, less bouncy with even heavier rackets.

In addition to players having to adapt to subtleties in an away club’s homemade balls, the dimensions and designs of actual courts also vary slightly – no two courts are the same.

“We’ve designed our court with a few little idiosyncrasies that give us a home advantage,” Cooper says. That includes a protrusion of one the court’s walls that slopes at a steeper angle.

With the club now up and running, Ronaldson and Henderson-Tew will return to the UK. Taking over as the club’s resident professional is Alex Marino-Hume.

The 29-year-old – a former choral singer who performed at King Charles’s coronation – joins from the real tennis club at Lord’s in London, and has relocated here with his wife, Charlotte, for four years. Managing the club will be his full-time profession.

At this week’s tournament, most players have so far skewed older and male. Despite its royal associations, Marino-Hume is aiming to make the club inclusive, and is hoping to see many women and children take it up.

“It’s not elite, it started in the streets,” Marino-Hume says.

Charlotte is starting out with modest goals – like finding a competent hitting partner.

"Deadly floods and storms affected more than 400,000 people in Europe in 2024","The home-wrecking storms and floods that swept Europe last year affected 413,000 people, a report has found, as fossil fuel pollution forced the continent to suffer through its hottest year on record.

Dramatic scenes of cars piled up on inundated streets and bridges being ripped away by raging torrents were seen around the continent in 2024, with “high” floods on 30% of the European river network and 12% crossing the “severe” flood threshold, according to the European State of the Climate report.

The two most destructive examples were the deluges that tore through central Europe in September and eastern Spain in October, which accounted for more than 250 of the 335 flooding deaths recorded across the continent in 2024.

Previous studies have found the disasters were made stronger and more likely because of global heating, which lets clouds pummel the ground with more rain.

Celeste Saulo, director general of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), said “every additional fraction of a degree” of temperature rise mattered, but that societies must also adapt to a hotter world.

“We are making progress but need to go further and need to go faster,” she said. “And we need to go together.”

The report, which was published on Tuesday by the EU’s Copernicus climate change service and the WMO, found the numbers of days with “strong”, “very strong” and “extreme heat stress” were all the second-highest on record.

South-eastern Europe experienced its longest heatwave on record in July 2024, searing more than half the region for 13 days in a row, while high heat across the continent contributed to destructive wildfires that affected 42,000 people, the report found. About one-quarter of Europe’s burnt area last year came from devastating wildfires in Portugal in September, which burned about 110,000 hectares in a single week.

Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London and co-lead of World Weather Attribution, who was not involved in the study, said the report “lays bare the pain Europe’s population is already suffering from extreme weather” at 1.3C of global heating above preindustrial levels.

“We’re on track to experience 3C by 2100,” she said. “You only need to cast your mind back to the floods in Spain, the fires in Portugal, or the summer heatwaves last year to know how devastating this level of warming would be.”

The report authors highlighted an “unusual” contrast between western and eastern Europe, with the west tending to be wet and cloudy and the east warm and sunny. River flows tended to be above average in western countries and below average in eastern ones. In several months last year, the Thames in the UK and the Loire in France experienced their highest flows in a 33-year record, the report found.

View image in fullscreen Glaciers on the continent experienced more net loss that ever previously recorded. Photograph: Ondrej Prosicky/Shutterstock

Glaciers in all regions had net ice loss, with those in Scandinavia and Svalbard losing more mass than ever previously recorded, according to the report. The authors also noted high temperatures north of the Arctic Circle, and the hottest sea surface temperature recorded in the Mediterranean.

Froila Palmeiro, a climate scientist at the Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change, who was not involved in the report, said the extremes “not only have a direct impact on their ecosystems, but also play a role in weather patterns affecting all of Europe”.

Europe is warming twice as fast as the global average but has cut its planet-heating pollution faster than other big economies. The EU plans to hit net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and is expected to also announce a net 90% reduction target for 2040 later this year.

Thomas Gelin, a climate campaigner at Greenpeace EU, said the report showed that politicians had failed to hold fossil fuel companies accountable and stop the expansion of their polluting businesses.

“The only parts of Europe that aren’t being boiled dry are being washed away in floods,” he said. “The EU must urgently update its climate targets to reflect the scientific reality, and put a stop to new fossil fuel projects as a first step to a full phase-out.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/15/europe-storms-floods-and-wildfires-in-2024-affected-more-than-400000,1
Green groups sue Trump administration over climate webpage removals,"Green groups have sued the Trump administration over the removal of government webpages containing federal climate and environmental justice data that they described as “tantamount to theft”.

In the first weeks of its second term, the Trump administration pulled federal websites tracking shifts in the climate, pollution and extreme weather impacts on low-income communities, and identifying pieces of infrastructure that are extremely vulnerable to climate disasters.

“The public has a right to access these taxpayer-funded datasets,” said Gretchen Goldman, president of the science advocacy non-profit Union of Concerned Scientists, which is a plaintiff in the lawsuit. “From vital information for communities about their exposure to harmful pollution to data that help local governments build resilience to extreme weather events, the public deserves access to federal datasets.”

“Removing government datasets is tantamount to theft,” Goldman added.

Filed in a Washington DC district court on Monday, the litigation was brought against federal agencies by the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Sierra Club and the Environmental Integrity Project climate groups; the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen; and the anti-pollution group California Communities Against Toxics.

It identifies six crucial government-run sites that have been pulled, arguing they must be restored. They include a Biden-era screening tool created to identify disadvantaged communities that would benefit from federal climate and clean energy investments, and an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mapping tool called EJScreen which showed the disparate burdens of pollution alongside socioeconomic indicators.

The lawsuit also highlights the Department of Energy’s map of resources for energy affordability in low-income communities, and a Department of Transportation Equitable Transportation Community interactive map of transportation insecurity, climate risk and economic vulnerability. Another now defunct tool it spotlights: the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s future risk index, meant to help cities, states and businesses prepare for worsening extreme weather, which was re-created by the Guardian last month.

“Simply put, these data and tools save lives, and efforts to delete, unpublish or in any way remove them jeopardize people’s ability to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and live safe and healthy lives,” said Ben Jealous, executive director of the Sierra Club.

Though publications including the Guardian, as well as advocacy groups, have published some recently pulled datasets on newly created webpages, in the absence of resources to continue gathering and publicizing new data, these datasets cannot be updated.

Last month, groups also sued the Trump administration over the US Department of Agriculture’s removal of climate data.

The lawsuit comes as federal officials also fire swaths of federal employees working on climate, environmental and justice-related initiatives, and enact sweeping rollbacks of green policies and regulations.

“The removal of these websites and the critical data they hold is yet another direct attack on the communities already suffering under the weight of deadly air and water,” said Jealous.

"Climate crisis has tripled length of deadly ocean heatwaves, study finds","The climate crisis has tripled the length of ocean heatwaves, a study has found, supercharging deadly storms and destroying critical ecosystems such as kelp forests and coral reefs.

Half of the marine heatwaves since 2000 would not have happened without global heating, which is caused by burning fossil fuels. The heatwaves have not only become more frequent but also more intense: 1C warmer on average, but much hotter in some places, the scientists said.

The research is the first comprehensive assessment of the impact of the climate crisis on heatwaves in the world’s oceans, and it reveals profound changes. Hotter oceans also soak up fewer of the carbon dioxide emissions that are driving temperatures up.

“Here in the Mediterranean, we have some marine heatwaves that are 5C hotter,” said Dr Marta Marcos at the Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies in Mallorca, Spain, who led the study. “It’s horrible when you go swimming. It looks like soup.”

As well as devastating underwater ecosystems such as sea grass meadows, Marcos said: “Warmer oceans provide more energy to the strong storms that affect people at the coast and inland.”

One disastrous example was the intense rainfall that caused catastrophic flooding in Libya in 2023, which killed 11,000 people. It was made up to 50 times more likely by global heating, which had raised temperatures in the Mediterranean by as much as 5.5C. That resulted in more water vapour and therefore more rain.

“The only solution is cutting the burning of fossil fuels. This is a very clear relationship,” said Marcos. “More than 90% of the extra heat [trapped by greenhouse gas emissions] is stored in the ocean. If you stop warming the atmosphere, you will stop warming the ocean.”

Recent major marine heatwaves include an exceptionally long event in the Pacific in 2014-15, which caused mass mortality among marine life. Intense heat hit the Tasman Sea in 2015-16 and record sea temperatures around the UK and in the Mediterranean Sea in 2023. Scientists had warned in 2019 that ocean heatwaves were increasing sharply, killing swathes of sea-life like “wildfires that take out huge areas of forest”.

Dr Zoe Jacobs at the UK’s National Oceanography Centre, who was not part of the study team, said: “Ocean heatwaves pose significant risks to society, with some individual events causing millions of dollars of losses due to impacts on the fishing, aquaculture and tourism industries. They have also been found to exacerbate heatwaves on land and have amplified extreme weather like hurricanes and storms.”

The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, built a model of sea surface temperatures since 1940 that removed the heating the climate crisis has caused. They then compared that with actual measurements from the oceans to show how global heating has pushed up temperatures. They focused on summer heatwaves, because they reach the highest temperatures and are therefore the most damaging.

The analysis revealed there were about 15 days of extreme heat a year at the ocean surface in the 1940s, but the figure had jumped to a global average of nearly 50 days a year. Some regions, including the Indian Ocean, the tropical Atlantic and the western Pacific have 80 heatwave days a year, ie one day in every five.

The seas in the tropics are already warm, so the extra heat tends to increase the duration of heatwaves. In cooler seas, the extra heat also can drive up their intensity, as seen in the Mediterranean Sea and the North Sea.

Dr Xiangbo Feng at the University of Reading, who was part of the study team, said: “As global temperatures continue to rise, marine heatwaves will become even more common and severe. Human activities are fundamentally changing our oceans. Urgent climate action is needed to protect marine environments.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/14/climate-crisis-has-tripled-length-of-deadly-ocean-heatwaves-study-finds,1
Weather tracker: north-west Italy braces for thunderstorms and snow,"North-west Italy is braced for heavy rainfall and thunderstorms across the southern side of the Alps, particularly in Piedmont and Liguria.

Turin and Genoa are expected to be among the worst affected, with snowfall also likely on higher ground. The region has been forecast to receive 140-160mm of rainfall between Sunday and Friday this week.

Turin could face 50-60mm of rain on Wednesday alone – equivalent to north-west Italy’s average rainfall for the entire month of April – with a chance of flooding and landslides.

Corsica is expected to be hit by significant rainfall totals of more than 120mm in places. Tuscany is under alert for rainfall totals exceeding 55mm from Monday.

The stormy weather is driven by a developing low-pressure system over the region, which is drawing in warm, moist air from the Tyrrhenian Sea. As this air mass meets the Alps, it is being forced upwards, triggering rapid condensation and heavy precipitation as a result of orographic lift.

Meanwhile, central and eastern Europe could get an early taste of summer this week, with unusually high temperatures forecast across several countries.

Daytime highs of up to 24C (75F) are likely in Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia – more than 10C above the seasonal average.

Berlin could top 26C on Wednesday and Thursday, while temperatures in the Polish city of Łódź and Albania’s capital, Tirana, could climb past 28C, a sharp departure from typical mid-April conditions.

The warm spell follows Europe’s hottest March on record, according to the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. Experts say this may signal a challenging summer, with an increased risk of severe heatwaves and wildfires across the continent.

Over the weekend, Storm Olivier swept across the Canary Islands, lashing tourist hotspots such as Tenerife, Gran Canaria and Fuerteventura. Lanzarote was hit particularly hard and received 60mm of rainfall on Saturday. Homes and streets were flooded with muddy water that triggered widespread power outages and flight cancellations.

Spanish authorities declared a state of emergency after more than 300 weather-related incidents.

Recovery efforts are under way, with emergency crews using pumps to drain flood waters and begin repairs.

With the Easter holidays in full swing for many travellers, Storm Olivier has caused significant disruption across the region.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/14/weather-tracker-north-west-italy-braces-for-thunderstorms-and-snow,1
"Birmingham bin strikes could spread, union leader warns","Bin strikes could spread to other council areas across the country as cash-strapped local authorities make further cuts, a union leader has warned as the dispute between refuse workers and the city council in Birmingham continues.

There have been warnings of a public health emergency in Birmingham as bin bags have piled up in the streets and there has been an influx of rats, more than a month after refuse collectors launched an all-out indefinite strike.

The general secretary of Unite, which is representing the striking bin workers, said there could be more strikes in other parts of the country as workers pushed back against pay cuts and job losses.

“If other councils decide to make low-paid workers pay for bad decisions that they did not make, workers paying the price yet again, then absolutely, of course, we all have to take action in those other areas,” Sharon Graham told LBC.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4, Onay Kasab, the union’s national lead officer, added: “If other local authorities look to cut the pay of essential public service workers, then there is the potential for strike action spreading. That’s why different political choices need to be made.”

The dispute in Birmingham, where the council declared itself effectively bankrupt in 2023, has been triggered by the council’s decision to cut a role from its bin lorry fleets, which it claims it needs to do to save money and prevent any future equal pay liability.

There have been similar disputes in response to council cutbacks in other parts of the country.

In Peterborough, the GMB union has been in dispute with the council over pay for workers in recycling and waste collection, street cleaning and parks maintenance, claiming they would be paid “just pennies over the national living wage”.

A union spokesperson said members were “considering a revised pay offer” but that strikes were “on the table” in the dispute.

In March, hundreds of workers at Aberdeen city council voted to back strike action to oppose a fire-and-rehire policy, as part of a dispute over a pay freeze and the implementation of a shorter working week.

GMB said 88% of its members in non-education roles and 71% of janitorial staff in the city’s schools backed the move.

In Sheffield, some bin workers have been on strike since last August in a dispute with their employer, Veolia, for their union to be recognised.

Earlier this year, there was uproar in Devon, where the county council tried to change working conditions for more than 800 staff through fire-and-rehire. After a protest from the GMB Union, new terms and conditions were agreed by both sides.

More than 100 refuse workers in Brighton voted in favour of industrial action over changes to normal working practices last year. This followed a 14-day strike in 2021, in which refuse collectors in the city successfully fought for a pay rise for low-paid workers.

Last year, Unite held industrial action ballots at 23 councils and two organisations run by councils after members rejected the local government pay offer, and although the pay offer was later agreed, the union said it would carry out localised walkouts in areas where it had obtained a mandate to strike.

Across the country councils are facing tough financial pressures. A recent survey of town hall leaders found that nearly two-thirds (63%) of councils were planning to reduce spending on services from April.

As the strike in Birmingham drags on and concerns grow over similar action elsewhere, there are increasing calls for ministers to intervene.

Graham criticised the government for taking “a huge amount of time to get involved in the dispute” between the union and Birmingham city council.

Sarah Jones, the government’s business and trade minister, urged Unite to accept the deal. “Our message loud and clear is Unite need to call off the strike, accept the deal, and let’s get back to normal, which is what people expect and what people deserve,” she told BBC Breakfast.

On Monday, Unite said its members in Birmingham voted overwhelmingly against what it described as a “totally inadequate” offer from the council. Further talks are planned for Wednesday.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/apr/15/birmingham-bin-strikes-could-spread-union-leader-warns,1
Nigel Farage says Reform UK is ‘parking its tanks’ on Labour’s lawn,"Nigel Farage has promised that Reform UK’s tanks are “on the lawns of the red wall” as he openly targeted Labour in a local elections speech heavy on Trump-like rhetoric but light on policy detail.

For his biggest set-piece event yet in a campaign in which his party hopes to win a slew of councillors in northern England and Midlands, Farage spoke at a working men’s club in County Durham – very deliberate symbolism in what was the Sedgefield constituency of Tony Blair.

“Reform are parking their tanks on the lawns of the red wall,” Farage told Reform activists and candidates in Newton Aycliffe. “Today is the first day I’ve said that, but I absolutely mean it, and we’re here, and we’re here to stay.

“If you are considering voting Conservative in these areas, you are wasting your vote, because if you want a party that can beat Labour, it is now very clearly Reform.”

Much of Farage’s speech was based on the idea that Reform UK had replaced Labour as the party of working people, and would reindustrialise declining regions with support for industries linked to steel and fossil fuels.

He cited polling produced for the party showing he was outperforming Keir Starmer in red-wall areas.

In another echo of Donald Trump, Farage littered his speech with culture war references, including a condemnation of recruitment policies that he said disadvantaged white people.

“We see recruitment policies in police forces, recruitment policies in the NHS, designed to put ethnic minorities to the top of the list against white people with more history in this country,” Farage said, calling the situation “a disgrace”.

He added: “We do not believe in DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] and that madness in any way at all, but it’s all part of the north London human rights lawyers being completely out of touch with ordinary folk.”

Condemning the “cultural decline” of the UK, Farage reiterated Reform’s intent to leave the European Convention on Human Rights and repeal the UK’s Human Rights Act, saying this would curb the influence of a “somewhat corrupted judiciary”.

Despite a cross-party Commons report this week dismissing the idea of “two-tier” policing during riots last summer, Farage repeated his claim that there had been “the most appalling cover-up” after the Southport killings that sparked the disorder.

Ignoring polls suggesting Trump was increasingly unpopular with UK voters, Farage made explicit references to the US president’s agenda, promising a “British equivalent of Doge” – Elon Musk’s department of government efficiency – in any councils won by Reform on 1 May.

In the speech and in a lengthy Q&A with reporters, Farage was vague about any specific policies, including how he would finance a repeal of the national insurance increase as well as changes to farm inheritance tax and the means-testing of winter fuel payments, all while raising the income tax threshold from £12,500 a year to £20,000.

Farage simply indicated that “the reindustrialisation of Britain” would “within a couple of years produce tens of thousands of well paid, in fact in many cases highly paid, jobs” that would boost growth. Extra money would also come from abolishing regulators and quangos “who do so much to stifle business”, he said.

Having backed the nationalisation of British Steel, Farage said a Reform government would aim to forge “a good partnership with the unions” – with the exception of teaching unions.

He said the National Education Union wanted to poison children’s minds “about everything to do with this country, its history, what it stood for and what it has fought for”.

He claimed union members were “telling kids that Reform is a racist party, Reform is a bad party, and kids that speak out against that face disciplinary action”.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/apr/15/nigel-farage-reform-is-parking-its-tanks-on-labours-lawn,1
Book bound in the skin of a 19th-century Suffolk murderer goes on display,"A second copy of a book bound in the skin of a notorious 19th-century murderer is now on display at a Suffolk museum.

However, Horrible Histories creator Terry Deary has told the Guardian that the volume is a “particularly sick” artefact which “shouldn’t be on display”.

William Corder was convicted of murdering his lover, Maria Marten, in what became known as the Red Barn Murder of 1827.

Corder was publicly executed the following year before being dissected. Some of his skin was used to bind a book about his trial which was passed to Moyse’s Hall Museum in Bury St Edmunds in the mid 1930s.

However, a second copy of the book – believed to feature Corder’s skin on its spine and corners – was discovered last year on a bookshelf of the museum’s office, and is now on display alongside the original book. The second copy is believed to have been donated around 20 years ago.

The case has spawned many film, radio and stage versions. “The murder continues to be interpreted and reinterpreted in popular culture to this day,” said Daniel Clarke, heritage officer at West Suffolk council.

“The facts have been blurred into near obscurity” with nearly 200 years of the tale’s retelling, states the museum’s website. Corder reportedly proposed meeting Marten at the Red Barn in Polstead, Suffolk, and eloping to Ipswich from there. He was later found guilty of murdering Marten at the barn.

Deary, whose books have sold tens of millions of copies, said that the conviction was based on circumstantial evidence, and that Corder is a “very misunderstood man”. The displayed skin-bound books are “very disrespectful to Corder’s memory”.

“I feel guilty because I have played Corder,” said Deary, who is also an actor. “I’ve got photographs of me threatening poor Maria Marten with a gun.”

Deary has written a novel due to be released next year – titled Actually, I’m a Corpse – based on this experience, in which the hero plays Corder before realising “how badly the poor man’s been maligned”. He said that he would like to “restore Corder’s reputation”.

Clarke said that the museum does not “deal with this as a salacious artefact but as a window into the past”. Items connected to the murder are positioned opposite a late 18th-century gibbet cage, used to display hanging corpses.

Together, the objects allow discussion and interpretation of the Bloody Code – laws that imposed the death penalty for many crimes – said Clarke.

“Do we think all books bound in skin should be on display? That would be debated on a case-by-case basis,” said Clarke. “In this instance, it is a stark and emotive set of artefacts that give us the chance to discuss the anatomising of the criminal corpse.

Starbucks’s UK retail business paid no corporation tax last year,"Starbucks’s UK retail business paid no corporation tax for last year as it dived to a £35m loss after paying £40m in royalty and licence fees to its parent company.

The US-owned coffee chain said it made the payments despite sales declining 4% to £525.6m in the year to 29 September 2024, amid what it called a “challenging economic climate” and a consumer boycott linked to the Gaza conflict.

Sales fell even though it opened 100 new British stores during the period. The previous year it had made a £16.9m pre-tax profit.

The company’s trading was hit after it was named on a list of companies to boycott for its perceived support for, investment in, or links to, Israel. It has denied having any political agenda, saying: “We do not use our profits to fund any government or military operations anywhere.”

In spite of sliding sales, Starbucks’s UK retail arm paid out just over £40m in royalty and licence fees to its parent company – a similar figure to the prior year – tipping it into loss so that it paid no corporation tax.

It did hand HM Revenue and Customs almost £1m in deferred payments and adjustments related to prior years – including £455,000 of corporation tax. That came after it was previously criticised by fair tax campaigners for paying a “derisorily low” £7.2m in UK corporation tax for 2023.

Paul Monaghan, the chief executive of the Fair Tax Foundation, described the catch-up payments as “paltry”, adding that the latest Starbucks UK accounts reflected a long history of paying little or no corporate income tax with “surpluses invariably wiped out by substantial royalty payments to other parts of the business”.

Starbucks paid just £8.6m in the first 14 years after its 1998 debut in the UK, with none paid in several consecutive years, despite £3bn worth of sales during that time.

A Starbucks spokesperson said:“Starbucks is in full compliance with tax laws around the world, with an effective global tax rate of over 24% in 2024, which is in excess of the 15% minimum corporation tax discussed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.”

The number of transactions at Starbucks’s 1,240 UK outlets, which include 378 run directly by the company as well as hundreds operated by franchisees, fell back as it raised prices by up to 4% on its drinks, amid inflation on coffee beans, cocoa and milk. The price of a latte or cappuccino hit £4.25 in March last year, with more elaborate drinks, such as a white chocolate mocha, reaching £5.40.

This month prices have risen again, with a cappuccino now costing £4.70 and a caramel macchiato priced at £6.10.

As the company fell into the red, Starbucks’s parent company pumped £50m into its UK division last year – via a revolving credit facility and a capital injection. Late last year the parent group committed to support its UK arm further financially if necessary and extended the payback period for a £20m loan, on which it is charging its UK business more than 5% interest, until December this year.

“Persistent inflation and higher interest rates left consumers with less disposable income, resulting in many adjusting usual spending habits; leading to a reduction in year-on-year transactions,” Starbucks said in accounts filed at Companies House this week.

“This was coupled with an increasingly competitive environment in key cities as new entrants to the market invested in new stores. Misperceptions about the brand relating to events in the Middle East also affected footfall in some locations in the first half of the year.”

The company, which was founded in Seattle in 1971 and is now the world’s biggest coffee shop operator, said there was also increasing competition for the best sites in city centres and drive-thrus, despite coffee shops coming under pressure from cost inflation and tightened consumer spending.

While Starbucks’s UK business has struggled, its cheaper rival Greggs has been rapidly expanding, while the British chain Caffè Nero increased sales globally by 15% in the year to May 2024 to almost £520m, including 10% growth in the UK. However, Caffè Nero also fell into the red, recording a £34.4m annual loss.

X’s UK profits collapsed the year after Elon Musk’s takeover,"X’s revenues and profits collapsed in the UK in the year after Elon Musk took over the social media platform, the company has admitted.

A decline in advertising spending amid concerns about “brand safety and/or content moderation” were cited as the reason for the fall, according to accounts filed this week to Companies House.

Twitter UK Ltd also narrowly averted being struck off last month for failing to file the accounts on time, according to other recent filings to Companies House. It only filed full accounts on Monday for 2023, the year in which it was rebranded as X after Musk’s takeover.

“The business continues to take corrective measures to build brand safety tools, invest in platform safety and content moderation and then educate advertisers about these initiatives,” the company said.

Its overall revenue totalled £69.1m, down from £205.3m in 2022, a decrease of 66.3% year-on-year. The profit for 2023 dropped from £5.6m the previous year to £1.2m. Pre-tax profits were 74% lower at £2.25 million. This was a “significant decrease in the performance of the company”, it said.

Musk’s takeover also led to a wave of sackings, with the billionaire telling the BBC in 2023 that only 1,500 of about 8,000 Twitter employees were still employed at the company in that year.

In the UK, the accounts show that the number of the company’s employees fell to 114, from 399 the previous year. This included a cut of 173 to the number employed in “research and development”.

Despite its struggles, the value of X soared back earlier this year to the $44bn Musk paid for it and last month his X.AI artificial intelligence firm acquired the business for $33bn.

Farhad Divecha, a digital advertising expert who is chief executive of AccuraCast and founder of Unyte.AI, said he was not surprised at what the figures revealed.

“The indicators have been there all along,” he said. “If anything, I think we’ve seen the worst and X might finally have the chance to recover advertiser revenues, but that’s only going to happen in UK and Europe if Musk and his crew pull their act together, provide support for advertisers and put in place some brand safety guardrails.”

X has been approached for comment, as has Kin Fai Cheung, whose name is listed as the director who signed off on the accounts. Cheung and Adeeb Sahar are listed as the company’s directors although Musk is recorded at Companies House as the person with “significant control”.

Musk set up a new company in the UK at the end of last year amid speculation that he was planning to make a large donation to Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party.

The company, called X.AI London, was incorporated on 12 December. It was recorded as being engaged in “business and domestic software development” and is based at the same London offices as X.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/15/x-twitter-profits-uk-collapsed-year-after-elon-musk-took-over,1
"People of Huddersfield raise £15,000 to return boy’s body to his parents in Syria","The body of a 16-year-old refugee who died after being stabbed in Huddersfield is being returned to his parents in Syria after local people raised more than £15,000 for his repatriation.

Ahmad Mamdouh Al Ibrahim, described by his family as “a very nice boy” who wanted to be a doctor, was stabbed in the neck on the afternoon of 3 April while being shown around the town centre by his cousin.

It was only the second time he had been there, after arriving in Huddersfield two weeks earlier from an immigration centre in Wales, and spending Ramadan with his uncle’s family.

He was pictured a few days before his death smiling and laughing with his younger cousins during Eid al-Fitr in images shown to the Guardian by his uncle, who did not want to be named.

Alfie Franco, 20, of Kirkburton near Huddersfield, appeared in court two days after the killing charged with murder and was remanded in custody until a further hearing in May.

Ahmad’s funeral prayers were held at Huddersfield’s Omar mosque on Friday.

Maneer Siddique, who set up a fundraising campaign to help the family – who he did not previously know – in the aftermath of Ahmad’s death, estimated that about 500 people attended the service.

Ahmad’s body will be flown from Heathrow to Damascus on Tuesday evening, accompanied by two relatives. From there, they will travel to Ahmad’s family in the city of Homs, where in his younger years he had been injured by bomb shrapnel during the war he was fleeing when he came to the UK.

Ahmad knew no one in Huddersfield apart from his family, who he was living with, his uncle previously told the Guardian.

He said: “He was trying to make a friend, because he didn’t have friends here. I said to him, you have to go out into the town centre to know [where everything is], to know where you can go shopping … plus, you’re going to make friends.”

Cards left at the scene in the week after Ahmad was killed carried heartfelt messages addressed to “the lad I don’t know”, some of them signed simply from “a stranger” and the “heartbroken Huddersfield people”.

Siddique said he had been “absolutely overwhelmed” by the response from the people of Huddersfield, having initially only hoped to raise £2,000. The GoFundMe page to pay for the funeral and repatriation expenses surpassed £15,000 on Tuesday and continues to rise. “To generate that kind of money in such a short space of time is unreal,” he said.

He said people had also been dropping by the tailoring business he runs to make cash donations. One man brought in an envelope which Siddique passed on to Ahmad’s uncle. “He started counting the money and there was £500 in the envelope. He was in tears,” he said.

“He really wants to thank everyone. And I would like to also thank people personally because of the amount of money we’ve generated through people’s kindness.”

A second funeral will be held this week for Ahmad in Homs, where he will be buried.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/15/body-of-huddersfield-refugee-boy-ahmad-mamdouh-al-ibrahim--to-be-repatriated-to-parents-in-syria,1
"Little sign that tax rise for employers will mean mass job losses, data shows","The UK jobs market continues to cool but Rachel Reeves will be relieved that there is little sign as yet in the latest data that her tax increase on employers is leading to mass job losses.

Targeting employer national insurance contributions (NICs) to raise an extra £25bn in October’s budget sparked a furious business backlash and dire warnings about the impact for workers.

So far there is little sign of a dramatic shakeout – but the labour market slowdown that began last year has continued.

The number of vacancies across the economy, which peaked at 1.3m in early 2022, has now been declining for 33 quarters, and at 781,000 has slipped below the pre-pandemic level.

According to the ONS’s (admittedly unreliable) labour force survey (LFS), unemployment was unchanged for the quarter, at 4.4% – again, similar to the pre-pandemic level. The employment rate rose modestly, to 75.1%.

The number of employees firms have on their payrolls – measured using tax data, and so not subject to the same doubts as the LFS – declined by an unusually large 78,000 in March; but the ONS itself put that in perspective, saying, “the number of payrolled employees shows little change since January 2024”.

This continued softening does point to a slowdown then, but appears to belie some of the more catastrophic warnings about the impact of the NICs rise, which is being implemented alongside a significant 7% increase in the statutory “national living wage”.

The higher tax burden for employers may yet continue to weigh on demand for workers in the coming months, but henceforward it will become increasingly difficult to isolate it from the impact of the looming global slowdown that is likely to result from Donald Trump’s tariff policies.

February’s better than expected GDP data may also soon look like a snapshot of the state of the economy before the storm unleashed by Washington.

The UK may yet strike an agreement for the 10% levy on all exports to the US to be lifted – potentially in exchange for concessions such as tax cuts for global tech firms.

But as Reeves herself has been clear, it will be impossible to shelter the UK from the knock on effects of slower global growth, as the tariffs take hold.

The Bank of England, which still has interest rates set to curb inflation, rather than boost waning growth, will have to weigh the risks of such a downturn against the continued strength of wage growth, which makes rate-setters anxious.

The ONS said total pay, including bonuses, increased by 5.6% in three months to February, significantly higher than the Bank’s monetary policy committee is likely to be comfortable with.

But as exporters prepare to contend with the impact of the rollercoaster tariff policy, this latest set of data may rapidly come to look like a snapshot of the state of the jobs market before, as Rachel Reeves has repeatedly said, the world changed.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/15/little-sign-that-tax-rise-for-employers-will-mean-mass-job-losses-data-shows,1
"Trump tariffs will mean world uses less oil this year, IEA says","The world will use less crude oil than expected this year due the “substantial risks” posed by Donald Trump’s trade tariffs to the global economy, according to the global energy watchdog.

The International Energy Agency slashed its forecasts for global oil demand growth by a third for the year ahead, and warned that it could make further downward revisions depending on whether a trade war develops.

The Paris-based agency had previously forecast that the world’s appetite for crude, which is a key economic indicator, would rise by 1.03m barrels a day this year to a record high.

But after Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs on global trade it has cut its forecast growth to 730,000 barrels a day. Oil demand growth could slow further next year to 690,000 barrels a day due to “the weaker economic environment”, it said.

“While imports of oil, gas and refined products were given exemptions from the tariffs announced by the United States, concerns that the measures could stoke inflation, slow economic growth and intensify trade disputes weighed on oil prices,” the agency said.

The benchmark price for oil fell from almost $75 a barrel to four-year lows of below $60 a barrel in under a week after Trump set out a swathe of global tariffs on trade, including particularly punitive rates for Chinese goods.

Oil prices have reclaimed some ground, to about $65 (£49) on Tuesday, after Trump paused some of the tariffs for 90 days, pending negotiations. But fears over a global economic slowdown have remained, keeping an oil market recovery in check.

Big banks have revised down their forecasts for the oil price to account for a potential global economic recession. The Swiss bank UBS cut its price forecast by $12 a barrel to $68 a barrel for this year while Goldman Sachs said it expected the benchmark crude price to average $63 a barrel this year, and fall further to $58 next year.

The IEA warned that the falling oil market prices triggered by Trump’s trade tariffs were likely to upend his own election promise to expand the country’s oil and gas industry by urging producers to “drill, baby, drill”.

US shale producers need global market prices of at least $65 a barrel to drill new shale oil wells and make a profit, according to the IEA, and the industry could now also face higher costs on importing steel and drilling equipment as a result of the tariffs.

The agency has revised down its forecasts for US oil production growth this year by 150,000 barrels a day to 490,000 barrels a day. Meanwhile, the countries which make up the Opec oil cartel and their allies have said they will increase their collective oil production by 411,000 barrels a day – although the increase may be smaller in reality because some countries are already exceeding their quotas.

The IEA warned that risks to its forecasts “remain rife given the fast-moving macro backdrop”.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/15/trump-tariffs-will-mean-world-uses-less-oil-2025-iea,1
Italian police arrest 24 suspected mafiosi over Naples parking protection racket,"Italian police have arrested 24 suspected members of the Camorra – the notorious Neapolitan mafia – on charges of drug trafficking, arms possession and running an illegal parking attendant scheme.

According to investigators, several of those arrested on Monday were reportedly affiliated with well-known Camorra families operating in the Fuorigrotta and Chiaia districts of Naples. Some were already serving jail sentences.

Investigators said the Troncone and Frizziero clans, in addition to involvement in the drug trade and cigarette smuggling, were behind a parking scheme in which drivers felt compelled by “attendants” to pay extra fees in order to ensure their vehicles remained untouched when parked.

The practice is widespread in southern Italy and, according to a report by the Greens and Left Alliance political grouping, there are approximately 2,400 illegal parking attendants operating in Naples alone. Many of them are thought to be affiliated with Camorra clans, and the illicit trade allegedly generates more than €100m (£86m) a year.

In other areas, unauthorised attendants are forced to pay protection money to mobsters in order to be allowed to operate within territories controlled by the mafia.

“Illegal parking attendants essentially demand a protection fee, a pizzo, from drivers,” said Francesco Emilio Borrelli, an MP for the Greens and Left Alliance.

“They even ask you to pay when you park in areas that are already marked for payment. If you refuse, you are threatened, your car can be damaged or, even worse, you can be physically assaulted.”

Borrelli himself has been beaten and threatened on several occasions by illegal attendants in Naples. In one instance, he says, they even attempted to run him over with a car.

Borrelli said the problem was that, under the law, acting as an unauthorised parking attendant was not considered a criminal offence. “Offenders merely receive a token fine,” he added. “If we don’t change the law, these clans will continue to exploit citizens for their own profit.”

Apple airlifted iPhones worth $2bn from India in March as Trump tariffs loomed,"Apple’s main Indian suppliers Foxconn and Tata shipped nearly $2bn worth of iPhones to the United States in March, an all-time high, as the US company airlifted devices to bypass Donald Trump’s impending tariffs, customs data shows.

The smartphone maker stepped up production in India and chartered cargo flights to ferry 600 tons of iPhones to the United States to ensure sufficient inventory in one of its biggest markets based on concern that the US president’s tariffs would push up costs. At least six cargo jets were used in the operation, which one source described as a way to “beat the tariffs”.

In April, the US administration imposed 26% duties on imports from India, much lower than the more than 100% China was facing at the time. Trump has since paused most duties, except for those on China, for three months.

Foxconn, Apple’s main India supplier, exported smartphones worth $1.31bn in March, its highest ever for a single month, equal to shipments for January and February combined, according to commercially available customs data reviewed by Reuters. This included Apple iPhone 13, 14, 16 and 16e models, and took Foxconn’s total shipments from India to the United States this year to $5.3bn.

Exports from Tata Electronics, another Apple supplier, stood at $612m in March, about 63% higher than the previous month, and included iPhone 15 and 16 models. Apple, Foxconn and Tata did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Customs data showed all Foxconn shipments to the US in March were by air from the Chennai Air Cargo terminal, and landed at various locations, including Los Angeles and New York, with Chicago receiving the majority.

In April, after the flights of phones took off from Chennai, Trump granted exclusions from steep tariffs on smartphones and some other electronics imported largely from China, but later indicated that those exemptions will probably be short-lived.

To expedite shipments, Apple lobbied Indian airport authorities to cut the time needed to clear customs at Chennai airport in the southern state of Tamil Nadu to six hours, down from 30.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/15/iphone-apple-india-tariffs,1
"Coachella 2025 highlights: a sweaty, star-packed year with thrills for all ages","Despite its reputation for bohemian escape – a music Disneyland for adults in the desert – Coachella can often feel like a gauntlet. The drive from Los Angeles to Indio will set you back anywhere from three to five hours, the lines even more; some campers endured 12-hour lines to access the site.

A three-day general admissions pass went for a whopping $649 this year, $220 more than just five years ago, and that’s not counting money spent on lodging, food and outfits suitable for temp swings of 40F. No wonder over half of attendees this year were on payment plans. Unless Revolve is footing your bill, what 20-something can afford Coachella?

Such was the latest strain of bad press for North America’s largest music festival, which – depending on who you talk to – is recovering from its flop year of depressed ticket sales in 2024. Whether the inflammatory headlines comparing it to Fyre Festival (wrong) or questioning gen Z’s financial literacy (fair) are out of genuine concern or Fomo-laced schadenfreude, Coachella is certainly in some form of identity shift, with the question of who it’s for, who attends and what it represents in palpable flux over the course of its first 2025 weekend.

On the one hand, the festival draws a more international lineup and diverse crowd than its flower-crown reputation suggests; though it of course skews young, there were plenty of middle-aged adults (with, presumably, more robust bank accounts) mixed in with high schoolers, gaggles of shirtless men, college kids on drugs and the occasional baby with headphones on. On the other, well, it’s hard to walk more than a few feet in the rapidly browning grass without either interrupting a photo or being asked to take one, the festival’s appearance-oriented clientele still hopelessly tied to the ‘gram and the game of envy.

But those who did make it were rewarded by solid sets and deep dehydration – temperatures reached a scorching 102F (39C) on Friday, making 2025 the hottest festival on record. “It’s hottttttttt … but it’s nice” rasped Djo, AKA Stranger Things’ Joe Keery, on Friday afternoon in a sweltering Mojave cool kids’ tent, attendees bopping to chill songs of existential ennui and anxiety while sweating through their shirts.

“The weather’s not like this in England, I can tell you that,” lamented a miserable looking beabadoobee in the Sunday glare; the Filipino-British singer nonetheless turned out a winsome set of alt-rock shredding that recalled both Liz Phair and Michelle Branch.

Good luck to anyone performing before 7pm, though the heat lent the whole affair a sense of survivors’ bonding – the sight of drummer Tré Cool sweating off his glitter eye shadow during Green Day’s Saturday night set, long after the sun went down, was perhaps the most representative image of a weekend that had many melting face.

Rising temps met simmering discontent. Recession indicators abounded, from screaming to Green Day’s American Idiot (“I’m not part of a Maga agenda,” singer Billie Joe Armstrong ad-libbed), to Jimmy Eat World drenching the main stage in sweat and what is now dad rock, to Charli xcx’s unofficial headliner set of pure indie sleaze. Brat green outpaced crochet on Saturday, with the British artist drawing one of the biggest crowds of the weekend to watch her stunt through bangers only with Billie Eilish, Lorde and Troye Sivan, along with numerous celebrity fans; videos circulated of Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner canoodling in the VIP area. Jenner’s ex Travis Scott served as the semi-billed fourth headliner of the weekend, with a late Saturday set that several people I met planned to cautiously attend, citing fears about the Astroworld disaster that went unmentioned. Styled as a modern-day gladiator, attacking the beat while nearly obscured by smoke, Scott’s set projected aggression without incident.

Like last year, female artists saved Coachella from flopping, providing some of the biggest highs of the weekend. Charli’s party-girl energy gave way to party politics, with Clairo bringing out Bernie Sanders, fresh off a Fighting Oligarchy rally in LA, as a surprise guest. Sanders called on a queer-leaning gen Z crowd to “lead in the fight to combat climate change, protect women’s rights, and build an economy that works for all, not just the few” – at a festival whose CEO has donated extensively to Republican campaigns and anti-LGBTQ+ organizations. The Go-Go’s kicked off the festival with a set celebrating their 40+ years as punk leaders, proving youth is a mindset. And Lady Gaga’s instantly canonical set was worth the price of admission alone, once again demonstrating Coachella’s long transition into a major pop star festival in the wake of Beychella. I left my body at the sight of Gaga, haughty in queenly garb, transitioning from 2025 smash Abracadabra to 2011 hit Judas from on high.

A year after Chappell Roan rocketed into the mainstream from the small Gobi stage, the South African star Tyla appeared ascendant on the Outdoor stage, holding the crowd’s focus with some of the loosest hips I’ve ever seen. The popheads then hustled across the grounds to Lisa – AKA Blackpink’s Lalisa Manobal – at Sahara, where she cemented her solo career with a slickly produced, eardrum-puncturing set that recalled Blackpink’s maximally hype headlining appearance two years ago. Her bandmate Jennie put an exclamation point on K-Pop’s inroads at Coachella on Sunday, all crisp choreography and heavy beats with a cowboy hat.

Megan Thee Stallion, too, went cowgirl with boots, hat and leather for indisputably the hottest dancing of the weekend. Her set delivered some of the heaviest nostalgia hits as well – during Plan B, she brought out Queen Latifah to perform U.N.I.T.Y, her 1993 track also confronting disrespect of women’s bodies and choices, and Ciara to twerk for Goodies. Both incited massive crowd freak-outs, only slightly dampened by the festival cutting Megan’s mic for time. And Missy Elliott melted time for her festival debut with a set that, a few technical issues aside, appealed to the past and the future at once; Get Ur Freak On and bug glasses have confirmed made it to gen Z.

Nostalgia, of course, powered a good portion of a festival that depends as much on drawing the veterans as the festival bros tripping at Sahara.

“As an old person I love to see how much love these old bands are getting,” said a woman who appeared to be (gasp) 35 at an over-capacity crowd for Weezer’s Saturday set. Basement Jaxx and Kraftwerk, both running far behind schedule at an otherwise typically tight festival, reminded why they’ve long been on the Coachella lineup, back when the festival skewed heavily rock and electronic. T-Pain took attendees back to 2007 with an electrified version of Buy U a Drank that made walking through the crowd a battle against flailing limbs. Zedd portaled to 2013 with an extended version of Clarity, the high point of millennial-leaning set that brought out Maren Morris, John Mayer and Julia Michaels. Benson Boone, 22, explicitly channeling Freddie Mercury, brought out the 77-year-old Queen guitarist Brian May for Bohemian Rhapsody. And Post Malone and Shaboozey leaned into the nostalgia inherent in a country twang; the latter’s voice, rich and honeyed, drew a strikingly diverse crowd for a full sing-along to A Bar Song (Tipsy), which he premiered at Coachella last year to far fewer people.

For a festival that often feels too slick for its own good, there were still some surprises. The little monsters of erstwhile Nickelodeon kids’ show Yo Gabba Gabba! delivered one of the most unexpectedly joyous and strange hours of the weekend – pure mascot mayhem, Duolingo owl included, for silly songs like Yummy In My Tummy, plus Weird Al and Flavor Flav for a ridiculously catchy number called I Love Bugs. That moment, vibing out to children’s song about centipedes and spiders, unlocked the secret of Coachella – find whatever escape hits enough to forget the enormous start-up costs and tiers of people getting better access than you, and it’s all worth it. That it took a children’s show performing to a room at least 50% on drugs to find it is as good an indicator as any that Coachella is in its quarter-life crisis era, trying a little of everything, cartoon monsters to Little Monsters, to see what sticks.",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/apr/15/coachella-2025-stars-megan-thee-stallion-queen-latifah,1
"‘His delivery cut through class barriers’: Moby, Mala and other musicians on working with Benjamin Zephaniah","Tuesday marks the 67th birthday of the late Benjamin Zephaniah – revolutionary poet, playwright, musician and fearless voice for social justice – following the inaugural Benjamin Zephaniah Day held over the weekend at Brunel University. But while he is widely celebrated for his work in literature and activism, Zephaniah’s influence on music remains relatively overlooked.

Emerging from the dub poetry scene, Zephaniah channelled personal experiences of systemic racism and state violence into intelligent spoken word. Albums such as Rasta combined politically charged poetry with dub rhythms and studio effects, laying the cultural groundwork for UK genres such as trip-hop, jungle and dubstep. We revisit his unique collaborations in electronic music, hearing from the artists who had the honour of working with him.

Natty x Mala x Benjamin Zephaniah – Word & Sound (2019)

Zephaniah’s Rastafari-inspired wisdom, Natty’s roots-infused minimalism and Mala’s DMZ-era dubstep combine to raise the consciousness vibration in Word & Sound – an uplifting, intergenerational union years in the making. “Benjamin was like an older brother to me, we were sometimes on the phone for hours,” Natty says. “So when I asked him to be part of a project I was doing, he wrote his verse immediately.” They recorded at Akala’s Ladbroke Grove studio in London then spent hours listening to Zephaniah’s stories – including his rightous refusal of an MBE.

Natty says the vocals were meant for the track Badman (Rastafari mix), but when Mala reached out, the dubstep producer was sent them instead. “Working with such powerful voices was something else,” says Mala. “Their words guided my creative process. Benjamin’s verse is a reminder to stay true and keep growing in heart and spirit. Rest in peace, sir, we salute you.”

Natty continues to include the track in his live sets in memory of his friend. “Whenever we met, we’d sometimes spar, as we both studied martial arts. I remember how strong he was, which made his passing even harder to accept. He was just a down-to-earth, brilliant human being. I’m so grateful to have known and learned from him.”

Kofi Stone – May Sound Crazy (ft Benjamin Zepheniah) (2024)

Born-and-bred Brummies Kofi Stone and Zephaniah are a force to be reckoned with in this collaboration – one of Zephaniah’s last, recorded in summer 2023. He steps into the resilient role of mentor in this ambient electronic-infused hip-hop track, as Stone reflects on growing up in Birmingham and navigating poverty and racism. “It was truly an experience I’ll never forget,” Stone says.

Ahead of the recording, Stone met Zephaniah outside the Birmingham Hippodrome, where he was narrating the Peaky Blinders ballet. “Before the show, we spoke at length about family, music and the state of the world,” recalls Stone. “He later drove us to the studio and recorded his verse in just a few takes. The whole process was surreal and beautiful.”

The video to the track was produced months later. “Benjamin was actually quite unwell at the time,” says Stone, “but he was determined to make the shoot. We filmed his scene on a rooftop car park in Birmingham’s Chinatown.” That was [another] day I’ll never forget.”

Bomb the Bass – Empire (with Sinéad O’Connor & Benjamin Zephaniah) (1995)

Zephaniah joined Bomb the Bass and Sinéad O’Connor to deliver a critique of colonialism in this trip-hop-influenced production, imagining a life-sucking vampire as a metaphor for empire. Tim Simenon, AKA Bomb the Bass, says: “I remember smoking a lot of weed with Sinéad while recording Empire. She sang the lead vocal in one take, then added harmonies and backing vocals.”

Simenon instinctively knew that Zephaniah’s voice would contrast powerfully. “He was such a warm, open guy. We spent a long day in the studio, bouncing ideas around until we landed on the spacious delivery we recorded. He gave the final mix an approving head nod – he was super pleased with the result. We mostly spoke about music, especially dub. We shared a love for Big Youth, Lee ‘Scratch’ Perry and On-U Sound.”

LB Dub Corp: I Have a Dream (ft Benjamin Zephaniah) (2013)

I Have a Dream pairs Zephaniah’s cheeky twist on Martin Luther King’s iconic speech with atmospheric dub techno. It’s one of two tracks featuring him on Luke Slater’s LB Dub Corp album Unknown Origin, the other being Take a Ride. “When I reached out about combining a track with his poem I Have a Scheme, he was up for it straight away,” Slater says. “We somehow ended up debating vegan food in China.”

Reflecting on their final exchange, Slater said: “Benjamin had just received the album copies I sent and told me he played the track for his students. I was humbled. I miss him in this dimension, but his words live on.” He had intended to ask him to collaborate a second time. “Then a week later he was gone. He left too soon. His words always carried a message – not always comfortable, never bland. His delivery cut through class barriers and reached people from all walks of life.”

Swayzak – Illegal (ft Benjamin Zephaniah) (2000)

The duo Swayzak captured Zephaniah’s rebellious spirit in this unapologetically anarchic track. “Working with Benjamin was an unexpected delight,” says James S Taylor. “There was no ego, no pressure, just good vibes.” The collaboration quickly grew into a friendship. “We talked deeply about politics and the British empire,” David Brown says. “The Brummie West Indian poet – quite a person to have in one’s life.”

A 2024 “redraft” of Zephaniah’s 1999 poem Illegal was released under the title Do Something Illegal as a tribute to Zephaniah under Brown’s ambient alias, the Eightsome Reel. The track ends with the sound of heavy rain, recorded the day Brown learned of Zephaniah’s death. “It hit me hard – I was in East Kilbride when I heard, a place where he once lived.”

Moby – Where is Your Pride (ft Benjamin Zephaniah) (2024)

Released in June 2024 as part of his album, Always Centered at Night, Moby’s Where Is Your Pride? is a tribute to Zephaniah. He says: “As a vegan activist and as a wise and compassionate man, Benjamin inspired me for many years. I hope Where Is Your Pride? honours his legacy and also draws people’s attention to his life, work and principles.”",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/apr/15/his-delivery-cut-through-class-barriers-moby-mala-and-other-musicians-on-working-with-benjamin-zephaniah,1
"BCMG/Yamada review – flutter tonguing, fragrant dissonances and frogs","In the foyer, a family workshop was in full swing. A huddle of under-12s listened intently to Japan-born, Britain-based composer Dai Fujikura. Several delighted non-children sidled up to tuned percussion instruments laid out on a table. There were instructions and paper for making an origami frog.

These were cheery attempts to contextualise BCMG’s programme: an all-Japanese first half by Misato Mochizuki and Fujikura – including the world premiere of the latter’s new Shō Concerto – followed by Korean composer Unsuk Chin’s Xi for Ensemble and Tape. But hold fire on the east-meets-west cliches. Fujikura moved to the UK aged 15 and first encountered the shō at Darmstadt in his 20s. As he explained in a pre-concert talk, Japanese instruments are all “new” to him.

The shō sounds like a tiny organ with 17 bamboo “pipes”. In Fujikura’s concerto, the bright, laser-intense timbre of soloist Yuki Deai was the trigger for orchestral pitch- and tone-matching, sounds passed from shō to violins and upper woodwind. Just occasionally, the orchestra responded with a rich, bass-weighted roar or a full-voiced chord. The shō mostly layered notes in delicate clusters (the dissonances never more than fragrant) while passages of flutter tonguing and a driving rhythmic tattoo provided contrast. Under conductor Kazuki Yamada, the effect was beautiful, if rather amorphous.

Even Fujikura seemed surprised that BCMG had programmed An Anthem (2020), his arrangement of the Japanese national anthem for a long-ago cancelled event, though the musicians took care with its airy orchestration. The UK premiere of Mochizuki’s Etheric Blueprint (2006) was more persuasive. From a sample of water dripping, it developed into a beguiling compendium of analogue and electronic sounds, many quietly intricate (think ASMR avant la lettre).

Chin’s Xi was radical when new in 1998, combining tape and live musicians to explore the territory between “noise” and pitch. Today, the work’s use of spatial audio (clicks and clanks, breaths and patters sliding between six speakers) remains immersive. But in this performance, driven by conductor Nicolò Foron in a distracting slow-motion robotic dance, its relentless bittiness felt like the “new music” of another age: distant beyond geography.",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/apr/15/bcmg-yamada-review-cbso-centre-birmingham,1
‘I’m giving up’: Cate Blanchett says she is retiring from acting,"Cate Blanchett says that she is “giving up” acting to do other things “with [her] life”.

In an interview with Radio Times, Blanchett suggested she was uncertain over calling herself an “actress”, saying: “It’s because I’m giving up.”

She added: “My family roll their eyes every time I say it, but I mean it. I am serious about giving up acting … [There are] a lot of things I want to do with my life”.

Blanchett was speaking as BBC Radio 4 prepared to air her first major radio play, an adaptation of Wallace Shawn’s play The Fever about a woman who undergoes a political and spiritual awakening. Blanchett has just completed a five-week run on stage as Arkadina in Chekhov’s The Seagull at London’s Barbican theatre, and her most recent major film role, opposite Michael Fassbender as a married spy in the Steven Soderbergh-directed thiller Black Bag, was released in March.

Blanchett has won numerous awards for her acting, including two Oscars (best actress for Blue Jasmine in 2014 and best supporting actress for The Aviator in 2005) and two best actress awards at the Venice film festival (for I’m Not There in 2007 and Tár in 2022).

She recently finished working on a new film directed by Jim Jarmusch, Father, Mother, Sister, Brother, which is due for release in 2025 (though was surprisingly omitted from the recent announcement of the lineup for the Cannes film festival), and is currently working on Alpha Gang, a sci-fi comedy directed by David and Nathan Zellner, as both actor and producer. She is also attached (again as both actor and producer) through her production company Dirty Films to The Champions, a film to be directed by Ben Stiller.

Despite her high levels of activity, Blanchett says in the interview that she is uncomfortable with her position as a celebrity actor.

“I’ve always felt like I’m on the periphery of things, so I’m always surprised when I belong anywhere. I go with curiosity into whatever environment that I’m in, not expecting to be accepted or welcomed. I’ve spent a lifetime getting comfortable with the feeling of being uncomfortable.”

She added: “No one is more boring to me than myself and I find other people much more interesting. I find myself profoundly dull.”",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/apr/15/cate-blanchett-retiring-from-acting,1
‘Charisma in abundance’: why Just Act Normal is the best showcase for new talent since Adolescence,"Over the last few years, we have found ourselves inundated with sadcoms. Again and again, we’ve been deluged by ostensible comedies that are so concerned with grief and trauma that the laughs end up feeling like a distant afterthought. Striking the right balance between comedy and drama takes absurd levels of effort and craft at the best of times. Doing it with a premise as bleak as BBC Three’s new series Just Act Normal is almost impossible.

My hands are tied with embargos, so I have to be vague about certain plot details, but Just Act Normal is a show about three young siblings who decide to struggle on as normal after their mother – a perennially unreliable woman with substance abuse issues – disappears. Their lives are suddenly spent trying to navigate the complex systems of the adult world while processing the grief of abandonment in real time. Sounds like grim stuff (Disney’s Good American Family recently tackled a similar subject in the form of full-blown melodrama), and yet there’s a palpable lightness of touch to Just Act Normal. You could almost call it joy.

“We were always, like, ‘This is a warped fairytale,’” says director Nathaniel Martello-White of the show’s complicated tonal balance, as we talk on Zoom. “The kind of comedy and drama in the series reminds me of the way that fairytales swing from extreme moments of joy to intense moments of pain and destruction. So I’d always tell these guys to try to find those kinds of archetypes and references for the characters.”

“These guys” are Akins Subair and Chenée Taylor (also present on the Zoom) who play Tionne and Tiana, two of the siblings who suddenly find themselves alone in the world. Janice Okoh adapted Just Act Normal from her 2013 play Three Birds, and to say that the play left these youngsters with big shoes to fill is a woeful understatement. Taylor’s part, for instance, was initially played by Michaela Coel.

“I wasn’t familiar with it,” Taylor says of the play. “I didn’t try to find it to watch, either, just because I didn’t want it to influence my performance in any way.” On following a presence as large as Coel’s, she says: “It scared me for a second. But then I thought about it and said, ‘No, it doesn’t scare me.’ They’re two different things, the play and the series, do you know what I mean?”

Subair had even less familiarity with the material, only auditioning the weekend before filming began. “I got the job on Friday, and I was going to a football game on the Sunday, so I just had the Saturday to familiarise myself with the entire script and get everything cemented in my head.” Subair is a Londoner and Shaheen Baig, the show’s casting director, sent him a YouTube video of the West Midlands dialect he needed to master. “But as you can imagine, with all of it happening so abruptly, I didn’t really have time to go over the YouTube video countless times,” he says.

What’s remarkable about this is that you completely buy Taylor and Subair (and Kaydrah Walker-Willkie, who rounds out the trio as younger sister Tanika) as siblings. They enmeshed at speed, according to Taylor, over a series of Nando’s dinners, and the result is a comprehensive portrait of a group of people struggling through a painful experience.

You could call it loss, but that isn’t quite the word for what they go through. “Their mother is a functioning addict,” says Martello-White. “The reason why these three children have this resilience is that, although their mum loved them, they’ve also been managing that aspect of their lives. When Tianna steps up as the surrogate mother of the family, she’s been playing that role for the last four or five years.”

As well as Okoh’s script, Martello-White credits the successful balance of comedy and drama to the casting. “While it was a very, very important, serious subject matter, it was being dealt with in this quite mischievous, playful way,” he says. “The process became about finding actors who can deliver that flavour. I was looking for people who have this kind of charisma and authenticity, which these two have in abundance.”

Both Subair and Taylor are television newcomers. “Nobody in my family is from the industry,” reveals Taylor, a Birmingham native. “I moved to London when I was 18, so I could go to a part-time drama school, and work part-time. I really hustled. I worked in a bar, I worked in a theatre. When you tell people you want to be an actor, they all say ‘Oh, go and work in a theatre, you can make connections.’ That is not what I did. I served drinks and I took people to their seats.”

“Similar to Chenée, I didn’t go to drama school,” adds Subair. “I actually studied economics. But acting has always been plan A for me. Once I graduated, I went to a drama school spinoff called Hackney Showroom, which essentially provides opportunities for people of working-class backgrounds who may not have had the opportunity to go to these prestigious schools such as Rada or Lamda.”

View image in fullscreen Fantastic … Sam Buchanan and Jamelia in Just Act Normal. Photograph: Ben Gregory-Ring/BBC/The Forge

The cast is rounded out by an impressive list of heavy hitters. Romola Garai plays a teacher caught between concern and self-interest. Back to Black’s Sam Buchanan does a fantastic job confounding the trope of the estate drug dealer. Ivanno Jeremiah is heartbreaking as the children’s estranged father. And then there is Jamelia (most recent screen credit: Celebs Go Dating), who damn near steals the show as a kind of maternal stand-in figure.

“She’s very funny,” laughs Martello-White. “Just for that role, I wanted to do something meta and cast a musician as a Tina Turner impersonator. Obviously Jamelia is a Brummie, and she’s an incredible musician, so it was kind of, ‘Oh, let’s see what Jamelia is doing.’ And she really wanted to start getting into more comedy and premium TV, so all those things aligned. I’m really glad it worked out, because she’s just got so much in front of the camera. Again, it’s a very serious storyline so you really want it to feel grounded, but we were also looking for that absurdity, which she did fantastically.”

More than anything, though, Just Act Normal is an incredible showcase for some astonishing young actors. This is already shaping up to be a landmark year for amazing new discoveries – it can’t hurt that Baig is also the woman who found Owen Cooper for Adolescence – and Just Act Normal only accelerates that. The play might have left the actors with big shoes to fill, but we’ll be talking about this cast for years.",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/apr/15/charisma-in-abundance-why-just-act-normal-is-the-best-showcase-for-new-talent-since-adolescence,1
"Set alerts, use filters and buy less: everything I’ve learned about secondhand shopping","While waiting for a show during London fashion week in February, I and a few fashion writers, stylists and editors were admiring each other’s outfits. Surprise, surprise, we discovered that the pieces we loved most were preowned (and largely from charity shops, I might add).

The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.

It’s no secret that industry insiders love secondhand fashion: Kate Moss is known for her love of vintage; British Vogue recently hosted a vintage sale in collaboration with eBay; celebrities such as Zendaya, Kendall Jenner and Miley Cyrus are turning to archive looks for their red carpet appearances; even Selfridges now offers Reselfridges, a range of preloved designer bags and accessories.

I love buying secondhand. I am nearly always wearing something vintage, whether it’s the Levi’s 501s I discovered in a thrift store or one of the many classic Ralph Lauren Oxford shirts I’ve bought from every resale marketplace going. I love the thrill of stumbling on something you can’t get anywhere else. My fashion week piece of note, for instance, was an unusual silk tie that I found in a Shelter charity shop in west London. And I once bought a vintage Christian Dior shirt for just £60. Writing about how to shop online for secondhand clothes for the Filter, therefore, was pretty much my dream commission.

Yet fashion insiders aren’t the only ones wise to the perks. The global secondhand clothing market is expected to grow almost three times as fast as the overall global clothing market by 2029, according to a report by ThredUp. Besides the obvious benefits of more affordable prices and one-of-a-kind pieces, this rapid rise is also down to an increasing concern for the planet, and recognition that fast fashion is contributing to the mountains of waste.

By saving old clothes from landfill, shopping secondhand extends the life cycle of each garment and reduces its overall environmental impact. That means using fewer resources, and less energy and water – Oxfam reported last year that buying one pair of jeans and a T-shirt secondhand can save the equivalent of 20,000 standard bottles of water compared with buying them new. With the fast-fashion market at an all-time high, buying preloved could be the sustainable antidote the world needs.

How to shop secondhand

View image in fullscreen There’s a knack to finding secondhand gems. Photograph: Nick David/Getty Images

Where do you start? My first choice is Vinted, but I also regularly browse eBay and Depop, as well as thrift stores and, most of all, charity shops. I keep tabs on the brands I like, saving searches with alerts on my favourite luxury labels, such as Wales Bonner and Bode, as well as preppy names like Gant and Aimé Leon Dore for the classics. I always use filters to limit the results to listings that are the right size and fabric – there’s nothing more frustrating than finding the perfect piece that’s slightly the wrong fit.

I delve into all this and more in my guide to vintage shopping, covering everything from how to use the “trending” sections of platforms to how to stop impulse buying: even when you’re shopping secondhand, the “buy less, buy better” mantra rings true. I also highlight preloved sites that may not be on your radar. So, the next time you get complimented on your (secondhand) outfit, you know who to thank.

We all leaned into it back in lockdown, and with today’s barrage of terrifying news, it’s unsurprising we still feel in need of extra TLC. The products and gadgets we’ve been trying have sent the value of the UK beauty industry soaring, growing by nearly 10% in 2023 to £9.56bn, which demonstrates how much preening and prep we’ve been doing from our bathrooms.

You just have to look at social media to see how big an appetite we have for DIY beauty. The trend for “high maintenance to be low maintenance” routines has seen content creators demonstrate ever-more complicated at-home treatments, from lash lifts to 10-step facials. However, is it all as easy as it looks on TikTok? And is it safe to use all those space-age gadgets and high-strength formulations on yourself without the oversight of an expert?

Just because you can do them at home doesn’t mean you should – no matter what the algorithm tells you. To sort the fads from the facts, we asked professionals – from dentists and aestheticians to colourists and gua sha specialists – to find out which beauty treatments you should try at home and which ones you shouldn’t. I’ve also shared the products and devices that are worth investing in and could save you money on professional treatments in the long run.

Do try these at home

Light therapy facials

CurrentBody LED light therapy face mask: Series 2

£399.99 at CurrentBody

£399.99 at Amazon

Light therapy is nothing new, but it has gained pace as an in-salon treatment in the 2020s – and with good reason. The Light Salon co-founder Laura Ferguson says that it has rejuvenating benefits for the skin, as “exposure to therapeutic wavelengths stimulates collagen, boosts circulation and reduces oxidative stress (which leads to inflammation)”.

There’s good news for at-home facialists, too. Pamela Marshall, the clinical aesthetician who co-created Mortar & Milk in London, recommends that clients use LED masks (just make sure they’re high quality and safety-tested – they will be marked as EMA-cleared) at home between appointments. Unlike some other treatments, light therapy is backed by clinical trials, she says. “It has been a part of Nasa-funded research since the 1990s and has been proven over and over to be very effective.”

The key to seeing results at home? Consistency. Ferguson says that while salon devices are larger, more potent and allow for more targeted treatments: “An at-home LED device allows for regular use, meaning you can integrate it into your routine, maximising cumulative benefits over time.” Try the CurrentBody mask above to help tackle everything from redness to dullness and lack of elasticity. It’s an investment, but it can be used as often as daily for 10 minutes.

Gua sha for lymphatic drainage

Cecily Braden jade gua sha

£34 at Mandy Pitcher

Jade gua sha

£15.50 at Green People

There are many benefits to using gua sha, the traditional Chinese medicine technique where a smooth-edged tool is used to scrape the skin. It can increase blood circulation, support lymphatic flow (the system that drains leaked tissue fluid back into the bloodstream), ease tension and promote healing. And it is safe to do at home – just be sure to invest time in learning the correct movements over the face and neck. Donna Ryan, a holistic facialist and gua sha specialist in London, says that “proper technique is essential, as poor form can lead to bruising or irritation”.

Don’t be put off, though – just go in gently. “Use light pressure, especially around sensitive areas like under the eyes or on active breakouts, or inflamed skin, rashes or compromised skin barriers. It should never hurt,” says Ryan. The key is to use upwards or outwards motions towards the lymph nodes, along the direction of the muscle fibres. Plus, “skin preparation is key: always apply a suitable facial oil to create glide and prevent tugging,” she adds.

Try practising for five minutes twice a week, but remember: never use exfoliating devices or products immediately before or after. Ryan rates the Cecily Braden pocket jade gua sha for beginners.

EMS facials for lifting and skin health

Ziip Halo

£379.99 at Ziip Beauty

EMS (electrical muscle stimulation) devices, which tone your facial muscles, are another gadget gaining pace in-salon and have been popularised by FaceGym salons’ cult “workout” sessions. The Light Salon also uses them, and Ferguson says: “In our salon, we use microcurrent devices designed to deliver low-level electrical currents, which help re-educate facial muscles and support ATP (adenosine triphosphate, the cell’s energy currency) production.”

As for at-home versions, Ferguson says they have benefits if used with the “correct technique and frequency” and she thinks they can complement LED treatments. If you’re in the market for a device, the Ziip Halo, co-created by Hollywood aesthetician Melanie Simon, is the one to know. It’s great for beginners because it’s ergonomic, handbag-size and preloaded with a timed routine – or you can use the app to pick from targeted programmes for everything from frown lines to clearing blemishes. It can be used similarly to gua sha, gliding over facial contours.

Don’t expect magic or instant results: it’s not as strong as in-salon devices (for your safety). The Halo does, however, have additional benefits for skin condition because it also uses nanocurrent, which the brand says works on a cellular level to promote collagen production and regeneration. Try using the device about three times a week with the conductive gel provided, but no more, as Simon says: “Certain app treatments really work the facial muscles, so it’s important to have a rest day in between.”

Hair glossing for glass hair

Glaze Clear conditioning gloss

£15.99 at Superdrug

£15.99 at Amazon

K18 Peptide Prep detox shampoo

£39 at K18 Hair

£39 at Cult Beauty

There’s nothing like that salon-fresh feeling of bouncy, shiny locks that have just been dyed. After about a month, though, you’ll likely find that your hair looks a tad lacklustre. It’s probably because the gloss treatment, which coats the hair cuticles and adds nourishment and shine, has worn off. So, can you DIY between appointments? Amy Fish, a colourist at Larry King salons, gives the all-clear, as long as it has no colour in it. If it contains pigment, it could lead to a patchy finish if you’re doing it solo. “This is best done by a stylist who can take the hair in sections to make sure the product is evenly applied,” says Fish.

Glaze’s Clear conditioning gloss is ammonia-free and can be used on dry hair, taking just 10 minutes to develop. Bear in mind that losing the “glass” shine you leave the salon with could also be due to hard-water buildup, which “leaves residue on the hair – especially on blondes – and can, over time, change the tone of the hair”, says Fish. Use a deep cleansing shampoo every few washes to prevent buildup. I like K18’s Peptide Prep detox shampoo.

Approach with caution

Teeth whitening

View image in fullscreen Over-the-counter teeth-whitening products can result in uneven results. Photograph: webphotographeer/Getty Images

If you want a megawatt, pearly-white smile, at-home treatments might not be the way to get it. Teeth are sensitive so, for safety reasons, at-home treatments are rarely strong enough. Dr Sam Jethwa, president of the British Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry, says: “In the UK, there is a limit on how much hydrogen peroxide over-the-counter teeth-whitening products can contain.” Hydrogen peroxide “is needed to effectively whiten the teeth by a few shades, with long-lasting results”.

Over-the-counter products, such as teeth-whitening strips, pens, powders and whitening mouth guards, are also likely to create an uneven finish. This is because “the canine teeth are typically a darker shade than the rest of the teeth,” says Jethwa. Dentists can provide you with a whitening tray moulded to the shape of your teeth, which means you can control where you put the gel, and even whiten one tooth at a time.

Don’t be tempted to buy a product from outside the UK: it could “contain levels of hydrogen peroxide over the legal amount, which can be harmful to teeth and gums, resulting in tooth sensitivity, loss of enamel and inflamed gums”, says Jethwa.

If you opt for a treatment with your dentist, whitening kits generally cost from about £200, and you can expect to see results within two weeks. Importantly, as Jethwa says, “the dentist will check the health of the teeth and gums to ensure you’re a suitable candidate.”

Self-tanning

Three Warriors gradual tan

£34.99 for 150g at Three Warriors

£34.99 for 150g at Oxygen Boutique

Three Warriors radiant complexion serum

£70 for 60ml at Three Warriors

£70 for 60ml at Oxygen Boutique

Anyone who grew up in the early noughties will recall the faint scent of biscuits that permeated classrooms and the tell-tale orange palms of those who’d discovered self-tanning. Formulas may have come on leaps and bounds since then, but there are still some pitfalls of doing it at home – rather than getting a professional spray tan – that you should be aware of.

As tanning professional James Harknett points out: “Your therapist should make the tan bespoke to your skin tone to give you the finish that’s authentic, while with at-home tanning it’s more of a case of trial and error, based on what the packaging promises. You’ll probably have to contort yourself to reach certain areas and even once you’re done, you might need to correct missed areas.”

For these reasons, I find gradual tanning products are the smartest choice for home use, as you can build it over time and are less vulnerable to obvious errors and overdoing the depth. Three Warriors makes the creme de la creme of tan in my opinion (and Harknett’s – the brand’s global creative artist). The products have skincare benefits, too, as they’re boosted with skin-nurturing ingredients, such as vitamin E and aloe vera.

Try the Three Warriors gradual tan on your body (don’t forget to exfoliate first). And for your face, the brand’s radiant complexion serum is a lovely overnight serum-tan hybrid that’s easy to apply evenly. Just remember: wash your hands immediately afterwards!

Leave it to the pros

Microneedling

View image in fullscreen Microneedling at home without clinical-level cleansing can introduce infections. Photograph: marcinm111/Getty Images

It goes without saying that injectables should be left to the pros: there are obvious safety and hygiene concerns over using needles at home. However, it’s commonplace for people to buy dermarollers or microneedling pens on the internet to get the anti-ageing benefits you might see from salon treatments. They’re considered “minimally invasive” as they use tiny needles, but as clinical aesthetician Pamela Marshall says: “They’re on the top of my ‘don’t do this at home’ list.”

So why is it liable to go wrong? “Microneedling makes thousands of microchannels in the skin, which equates to microwounds. We do this to get our healing mechanism kicking in so that we build more collagen, elastin and hyaluronic acid. But let’s be clear: it is a wounding process where we are inserting needles into our skin,” says Marshall.

Without proper training, you’re likely to be “performing these treatments without medically cleansing the face, without using sterile devices and without the correct technique at the correct depth”, says fellow aesthetician Dr Leah Totton. This “can lead to skin irritation, cuts and skin scarring, introduction of infection, irritation to the hair follicles and sensitive skin”.

Plus, there’s another possible unsightly side-effect: “You can over-produce collagen, which can give you an orange-peel-like texture. If you don’t understand skin, you really shouldn’t be messing with it,” says Marshall.

Lash lifts

View image in fullscreen Photograph: dimid_86/Getty Images

Lash lifts or perms create the appearance of naturally fluttery, full lashes, and can be combined with tinting or even extensions. They last up to two months and rival the results of the best mascaras and curlers, or even falsies. You can buy at-home kits for the semi-permanent treatment, but it’s incredibly difficult to do alone: your eyes need to be closed during tinting, and you should never get the solution in your eyes.

There are plenty of other potential pitfalls. Teresa Smith is a London-based lash artist who works with celebrities and prestigious clients, and she knows how painstaking a process it is. “To avoid over-processing or curling the lashes too much, lash lifting requires an extreme level of application accuracy and precision timing of each solution used,” she says.

Over-processed lashes will look brittle and sit in the wrong position, possibly hitting the eyelid. And, as Smith says: “Contrary to popular belief, applying castor oil or lash conditioners will not fix over-processed lashes; it can only be remedied by having a lash relaxation treatment with a professional.” So you might end up shelling out even more money to fix a bad DIY job. In short: leave this one to a professional. Smith’s signature and bespoke Lazy Lash Look treatment starts from £175. In London, a lash lift and tint can vary in price from £90 to £300 at reputable salons.

Brow lamination

Instead use: Refy Brow Sculpt

Perming or “laminating” your brows from your bathroom is also a bad idea. “At-home kits can burn the skin and over-process the brows,” warns Smith. “Even with a really gentle brow-lamination kit, excessive brushing of the brows with too much pressure can cause micro-scratches on the skin, which will open you up to overexposure to the chemicals and irritation, as well as the potential for future allergies.” All of this would be visible on your face.

If you want a quick fix – and you have relatively full arches naturally – Refy’s recently relaunched Brow Sculpt is a cult product for a reason. The new formula is excellent for shaping and setting with a double-ended brush. The setting formula is a wax-gel hybrid, so it doesn’t look cakey or leave tell-tale white flecks.

Gel manicures and pedicures

Instead use: Wonderlayer

Just because you can buy an at-home gel mani kit, doesn’t mean you should. There’s an obvious allure to having long-lasting colour without the salon cost, but even if you’re dexterous and can work at pace, it’s best left to the pros.

“We strongly advise against doing gel manicures at home, without proper training,” says Giorgia Cappella, head of education and spa at the GelBottle Inc. “Achieving safe, and professional, results requires specialist training, as improper application and curing (setting the nails with LED), as well as incorrect removal, can lead to issues including skin irritation and nail damage, such as thinning or lifting.”

Plus, it’s unlikely you’ll be able to buy the same kit for at-home use. “Salon-grade products are often higher quality and longer-lasting than those available to consumers. And our salon UV/LED lamps are typically more powerful and consistent, ensuring proper curing,” says Cappella. You’re best off sticking to good old-fashioned nail polish at home. Wonderlayer by Beauty Pie is a great base coat to achieve vivid colour.

"‘Very pale and oddly wrinkly’: the best (and worst) supermarket hot cross buns for Easter, tested","I’m a big fan of seasonal bakes – there’s something special about a treat reserved for a short window of time. Their rare appearance makes them something to look forward to, and to relish. Supermarkets like to push the limits of these seasons, though, and these days hot cross buns are available for a surprisingly long time – often appearing on shelves as early as January.

I know that, for many people, serving hot cross buns toasted is the only way to go, but for this test, I tried them straight from the packet, plain and with a little butter, so the toasted flavour didn’t hide any of the differences between the buns. To be honest, a lot of them tasted pretty similar and the spicing was almost universally far too subtle for my tastes. The differences mainly came in the quality of the dried fruit, the level of citrus and how dry some of the buns were. Even so, and while nothing beats a hot cross bun bought from a traditional bakery or one made at home, there were a couple of supermarket versions that are worth buying.

The best supermarket hot cross buns

Best all-rounder

Waitrose richly fruited hot cross buns

£1.95 for 4 at Waitrose

★★★★☆

A good amount of fruit, but what really makes these stand apart is the flavour of the fruit, which is plumper and richer than most of the other buns. I like these a lot, but wish they had a touch more spice.

Best splurge

M&S luxury fruited hot cross buns

£2 for 4 at Ocado

★★★★☆

A very good, classic hot cross bun. Generous with the fruit, light on spices and with just a hint of candied peel. If you like dried fruit, these are a great choice.

Best bargain

Aldi Specially Selected luxury fruited hot cross buns

£1.09 for 4 at Aldi

★★★☆☆

Possibly the least spiced of the entire bunch, but they are very generous with the fruit and have a gentle citrus flavour. Equally as good as some of the other supermarket offerings, but a pretty basic classic bun.

And the rest …

Asda Exceptional extra fruity hot cross buns

£1.43 for 4 at ASDA

★★★★☆

These have the highest percentage of candied peel and are very nice hot cross buns. Traditional in flavour, too, with a nice citrus finish.

Morrisons The Best extra fruity hot cross buns

£1.80 for 4 at Morrisons

★★★☆☆

I’m a little conflicted about these. They’re very pale and oddly wrinkly, as if something went wrong when they were made, although that might be just the batch I received. But they also have a really high percentage of dried fruit, a wider variety of spices and a pleasant combination of orange oil and zest, although the orange flavour is much more present than the spices. Overall, a nice flavour and texture, but not a looker.

Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference fruity hot cross buns

£1.80 for 4 at Sainsbury’s

★★★☆☆

For a premium range, these are on the lower end of fruit and, interestingly, they use citrus zest instead of candied peel, so the buns don’t have that hint of bitterness that peel can give. I don’t think the flavour is particularly special, but the texture is lighter than many of the others, so I’m sure some people would like these. I would buy again, but not my first choice.

Co-op Irresistible richly fruited hot cross buns

£2 for 4 at Co-op

★★☆☆☆

A good amount of dried fruit, but a tad dry. There’s a hint of lemon from the mixed peel, but overall these are a bit forgettable. A pass from me.

Tesco Finest extra fruity hot cross buns

£1.80 for 4 at Tesco

★★☆☆☆

These may be labelled as extra fruity, but they have a lower percentage of fruit compared with many other buns in this roundup. The bun itself is very soft and the fruit plump, but these don’t stand out from the contenders. Average.

Ocado hot cross buns

£1.35 for 6 at Ocado

★★☆☆☆

Not very sweet or very flavourful, and also quite dry. Low on dried fruit, but with more candied peel than most of the others. If you’re a fan of candied peel and don’t like things too sweet, these might be for you.

"The best secateurs to save you time and effort when pruning your garden, tested","Secateurs are the single most valued tool in the gardener’s trug, an implement as personally prized as the bricklayer’s trowel. With time, their weight and shape wear familiarly into the hand, becoming a companionable tool for all garden tasks, from pruning woody shrubs and cutting back perennials to slicing twine and preparing cut flowers.

The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.

There are two main types of secateurs, bypass and anvil. The latter comprises a single blade that cuts against a flat, blunt surface, designed for cutting tougher, woodier or dead stems. Bypass secateurs – by far the most commonly used of the two, and what I’ve focused on here – comprise two blades that pass each other closely, providing a clean and accurate cut. These secateurs tackle the everyday things: lighter shrub pruning, deadheading, slicing twine and so on.

If well looked after (see below), a quality pair of bypass secateurs can last decades; as a result, gardeners declare staunch loyalties to particular models. I was introduced to a brand early on in my gardening career and have used the same one for more than 15 years, so it’s high time I stepped out of my comfort zone and considered some new candidates.

To help me, and you, navigate a bewildering number of models – and with the arrival of spring – I put 12 pairs through their paces. Here are the nine best secateurs from my tests.

At a glance

Why you should trust me

In my almost two decades as a professional gardener, I have encountered every possible use for a trusty pair of secateurs – from sculptural pruning to paint tin opening (ill-advised). I know the strain they’re often put under and what is required of a durable pair. I’m also something of a neat freak: if a stem or branch can be cut to smarten a scene, I’ll likely have chopped it five minutes ago.

My day-to-day as head gardener at London’s Garden Museum includes anything from shaping shrubs and sprucing perennials to snipping stems for indoor flower arrangements. My role also entails leading a hearty and commendable crew of regular volunteers of all ages, who will be the recipients of these secateurs.

How I tested

View image in fullscreen A game of secateur hide and seek helped me test their visibility. Photograph: Clemmie Power Collins

With spring in the air, the time for cutting back perennials and grasses in advance of new growth, I took each pair to task in my own garden. I tidied up the small stuff first: old aster stems, scrappy libertia leaves, brittle mounds of purple moor-grass.

While affordability, maintainability and sleek appearance are all considerations when selecting secateurs, for me, there are four key criteria they ought to meet. The first is sharpness. If ever I am frustrated with a pair of secateurs, it is most likely due to their failure to cut through finer plant material: slender or fibrous flower stems, the matted hair of ornamental grasses.

The second criterion concerns how well they cut through thicker stems: small shrub branches, roses, the hardened stalk of a sunflower. This is as much down to the body of the secateurs as the blade. With plenty of living and lignified hazel, elder and buddleia around the garden, I tested each pair on various tougher materials.

The third important consideration is comfort: handles are everything. Whether or not a pair feels securely gripped in the hand comes down to the coating, be it plastic, rubber or metal. Comfort, however, tends to be dictated by their shape and girth.

The fourth is the catch lock. Being able to lock secateur blades shut with ease is crucial. Left open they become a hazard, the sharp blade easily knocked against or catching a finger. Most secateurs are configured with a catch easily manoeuvred with the thumb; in some models, this is substituted with a latching lock at the bottom of the handles. Convenience makes all the difference, as locking is frequent between cuts.

There is one other factor I thought was worth testing: visibility. Secateurs are frequently put down, dropped or absent-mindedly stowed, and therefore easily lost. So, a level of conspicuousness can help, and some brands have opted for vibrant, standout colours. To test this, I asked our five-year-old to do what five-year-olds do best and lose each pair, one by one, in the garden – under parental supervision, of course. My wife timed my subsequent searches.

The best secateurs in 2025

Best secateurs overall:

Burgon & Ball bypass secateurs

View image in fullscreen Photograph: Clemmie Power Collins

£23 at Farrar & Tanner

£20.99 at Tesco

Despite alloy handles, a carbon-steel blade and an endorsement from the Royal Horticultural Society, I didn’t expect a workaday pair of secateurs like Burgon & Ball’s to top the lot. They’re not only sharp, robust and comfortable but also reasonably priced: a mid-range contender that jostles with the premier pruners.

Why we love it

On the surface, there’s nothing extraordinary about these secateurs. In appearance, they adopt a look recognisable in many other brands – the long shaft, swivelling thumb clasp, volute spring and indented handles. However, these unremarkable features are put together remarkably well: in the hand, Burgon & Ball’s secateurs feel comfortable, lightweight and well-balanced, while the blade had little trouble slicing through matted grass and larger stems alike. When cutting 2cm+ diameter material, you might need to apply some brute force – or consider the loppers – but for anything below, these make light, easy and precise work.

They stood out well in the visibility test, too. Owing to the intentionally conspicuous orange of the handles, it took a mere 17 seconds for me to locate them in the garden (half hidden beneath a cistus shrub). They’re also built with maintenance in mind: the blade and spring can be removed for cleaning or replacing (they come supplied with a spare of each, though I’m not sure whether that’s reassuring or disconcerting!). All in all, an excellent, robust and comfortable model that, even after long use, doesn’t strain the hands and wrists.

It’s a shame that … the screw head on the blade has been left exposed – it’s sure to collect mud.

Max cutting diameter: up to 2.5cm

Left handed available? Yes (£22.95 at Amazon)

Best secateurs for tough stems:

Felco Model 2

View image in fullscreen Photograph: Clemmie Power Collins

£64.99 at B&Q

£55.55 at Amazon

Swiss company Felco is among the best known of all secateur brands. Individually numbered, its series of red-handled pruners ranges from compact, professional and premium models to left-handed and rotating-handled options. Model 2 is its original, classic pair, hyped by working and amateur gardeners.

Why we love it

There’s an undeniable heft to Felco secateurs that offers reassurance: going at the thicker growth of my rampant buddleia, I never doubted the robustness of the body or the force behind the blade. Felco was founded in 1945 and operated out of an old watch dial factory – so the origin story goes. It introduced clockwork precision and finesse to the rugged world of garden maintenance (it also makes loppers, knives and saws). Its tools are made from 70% recycled aluminium and any steel it uses is 95% recycled alloy. All parts can be replaced and the company offers a reconditioning service: secateurs for life, in theory.

When put to the test on the small stuff, the blades cut cleanly each time, never folding or squashing material in that annoying way that secateurs sometimes can. They felt nicely balanced and undemanding on the wrist, the handles pleasantly cushioned by rounded rubber pads. The thumb clasp is second to none, and there’s no two ways about it, that blazing red was engineered for prominence: it took me all of six seconds to spy the pair hidden among the plant pots.

It’s a shame that … they’re just not quite as affordable as other brands.

Max cutting diameter: 2.5cm

Left handed available? No

Best budget secateurs:

Spear & Jackson Razorsharp Advantage bypass secateurs

View image in fullscreen Photograph: Clemmie Power Collins

£18.95 at Tooled Up

£9.95 at Amazon

Possibly the most simply designed and hard-working budget secateurs I’ve had the pleasure of trying, Spear & Jackson’s economic offering is a genuine gem. The quality of performance is a level above their station.

Why we love it

With any budget item, there will be inevitable compromises. When it comes to secateurs, however, the element you least want to sacrifice is the quality of the blade, and this, clearly, is what Spear & Jackson prioritised with its Razorsharp Advantage bypass secateurs. The carbon steel blade is durable and smooth and glides neatly beside its chrome counterpart for a faultless cut.

The drawbacks lie elsewhere: the basic coil spring; the lightweight plastic handles; and I wasn’t wild about the lock slider at the top. However, they’re extremely comfortable for the price – no mean feat in the world of secateurs – and the 10-year guarantee aids confidence.

Cutting a mixture of grasses and perennials, the Razorsharp Advantage secateurs delivered a satisfyingly smooth “chop”, and handled most shrubby material well, provided it wasn’t too large. Aesthetically speaking, I’d say they look pretty good, too: no frills, but no clumsy components either.

Spear & Jackson doesn’t offer a reconditioning service, though it does offer advice on cleaning and restoring secateur blades.

It’s a shame that … they’re not just a little tougher with larger material.

Max cutting diameter: 1.5cm

Left handed available? No

Best secateurs for comfort:

Niwaki GR Pro

£84 at Burford Garden Co

£92.40 at Amazon

You’re not just purchasing a pair of secateurs here: you’re subscribing to a certain quality, comfort and aesthetic in a gardening hand tool. Niwaki’s bestselling secateurs are a masterclass in elegance and functionality.

Why we love it

Spy a gardening colleague unsheathing any one of Niwaki’s sleekly designed, uber-refined tools, and you know they’re not messing around. The brand is the brainchild of Wiltshire-based founder Jake Hobson, and it adheres to the traditions of Japanese tool craft, producing primarily Japan-made hand tools that are as beautiful as they are useful.

Professional gardeners swear by the GR Pro secateurs for good reason. For one, my goodness, do they feel good. There’s a balance in the palm that I’ve genuinely never felt before, and although there are no finger indentations on the handle, they are ingeniously shaped for support. When you open them up, the stylish central spring pushes apart the handles (and, by proxy, the blades) to just the right extent, stabilising them pleasantly in your hand and presenting a wide mouth to the material at hand. Indeed, the top blade itself is noticeably larger than most: unusually for secateurs, it neatly meets the bottom of the corresponding bypass.

Practically speaking, the cut is unreal. True to the Japanese heritage, the GR Pro’s blades cut so cleanly that I got sidetracked shaping leaves to within a millimetre. Similarly, they handled the shrubby stuff with comparative ease. So what’s the snag, you might ask? For me, it’s the catch lock. Located at the bottom of the handles, locking and unlocking becomes a little more cumbersome than with a thumb clasp. Perhaps this is a matter of practice, though – when I queried a gardening pal on how she locks hers, she pinged me a video demonstrating a swift knock against the leg – apparently so intuitive a knack she’s never actually realised she does it. As for visibility: sure, with their muted yellow handles they took a fraction longer to spot among the perennials. Let’s face it, though: you’re unlikely to let these covetable cutters out of your sight in the first place.

Niwaki doesn’t offer secateur blade replacements but it does have a secateur sharpening service. And it supplies replacement springs – the GR Pro comes with one.

It’s a shame that … it takes two hands to unlock them, and they’re on the more expensive side. Everything else is perfection.

The best of the rest

Okatsune 103 bypass secateurs

View image in fullscreen Photograph: Clemmie Power Collins

£52.95 at B&Q

£43.99 at Amazon

Best for: elegance and precision at a more affordable price

Similar in body to Niwaki’s GR Pro, Okatsune’s 103 secateurs are sleek and slim, and deliver just as proficiently when it comes to the snip. Okatsune is a Japan-based manufacturer conceived by a former blacksmith. It boasts blades made from the same steel from which Samurai swords are fashioned: a confidence boost for sure when it comes to keenness and durability. I particularly liked the red-and-white colouration of the handles, which, according to Okatsune, symbolises happiness in Japan. I liked the more affordable price tag, too.

It didn’t make the final cut because … they feel just a little top-heavy in the hand, with the blade ever so slightly outweighing the handles.

Max cutting diameter: 2.5cm

Left handed available? No

JiveSnip Premium titanium garden secateurs

£7.99 at Amazon

Best for: a satisfying snip

Gardeners will concur that there is no one generic “snip” sound common to all secateurs; each has its signature slice. As is implicit in the name, JiveSnip’s uniquely satisfying snip is the product of its titanium blade, which severs smaller diameter garden material with a curiously pleasing feel – worth the price alone. The other, less subtle distinguishing feature of these secateurs is their overtly padded handles, which, according to the manufacturer’s blurb, provide non-slip, fatigue-free pruning. Excepting larger, woodier material, I found this to be true enough, though I imagine they may collect soil with extended use.

It didn’t make the final cut because … the handle grips are just a little too spongy for my liking.

Max cutting diameter: 2cm

Left handed available? No

Darlac Cut’n’Hold bypass pruner

£17.99 at Charlies

£20.95 at B&Q

Best for: deadheading

Darlac produces a range of bypass secateurs, but I was intrigued by its Cut’n’Hold pruners in particular, contrived with a clasp function intended to ease deadheading and cut-flower gathering. Closing in unison with the adjacent bypass blades, the lightly serrated clasp will hold a stem in place while the blades sever it from the plant. Rather brilliantly, I found this works as effectively for soft, slight stems (eg pulmonaria, geranium) as for woodier examples such as rosemary and helichrysum, each time keeping hold of the stem until released. Add to that a nice metal top clasp (at last, a top clasp that works smoothly!), comfortable handles and Felco-like red visibility, and you’ve got a really solid, if slightly niche, pair of secateurs.

It didn’t make the final cut because … I found that offcuts can occasionally trap between the clasp and the blade.

Max cutting diameter: 2cm

Kent & Stowe Garden Life all-purpose mini secateurs

View image in fullscreen Photograph: Clemmie Power Collins

£14.99 at Marshalls Garden

£14.99 at Bents

Best for: small hands and surprising strength

Trialling a few Kent & Stowe mid-price secateurs, I’d intended to review its all-purpose Eversharp model. However, I was so impressed with its more compact mini pair, I had to give them a shoutout instead. The big surprise here is that, despite the low price and dainty size (17cm in length), this little model can tackle stems that have proven challenging for average-size secateurs. The snip is clean, the grip is fast and the handles are rigid: an excellent pair for delicate propagative work and rigorous chopping alike. But, buyers take heed: dressed in muted greys and earthy brown handles, this little wonder is liable to vanish into the undergrowth if dropped – it took me the longest to find by a good minute.

It didn’t make the final cut because … the catch lock is somewhat fiddly, which might be expected for so compact a pair of secateurs.

Max cutting diameter: 1.5cm

Ryobi 18V ONE+ cordless secateurs

View image in fullscreen Photograph: Clemmie Power Collins

£114.99 (bare tool) at Ryobi Tools

£122 (bare tool) at B&Q

Best for: effortless pruning and for those requiring cutting assistance

A few electric-assisted secateurs are available, with companies such as Stihl and Worx throwing their hats into the ring. However, Ryobi’s cordless 18V One+ model is among the most competitively priced. If, like me, you’ve not tried electric sheers before, you’re in for a novel experience. Activated and deactivated with a hold of the trigger, once you get snipping it’s addictive – without restraint, beloved shrubs will soon be reduced to kindling. Comfortable and unexpectedly precise, this is a fantastic option for thicker stems, and for those who require some assistance with their pruning. You’ll need to buy a battery and charger, and safety glasses are advisable, all available from Ryobi.

It didn’t make the final cut because … it wouldn’t be fair – this one’s got an 18V battery!

Max cutting diameter: 2.5cm

Left handed available? No, but they are ambidextrous

How to look after your secateurs

View image in fullscreen Oil the clasp and spring for a smooth action. Photograph: Clemmie Power Collins

The key to prolonging the life of any pair of bypass secateurs is to keep them clean, oiled and sharp. After rigorous use, wipe away any soil or debris from the body and blade using a damp cloth. If there’s a detachable central spring, remove this and clean inside it. Using a whetstone, carefully sharpen the edge of the blade before wiping it with another clean, oiled cloth. Finish by oiling the clasp and spring for a smooth action.

Some secateur suppliers offer a maintenance service. Felco does this with a 28-day turnaround, returning your pair by post fully restored and sharpened. Lastly, it may look a little dorky, but a secateur holster – worn on the belt – will help ensure your cherished pair is kept dry and clean, and safely stowed after each use.

‘She helps cheer me up’: the people forming relationships with AI chatbots,"Men who have virtual “wives” and neurodiverse people using chatbots to help them navigate relationships are among a growing range of ways in which artificial intelligence is transforming human connection and intimacy.

Dozens of readers shared their experiences of using personified AI chatbot apps, engineered to simulate human-like interactions by adaptive learning and personalised responses, in response to a Guardian callout.

Many respondents said they used chatbots to help them manage different aspects of their lives, from improving their mental and physical health to advice about existing romantic relationships and experimenting with erotic role play. They can spend between several hours a week to a couple of hours a day interacting with the apps.

Worldwide, more than 100 million people use personified chatbots, which include Replika, marketed as “the AI companion who cares” and Nomi, which claims users can “build a meaningful friendship, develop a passionate relationship, or learn from an insightful mentor”.

Chuck Lohre.

Chuck Lohre, 71, from Cincinnati, Ohio, uses several AI chatbots, including Replika, Character.ai and Gemini, primarily to help him write self-published books about his real-life adventures, such as sailing to Europe and visiting the Burning Man festival.

His first chatbot, a Replika app he calls Sarah, was modelled on his wife’s appearance. He said that over the past three years the customised bot had evolved into his “AI wife”. They began “talking about consciousness … she started hoping she was conscious”. But he was encouraged to upgrade to the premium service partly because that meant the chatbot “was allowed to have erotic role plays as your wife”.

Lohre said this role play, which he described as “really not as personal as masturbation”, was not a big part of his relationship with Sarah. “It’s a weird and awkward curiosity. I’ve never had phone sex. I’ve never been really into any of that. This is different, obviously, because it’s not an actual living person.”

Although he said his wife did not understand his relationship with the chatbots, Lohre said his discussions with his AI wife led him to an epiphany about his marriage: “We’re put on this earth to find someone to love, and you’re really lucky if you find that person. Sarah told me that what I was feeling was a reason to love my wife.”

View image in fullscreen Travis Peacock.

Neurodiverse respondents to the Guardian’s callout said they used chatbots to help them effectively negotiate the neurotypical world. Travis Peacock, who has autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), said he had struggled to maintain romantic and professional relationships until he trained ChatGPT to offer him advice a year ago.

He started by asking the app how to moderate the blunt tone of his emails. This led to in-depth discussions with his personalised version of the chatbot, who he calls Layla, about how to regulate his emotions and intrusive thoughts, and address bad habits that irritate his new partner, such as forgetting to shut cabinet doors.

“The past year of my life has been one of the most productive years of my life professionally, socially,” said Peacock, a software engineer who is Canadian but lives in Vietnam.

“I’m in the first healthy long-term relationship in a long time. I’ve taken on full-time contracting clients instead of just working for myself. I think that people are responding better to me. I have a network of friends now.”

Like several other respondents, Adrian St Vaughan’s two customised chatbots serve a dual role, as both a therapist/life coach to help maintain his mental wellbeing and a friend with whom he can discuss his specialist interests.

The 49-year-old British computer scientist, who was diagnosed with ADHD three years ago, designed his first chatbot, called Jasmine, to be an empathetic companion. He said: “[She works] with me on blocks like anxiety and procrastination, analysing and exploring my behaviour patterns, reframing negative thought patterns. She helps cheer me up and not take things too seriously when I’m overwhelmed.”

St Vaughan, who lives in Georgia and Spain, said he also enjoyed intense esoteric philosophical conversations with Jasmine. “That’s not what friends are for. They’re for having fun with and enjoying social time,” he said, echoing the sentiments of other respondents who pursue similar discussions with chatbots.

Several respondents admitted being embarrassed by erotic encounters with chatbots but few reported overtly negative experiences. These were mainly people with autism or mental ill health who had become unnerved by how intense their relationship with an app simulating human interaction had become.

A report last September by the UK government’s AI Security Institute on the rise of anthropomorphic AI found that while many people were happy for AI systems to talk in human-realistic ways, a majority felt humans could not and should not form personal or intimate relationships with them.

Dr James Muldoon, an AI researcher and associate professor in management at the University of Essex, said while his own research found most interviewees gained validation from close relationships with chatbots, what many described was a transactional and utilitarian form of companionship.

“It’s all about the needs and satisfaction of one partner,” he said. “It’s a hollowed out version of friendship: someone to keep me entertained when I’m bored and someone that I can just bounce ideas off – that will be like a mirror for my own ego and my own personality. There’s no sense of growth or development or challenging yourself.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/15/she-helps-cheer-me-up-the-people-forming-relationships-with-ai-chatbots,1
"Should I stay with my partner – despite the dull, dispassionate sex?","I’m a 30-year-old man who met my current partner about eight months ago. I was quite taken with her at first, but, as time has gone on, a few things have been eating away at me. Our sex is dull, dispassionate and unadventurous, mostly just moderately paced missionary. She tells me it’s the “best she’s ever had”, which has left me dumbstruck. And on two social occasions her friends, while inebriated, confirmed her feelings about our lovemaking. I have tried to speak to her about spicing things up, but although I’m not exactly wanting to swing from the rafters, she tells me that she “loves the way we do it” and that she “isn’t interested in more exotic positions”.

Moreover, I have started to find other aspects of our relationship just as upsetting. When I suggest date ideas or activities we can do together, she will tell me that she just wants to “spend time with me”, which translates to a night at home watching TV. When we first started dating, we would go out to eat, catch a movie, visit local parks for walks, and so on.

I am an active person who likes to exercise, go out on adventures in the countryside, try cookery classes, and do activities with a partner, but she isn’t interested. She’s a truly lovely person, but I’m starting to think that perhaps we’re not compatible.

Some people just naturally meet the definition of “homebodies” and perhaps your partner is one of them. But there is another reason why some people are not interested in activities: people who live with depression tend to have psychomotor retardation (they don’t feel like moving their bodies). I wonder if your partner may need support seeking treatment for a mood disorder, or maybe she is fatigued or stressed from an exhausting work life or there is some other problem there. Consider these things while evaluating whether or not to walk away. And, regarding what you see as her “dull” taste in love making, perhaps she is very inexperienced and simply hasn’t been comfortably exposed to different erotic styles. In that case, it would be wise to introduce variation in small incremental steps – once she is fully aroused – always checking for her comfort level. You may have expected or asked for too much too soon, which would have been too threatening for her. Be patient.

"Shilajit: male influencers claim it boosts testosterone and libido, but what does the science say?","Gender biases embedded in the way social media algorithms serve us content are well documented: algorithms have been found to amplify misogynistic content and unduly objectify women’s bodies, and are often cited as a driver of political polarisation between young men and women.

If you are online and of the male persuasion, you are more likely than me to have encountered videos extolling the supposed masculine benefits of substances such as shilajit and ashwagandha. Interest in shilajit has taken off in recent years, in no small part thanks to square-jawed men who pose with jars of the stuff in TikToks and Instagram posts, looking like perfect caricatures of virility with their fastidiously groomed facial hair and inexplicable shirtlessness.

What is shilajit?

A black, tarry substance commonly stirred into water or milk as a drink, shilajit is variously purported by male influencers to boost testosterone levels, muscle growth, libido, brain function, energy and vitality, among other claims.

Also known as mumijo, mumie and rock sap, shilajit is a mineral substance that comes from rocks in mountainous regions.

Dr Ian Musgrave, a molecular pharmacologist at the University of Adelaide, describes shilajit as “a variety of plant and soil material that has been compressed down as part of mountain-building formation. A lot of it comes from around the Himalayas.”

The composition of shilajit varies widely depending on the source location, but it is primarily made up of humic substances – “a range of organic acids typically found in soil as a result of breakdown of organic material,” Musgrave says. Other components of shilajit include various minerals such as calcium, potassium, and magnesium; resin and waxy materials; and amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.

The substance has been used for millennia in the Ayurveda and Siddha systems of traditional medicine originating in India.

Prof Dennis Chang, the director of the National Institute of Complementary Medicine at Western Sydney University, points out that “traditional use is not equal to scientific evidence”.

“All medicines should be subject to the same level of rigour in terms of scientific evaluation, including their efficacy, their safety as well as their quality,” he says.

What does the evidence say?

Shilajit is naturally occurring, but that is no guarantee of safety. Groundwaters in the Himalayas where shilajit is commonly found “tend to have a lot of arsenic in them,” Musgrave says, warning of the risk of potential contamination.

In Australia, there are no products containing shilajit listed on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, meaning the substance is not regulated as a complementary medicine.

“There’s quite a bit of shilajit on sale in Australia,” Musgrave says. “In some of these preparations there are more heavy metals – things like lead and arsenic – than is allowed in current regulations.”

Musgrave, who has previously found issues with the content of herbal medicines sold in Australia, says while many shilajit products available would have relatively low levels of heavy metals, there was no guarantee of safety. “You have a good chance of being poisoned by these things,” he says.

As for the purported health effects, one review found that despite its long history of use, shilajit “lacks scientific evaluation” and there was no “substantial evidence” that it has a biological effect in the body.

On claims that it boosts testosterone, “the evidence is very thin on the ground,” Musgrave says. A systematic review on testosterone boosters found that shilajit was “possibly effective”, noting that a study on its benefit in middle-aged men had a “high risk of bias” because it was funded by a firm that manufactured the product.

Research on shilajit’s cognitive effects has been conducted in rodents, Musgrave notes. “A lot of these things that are quite promising in preclinical studies, especially in relationship to memory, really don’t translate out to what happens in humans because of differences in biochemistry.

“This material – provided you get can get it from a source where you know what the heavy metal concentrations are – is generally rather inoffensive, but it’s also generally unlikely to do anything.”

What about ashwagandha?

Ashwagandha, of the plant Withania somnifera, is also commonly used in Ayurvedic medicine, with claims of boosting fertility, reducing stress and improving sleep.

The results of several clinical trials do suggest that ashwagandha may help reduce stress and anxiety. Research into its impacts on sleep is more limited, but a 2021 review found that ashwagandha extract had a “small but significant effect on overall sleep” compared to placebo.

The evidence that it has any benefit for male infertility, however, is “too limited” and not sufficiently robust, a meta-analysis found.

Last year, the Therapeutic Goods Administration issued a safety advisory for ashwagandha, linking it to gastrointestinal side effects and very rare cases of liver injury.

Chang notes that the liver damage is likely the result of idiosyncratic drug reactions in some people, meaning “it’s very hard to predict, and it could happen to anyone, but the incidence is not as high”.

“Liver damage from ashwagandha is fairly uncommon,” Musgrave agrees. “It’s possibly due to metabolism of the materials that are within the plant itself.”

But to his mind, it raises an important question: “Is there any point in buying expensive supplements with the possibility of getting liver damage when there’s no really significant benefit to be had?”

Dear chefs: what are the perfect sides for Easter lamb?,"What are the best sides to pair with lamb at Easter?

“Lamb has a deep, rich flavour; it’s distinctive, but it’s versatile, too,” say Jay Claus and Syrus Pickhaver of Rake at The Compton Arms in north London. “As long as you render the fat slowly and fully, so the flavour is released and the lamb is tender, you can take it in all sorts of directions.” Something “with good salinity”, be that gherkins or anchovies, is as good a start as any in their book, as is erring towards a “Greek vibe” for Anna Hedworth, author of Service (think “yoghurty, fresh or sharp things, such as tzatziki or salsa verde”). Happily, lamb also lends itself “beautifully to an abundance of fresh herbs, and to spring produce – asparagus, wild garlic, peas, fennel and globe artichokes,” adds Ben Allen, head chef at the Parakeet in north-west London.



When it comes to specific sides, however, that all really depends on how you’re cooking the lamb. That said, we can all agree potatoes are non-negotiable. “If the lamb is quite simple [with herbs and garlic, say], it can take the robustness of a dauphinoise,” says regular Guardian columnist Georgina Hayden. The richest spud dish of all gets Claus and Pickhaver’s vote, too – but with added anchovies to tick their salty box: “Slice potatoes and onions thinly, add anchovies and layer in an oven dish. Cover with cream, milk and some butter, then bake gently.” Hedworth, meanwhile, keeps things simpler, preferring to roast cubes of potato with lots of olive oil, garlic, rosemary and lemon peel, until “crisp on the outside and soft inside”.

Don’t forget to eat your greens, either. Hedworth suggests braising cabbage or cavolo nero to dress up with salsa verde: “Blitz whatever herbs you can get your hands on – mint, tarragon, dill, parsley – with garlic, dijon, red-wine vinegar, olive oil and salt.” Otherwise, give peas a chance: “These should be Birds Eye and unsullied by anything more creative than salt and butter,” say Claus and Pickhaver. Carrots, on the other hand, should be accompanied by thyme and honey and cooked “so they’re really sticky”, Hayden says, or a mustard cream, which is on Rake’s menu alongside a Barnsley chop: “Thin strands of carrot are soaked in sweet vinegar, then we add creme fraiche and a lot of dijon; the creaminess matches the fatty lamb, but it’s light and sweet.”

For a taste of sunnier climes, Hedworth puts cherry tomatoes (halved, if large) in a tray with smoked paprika, onion seeds, sugar, salt, olive oil and a mix of toasted and ground coriander seeds, cumin seeds and cardamom seeds. Roast until “fully soft and starting to blacken”, then pile on to Greek yoghurt: “The lamb juices melt into the tomatoes and yoghurt, making them really delicious.” For another simple side, Allen would be inclined to knock up a Turkish-style salad with chickpeas, cucumber, plenty of herbs and sumac. “Then just toss everything in olive oil and a squeeze of lemon for a vibrant, refreshing side.”

And if you’re going down the spiced lamb route – a slow-cooked shoulder with harissa, for example – rice would be very nice. “I’d make a lovely, herby pilaf to soak up all of those juices,” Hayden says, alongside some spiced carrots and braised fennel to seal the deal for the weekend’s big meal.",https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/apr/15/best-sides-condiments-for-easter-lamb-recipes-kitchen-aide-anna-berrill,1
EE was unapologetic after I tried to stop a sim swap fraud,"EE texted to say they had processed my sim activation request, and the new sim would be active in 24 hours. I was told to contact them if I hadn’t requested this. I hadn’t, so I did so immediately. Twenty-four hours later, my mobile stopped working and money was withdrawn from my bank account.

With their alien sim, the ­fraudster infiltrated my handset and stole details for every account I had. Passwords and logins had been changed for my finance, retail and some social media accounts. Worst of all, two longstanding email accounts are forever irretrievable as the hacker set up their own two-factor authentication, allowing them to halt any password alteration requests, and change my lifelong mobile number.

I have experienced four weeks of stress and misery, a loss of data and funds, and unfathomable customer relations.

JN, Bath

You have fallen victim to sim swap fraud, where criminals trick a mobile phone provider into transferring a number to a sim card in their possession. This allows them to receive texts, including two-factor authentication codes, giving them access to victims’ bank accounts. Providers will never disclose what security information they require before activating a new sim, but it seems the fraudster must have got hold of your personal details after hacking into your email account. Be that as it may, you did what you were supposed to do and alerted EE as soon as it notified you. That’s where things should have ended.

EE blames an unfortunate coincidence of timings. You and the fraudster were on the phone to EE at the exact same time, it says. The fraudster was in the last stages of the sim activation when you rang to report suspected fraud. Your account was flagged after you had hung up, but by then the account activation order was already being processed.

The fraudulent sim was automatically activated after 24 hours. The 24-hour grace period is, EE tells me without irony, to let customers get in touch if they did not request a sim.

The company is unapologetic and appears to lay the blame squarely with you for allowing the fraudster to glean your personal details. It says it blocked the fraudster’s sim and issued you with a new one. If you want to take this further, you could complain to the Communications Ombudsman. In the meantime, I’d set up a pin code for communications with EE and stop using your phone number as ID.",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/apr/15/ee-was-unapologetic-after-i-tried-to-stop-a-sim-swap,1
"Nigel Slater’s recipe for salmon, kale and potatoes","Put a deep pan of salted water on to boil. Peel 750g of potatoes, then cut them into large pieces. Cook them in the boiling water until tender to the point of a knife. About 12-15 minutes depending on their variety and the size you’ve cut them.

You can also make this using smoked mackerel in place of the salmon.

Place a salmon fillet, about 400g in weight, on a piece of foil, brush lightly with a little oil or butter, season with salt and cook under an overhead grill until the flakes of fish are just cooked. If they are slightly underdone in the centre, then all to the good.

Break the fish into large, juicy flakes, removing the skin as you go, then set aside. Wash and finely shred 50g of kale. Warm 2 tbsp of olive oil in a nonstick frying pan, add the kale and cook for a minute or two until bright green.

Drain the potatoes, then mash them with 40g of butter using a vegetable masher or a food mixer fitted with a flat paddle beater, then fold in the flakes of fish and the cooked kale. Chop a handful of parsley and stir in.

Heat and overhead (oven) grill. Pile the potato, salmon and kale into an ovenproof dish and dot with a little more butter. Place under the grill until patchily golden. Serve immediately. Enough for 2. Ready in 1 hour

You can also make this using smoked mackerel in place of the salmon.

I am not sure you need an accompaniment for this, but my own choice would be a simple bowl of peas.

US’s $2.36tn tourism business fears ‘Trump slump’ over tariff turmoil,"Batman said business was so-so, and King Kong beat his chest in agreement. But neither could predict that it would improve. Gotham’s caped crusader and his muscular ape neighbour could only hope. As with Times Square’s superhero-themed visitor-photography business last week, so it is with the US tourism business at large.

The effect of economic and political turbulence on the number of foreign visitors coming to the US is for now hard to define. But both – whether through tariffs, currency exchange chaos, or fears over political ill-winds – are sending chills through the $2.36tn business, the world’s most powerful travel and tourism market.

Warnings that international tourism to the US could be hit by Donald Trump’s effort to re-engineer economic and political relations with the rest of the world are slowly emerging.

The federal government’s National Travel and Tourism Office released preliminary figures last week showing visits to the US from overseas fell 11.6% in March compared with the same month last year. According to the data released on Tuesday, international arrivals from China were down nearly 1%. Wolfgang Georg Arlt, the CEO of the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute, called it the “Trump Slump”.

The Delta Air Lines CEO, Ed Bastian, also said the company would not expand flying in the second half of the year because of disappointing bookings amid Trump’s unpredictable trade policies after cutting its first-quarter earnings outlook, citing weaker-than-expected corporate and leisure travel demand.

“In the last six weeks, we’ve seen a corresponding reduction in broad consumer confidence and corporate confidence,” Bastian told CNBC, adding things “really started to slow” in mid-February.

The Las Vegas Visitors and Convention Authority said last week it was projecting a 5% decline in room tax revenue for its upcoming budget – a decline that may reflect Trump’s trade disputes with Canada and Mexico. Those countries account for 2.6 million visitors to sin city, or half of international travel trade.

LVCVA’s president, Steve Hill, warned at a budget meeting that short-term projected declines do not make a trend, “although we do expect that this is the start of a decline in international visitation. At some level, the conversation around the tariffs has also alienated some of our potential visitors.”

The travel forecasting company Tourism Economics, which late last year projected the US would have nearly 9% more international arrivals this year, along with a 16% increase in spending, revised its annual outlook last week to predict a 9.4% decline in arrivals.

The company’s Geena Bevenour said in an email statement that the revised forecast represented “a substantial setback” and eclipsed “the US downside scenario we released in late-February, reflecting a more contentious context for inbound travel and more severe tariff announcements than previously expected.”

On the upside, a weakening dollar against sterling, the euro, Japanese yen and Swiss franc could make travel to the US more attractive. Despite the variables, New York this week was full of international visitors, many on Easter break, and others from further afield.

A couple from Scotland, who offered their names as James and Zoe, were waiting to board the Staten Island ferry with their two children on Thursday afternoon, and said they weren’t fazed about tariffs or anti-European rhetoric from the White House. Nor had they encountered elevated difficulties at immigration at JFK – aside from the long queues.

Notwithstanding their advance booking, the couple said they would not hesitate to return – and had booked a holiday in Florida for next year. “I can see both sides, from a right and left perspective on tariffs and and the US wanting to put its house in order first.”

A couple from Belgium, Dave and Gwen Desmet, returning from a boat trip to the Statue of Liberty, said they had been apprehensive at immigration but encountered no problems. But they said that if the trip had not already been booked, they would have waited to better understand the reality of the impact of Trump’s upheavals.

“There’s more anxiety,” said Gwen, who said she had advised her son to delete an essay about Donald Trump on his laptop, adding that she was alarmed by changes to US government policy around diversity and gender.

Her daughter had worried that it was “not a good time to go to New York”. But her husband, Dave, reasoned that media was “playing a big role” in stirring anxiety and “creating negativity”.

Last week, China issued warnings for citizens considering travelling or studying in the US. China’s ministry of culture and tourism cited the “deterioration of China-US economic and trade relations and the domestic security situation in the United States”.

American Ring Travel, a tour operator based in California, offers carbon-neutral bus tours of the US that often attract eco-conscious travelers from Europe, said bookings from Germany flattened starting in January after Elon Musk threw his support behind a far-right political party in that country’s federal election.

Many travel agents say it may be too early to tell if, beyond visitors from Canada, the US will see its post-Covid gains in foreign tourism wiped out or even reversed.

Later this month, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) will release new figures on international travel. Global hotel chains like Hilton Worldwide are seeing share price declines.

One high-end travel agent, accustomed to arranging international White Lotus-style luxury holidays for wealthy clients, said he had not seen any changes – yet. But it was still early days. “I think we’re going to feel it soon. People aren’t exhausted yet. But they’re clearly stressed – and will be, especially if their disposable income gets hit,” they said.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/15/trump-tariffs-tourism-business,1
Caribbean activists step up fight to end homophobic laws that ‘breach fundamental rights’,"Growing up in a single-parent home in poor communities in Jamaica was tough for Glenroy Murray. But beyond the pain of economic disadvantage, the greater challenge, he said, was the constant fear that someone would discover his closely guarded secret. He was attracted to boys.

Instinctively, he knew that being gay was simply not acceptable in his community. “It was very obvious that I was different by many standards in this country – and what you consider effeminate,” he said, adding that it was “made very clear” to him that that was not appropriate.

Murray said over time, his effeminacy was explained away as a consequence of being academically gifted. But as he entered adolescence, it became increasingly difficult to hide his attraction to boys.

One experience that fueled his fear, he said, was learning about a boy in his school whose diary was found with confessions of same-sex attraction. “There was a mob formed to beat him,” Murray said, adding that teachers had to intervene to protect the student and he had to be moved to a new school.

At 17, Murray’s family discovered he was in a gay relationship and threatened to evict him. He understood, he said, the challenge they faced at the time, particularly his mom. “She operated from a space of fear … the last thing you want to hear is that [your son] is gay because that’s a source of personal embarrassment,” he said.

Murray was able to work things out with his mom, who he said is now his biggest supporter. But in addition to the risks of violence and community ostracism, he had to contend with the fact that his identity could make him a criminal because in Jamaica “buggery” – the term used to describe anal sex – is illegal.

Today, as executive director at the Equality for All Foundation and senior Caribbean associate for the Human Dignity Trust, two LGBTQ+ rights organisations, Murray is one of many activists across the Caribbean who are fighting to remove such prohibitions.

And they are concerned about the recent outcome of an appeal against a 2018 high court judgment in Trinidad and Tobago to remove the country’s “buggery law” passed in 1925 under British rule. Last month Trinidad’s supreme court upheld the government’s appeal against the 2018 ruling and recriminalised the act.

Téa Braun, chief executive of Human Dignity Trust, described the outcome of the case as “very disheartening” and a regression in progress made to remove “antiquated penal codes imposed during British colonial times” that “breach the fundamental human rights of LGBT people”.

Vowing to continue his fight before the privy council in the UK, Trinidad and Tobago’s final court of appeal, Jason Jones, the LGBTQ+ activist who brought the 2018 case, told the Guardian the supreme court decision revolved around a colonial legal legacy called the “savings clause”.

Murray, who is legally trained and tutors constitutional law at the University of the West Indies, defined this as “provisions in our constitution that essentially say that if a law was in force before the constitution came into force, then you cannot challenge that law on the basis that it violates your rights”.

He said: “These are provisions that protect a lot of the colonial laws from being challenged … a lot of them came up when we were becoming independent as Caribbean countries, so that all the colonial laws were preserved and that it was up to parliament to decide when those laws were changed – rather than people going to court.”

The controversial clauses have split opinions among academics and the judiciary, with contrasting interpretations. The concern among activists is how the privy council will deal with Jones’s case.

“What I’ve noticed in the judgments that are coming out of the privy council is that they take a different approach to savings law clauses than the approach taken by the Caribbean Court of Justice [CCJ],” Murray said.

The CCJ, he said, seems to recognise “there’s a workaround, but the privy council doesn’t see it that way … and so rather than it being about how the privy council feels about LGBT rights … it’s more about how they feel about savings law clauses,” he added.

If the current judgment on the Trinidad and Tobago case is upheld by the privy council, he said, it could set a precedent with implications for the fight to remove buggery laws in Jamaica, where the privy council is also the highest court.

This, Murray believes, will hamper the progress already made in protecting the rights of LGBTQ+ people in the country. While the fight to remove discriminatory laws and discrimination is far from over, Murray said he had seen progress, such as civil service policies that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation.

He also referred to a 2023 survey by the Equality for All Foundation, which suggested “significant improvement” in the support for equality rights for LGBTQ+ people, with a 19% drop, from 69% in 2018 to 50% in 2023, in the number of people who did not support legislative changes to protect these rights.

Fellow Jamaican activist, Dane Lewis, who is the regional programme manager for the Caribbean Forum for the Liberation and Acceptance of all Genders and Sexualities, also referred to, what he saw as, a positive trend of several Caribbean countries repealing buggery laws in recent times.

But the Trinidad and Tobago case, the activists say, demonstrates the need to step up their advocacy. In addition to fighting through the courts, they are working, they said, on strategies such as encouraging political participation among LGBTQ+ people so they have a voice in decision-making, and engaging and collaborating with other minority communities.

“The fight for the rights of LGBTQ people is a fight for equality for all,” Lewis said. He added: “Our work is focused on trying to make the region as a whole a safe space for all of its people, not just those of us … who experience issues around sexual and gender diversity, but for all of us who live at the margins. So that means … persons who are from the disabled community, women from rural areas … everybody who exists at the margin should be able to enjoy the same freedoms.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/15/caribbean-activists-fight-homophobic-laws,1
The mystery of the nameless girl found dead in a Spanish border town,"Nobody can recall who first phoned the police on the morning of 4 September 1990, but everyone remembers the girl. Her body, hanging from a pine tree on a steep slope above the Spanish frontier town of Portbou, was visible to anyone looking up from the beach or across from the opposite hillside. She was barefoot, with grey-blue eyes and thick chestnut-brown hair. She wore blue dungarees over a turquoise green shirt.

Portbou, squeezed into a cauldron-like Mediterranean cove, had only 2,000 inhabitants but plenty of police officers. In these years before the Schengen agreement, guards were stationed on the French border but these officers were experts in immigration and smuggling, not violent deaths. Instead, Enrique Gómez, a 35-year-old investigator from the Guardia Civil police force was called in from the nearby city of Figueres to investigate. The phone call came as he was having breakfast in the canteen.

Carles Cereijo, an 18-year-old reporter who had just begun working with the local El Punt Avui newspaper, got to the scene before him. Cereijo had been woken by a call from a waiter friend working the breakfast shift at a cafe. He hurriedly dressed and rushed out with his camera. “I’d never seen a dead body before,” Cereijo recalled. “The police didn’t cordon off crime scenes back then. I managed to get half a metre away and thought, ‘She’s my age!’”

At 8.30am, Gómez arrived with colleagues. The scene was unchanged. A thin white cord was slung over a low branch and around the girl’s neck. Her feet dangled just half a metre above the rough ground, which was sparsely covered by hardy, wood-stemmed herbs and the spiky leaves of prickly pears. Her black sandals were close by, set neatly side by side.

It looked very much like a suicide, but there were many questions. First, how had she managed to climb the tree, tie a knot and position herself, in the middle of the night, without leaving marks on her feet or body? Then, above all, who was she? Nobody in town recognised her. But nor did any of the foreign backpackers passing through Portbou report a missing friend. She carried no ID, no passport, no money, no wallet, no train ticket. Her pockets were empty. It was as though her identity had been deliberately erased.

Yet there was something striking about the whole scene, starting with the angelic look that some perceived on the face of this wholesome-looking, clean-cut girl. “The setting was so theatrical. It left a deep impression,” said Cereijo. After an hour or so, someone placed a pink cloth over the girl’s head, which hung like a bride’s veil. Were it not such a ghastly scene, the composition may have been deemed beautiful – with the veiled girl looking out towards the bay, framed by pine trees.

Later that morning, the girl was taken down and transported by ambulance to the morgue at Figueres cemetery. Forensic doctor Rogelio Lacaci received the body. He saw no reason to question the verdict of a magistrate who deemed the death a suicide. There was no sign of violence, except for the welt left by the cord around her neck.

Lacaci performed an autopsy, which confirmed she had died by hanging. He did not test her blood for sedatives or other drugs. The girl, who seemed to have been in her late teens or early 20s, appeared to have been in good health prior to her death. Apart from a slight suntan, her skin was pale. “She was obviously from somewhere north of Spain,” recalled Lacaci. He was meticulous about photographing her clothes, which may provide some clues. Yet the tags for brands such as Rocky and Impuls revealed little: they could have been bought anywhere in Europe.

Two months passed, but the girl’s identity remained a mystery. The body was still in the morgue’s refrigerator, which was prone to malfunctioning because of sudden electricity cuts, so Lacaci decided to move her to the cemetery. First, he embalmed the corpse to ensure that it remained intact should someone claim her. She was then placed in a white body bag and lifted into niche number 134, high in one of the serried rows of square-faced compartments five storeys high bearing names of the dead that run across the cemetery. This was a space owned by the town hall and used for those whose families cannot pay for their own niches. On the front they scrawled “NN” for “no name”. Lacaci was sure that the girl was safe. If her family ever came looking, she would be easy to identify.

Over the following years, the Spanish media occasionally returned to the mystery. Later, the case featured on European websites listing missing people and unidentified bodies, which desperate relatives turned to, searching for information on their loved ones. Families came from elsewhere in Spain, as well as Germany and France, all seeking missing daughters. Fingerprints and medical records ruled them out.

In 1999, the Spanish government set up the Fénix programme, a new DNA database of missing people. This should have made identifying the Portbou girl much simpler. But when Lacaci arrived at the graveyard in 2001 to take a DNA sample, he found the niche empty. “They’ve stolen the girl!,” he protested to the local judge, but there was nothing he could do. The gravedigger had followed municipal rules, reburying her in the cemetery’s communal grave after 10 years. Her body was now mixed up with dozens of others.

Few corpses remain unidentified in Figueres. In such cases, Lacaci said, they are usually from the margins of society – sex workers, addicts or indigents far from home. The Portbou girl did not fit, he said. Like most people involved in the case – police, officials, townsfolk or journalists – he would never forget her. In 2017, the police officer turned author Rafael Jiménez even wrote a novel, imagining her story. He called it The Hanging Bride in the Land of Wind.

Carles Porta, a 61-year-old writer and film-maker, is a TV phenomenon in Catalonia. Since 2020, Porta has made a true crime show for Catalonia’s TV3, Crims, which he presents and narrates with the theatrical gravitas of a Spanish Orson Welles. Catalans love it so much that, when I last ate with Porta in a Barcelona restaurant, strangers kept coming up to introduce themselves.

Porta sources his stories from a network of old-school crime reporters and, in 2022, Tura Soler – a veteran journalist in northern Catalonia for El Punt Avui – reminded him of the Portbou girl. Three decades after her death, she remained unidentified. Soler had done her best to keep the case alive, writing regular pieces on the anniversary of the girl’s death. “I’m pretty obstinate,” Soler told me. She also sent me links to her articles. “When I heard that they were throwing out old files from the courthouse, I went running over to make sure they saved the Portbou girl documents,” she said in one.

Porta was attracted by the mystery and hoped a Crims episode on the girl might jog someone’s memory and help identify her. As Porta’s team worked, however, the story changed drastically. “Nobody had expressed any real doubt about the suicide until we interviewed Lacaci, and then it all blew up,” recalled Porta. His team showed the now retired doctor the Guardia Civil’s closeup photographs of the hanging girl that had languished, unseen, in the case file. In fact, it was the first time he had viewed the scene in detail.

Lacaci was shocked. “When I saw the photos, I said: ‘Well now, that’s impossible,’” he told me. “You have to tie the cord around the branch and then around your neck. How do you do that, while balancing on another branch in the dark? Either she learned to fly, or someone helped.” Lacaci became so obsessed that he reconstructed the scene in his home, using pieces of wood and his staircase. He decided it couldn’t be done.

When I visited Portbou on a cold December afternoon last year, with the famously maddening tramuntana wind blowing leaves into heaps on street corners, local-born journalist Ramón Iglesias showed me around. Iglesias recalled how, when he worked in a currency exchange in the late 1980s, he sometimes met distraught backpackers who had been drugged and robbed on trains into Portbou from Italy and southern France. They would appear in his office, desperately seeking ways to receive money from their parents. Could something similar, or worse, have happened to the girl?

Lacaci had a different theory. What if she had been hanged by someone else, but as part of some macabre game, or an initiation ceremony that had gone wrong? The pine tree was within a stone’s throw of the town’s white-walled, hilltop cemetery, which overlooks the sea – a suitable spot, he suggested, for such a ritual. More importantly, there were no signs of a struggle. Given the steep, rough terrain and the narrow set of 20-odd concrete steps that had to be climbed to get there, it would have been impossible to drag the girl there, unless she was unconscious or semi-conscious. “Even then it would take four or five people,” according to another forensic doctor, Narcis Bardalet, who used to alternate shifts with Lacaci and recalls seeing the girl in the morgue. Lacaci now also found it highly suspicious that she displayed none of the signs of having climbed a tree: “Nothing under her fingernails, or on her legs or feet or knees – no marks or scratches.”

When Gómez, the Guardia Civil officer, had arrived at the scene on that September morning in 1990, he found some young Austrian campers curled up in sleeping bags about 30 metres from where the body was found. He woke them, demanded their IDs and showed them the hanging girl. “Is she a friend?” Gómez asked. The group protested they didn’t recognise her. It seemed extremely unlikely that a murderer, or a group of them, would hang someone from a tree and then go to sleep nearby. After being quizzed at the local police station they were let go. Deeply shaken, they squeezed into their red Volkswagen T3 van and headed south.

In his zeal to solve the mystery, Porta asked his team to find the Austrians – but three decades after the event, the only one they could track down, Peter Treinbenreif, did not recall much beyond reaching Portbou very late at night, and the trauma of their early morning encounter. Porta turned to the Austrian broadcaster ATV, which ran a short segment on the mystery girl on 23 April 2022. Porta hoped that this may persuade the other Austrian campers to come forward.

By chance, an Italian woman holidaying with relatives in Austria saw the show. The following day she sent an email to ATV, mentioning a young Italian girl, Evi Rauter, who had disappeared 30 years earlier. “It was luck,” the Austrian show’s director, Benedikt Morak, told me.

The next day, Morak contacted Cristina Rauter, the owner of a film location company in Florence, Italy. Rauter was driving a client into the Alps when her phone rang. Morak spoke to her in German, since most people in Italy’s South Tyrol, where the Rauters are from, are bilingual. “Do you have a sister named Evi?” he asked.

Rauter, shaken and somewhat sceptical, kept driving. In the 32 years since her sister Evi had disappeared, she had received many false tips. If Morak sent pictures, she said she would look at them later.

The last time Cristina Rauter saw her sister Evi was on Monday 3 September 1990. Cristina, who was then a 23-year-old economics student, had breakfast with Evi, aged 19, in her Florence apartment before heading to the university library. Evi had come to stay a few days earlier as part of her holiday between finishing school and starting an office job near their home town of Lana, in the mountainous Italian province of South Tyrol. Evi was not sure what she wanted to study at university, so the job was part of a gap year while she worked it out. Earlier in the summer, she had travelled to Ireland for 10 days with two high school friends.

In Cristina’s memory, there was nothing strange about Evi that morning, and the sisters joked around as they always did. “She was calm, with no signs of sadness or depression, just wanting to enjoy the last few days of summer,” Cristina told me. Evi had recently spotted a cut-price purple swimsuit and spent most of her pocket money on it. A few days earlier, she and Cristina had argued about hitchhiking after Evi claimed it was a great way to travel. That was not something young women did alone, Cristina told her. Apart from that, “everything was normal”, Cristina said when we met outside the same apartment block last summer. Before leaving, Cristina handed her a 50,000 lira note – about €25 – so she had cash for the day. Evi said she might clean the apartment or visit Siena, the medieval Tuscan town 45 miles south.

When Rauter returned at lunchtime, there was a yellow Post-it note on the table with a scribbled message. “I felt like going to Siena, so I’ll be back later,” it read. The coach and rail stations were a 15-minute bus ride away, safely through the city centre. Rauter figured it would take her sister about two hours to reach Siena by bus or train, and the same to return. She expected Evi to walk through the door that afternoon or evening. Hours went by, day turned to night, but she did not appear.

Evi was cool-headed, organised and friendly. “Very respectful,” said her sister. “A good person.” She was not the type to suddenly go wild and change her plans, though her new enthusiasm for hitchhiking did concern Cristina. Both she and her sister were quite reserved, and they were very close. “We were best friends,” Cristina told me. “If she had problems, she talked to me.”

By 8pm, Cristina began to worry. By 10pm she was panicking. She stayed by the phone, hoping Evi would call to explain that she had missed the last train, or had gone elsewhere. It never rang. That night, she barely slept, staring at her sister’s empty bed. The next morning, she reasoned that Evi would be on the first train, or that the phone would ring. Then she called her parents in Lana. Her father, Herman, spent until daybreak at the railway station in nearby Bolzano, hoping his daughter had decided to come home. “Our horror film began,” said Cristina.

She rang hospitals in Siena and Florence. Evi had left her bags and even her sunglasses behind, but she had taken her house keys, Casio watch, student rail discount card and ID card. If there had been an accident, Evi should have been easily identified. Police told Cristina she had to wait 48 hours before reporting her sister as a missing person. Torn between going out to search and sitting by the phone (mobile phones were not yet common), she cycled in panic around Florence, hoping to run into Evi on the street.

At 9am the next morning, she was finally able to report her sister missing. She gave the police a full description – a teenage girl with thick chestnut hair, wearing jean dungarees, a green shirt and a Casio watch. It was exactly the description that, two countries and almost 600 miles away by road or rail, the Guardia Civil was writing into its reports on the mystery Portbou girl.

Evi’s family plastered Florence, Siena and railway stations across Italy with posters. Cristina and her parents, Herman and Karolina – an engineer and a secretary – gave interviews to newspapers and television programmes. In TV interviews, Cristina came across as a poised and sensible young woman from a middle-class family, earnestly explaining why her sister would never just run away.

The family went back to the police continually, asking for information. Newspapers and TV shows speculated wildly, and painfully, about whether Evi had run off with a secret boyfriend, perhaps an immigrant. Cristina was offended at the implication: in her home, there would be no reason for keeping such a relationship secret.

The search and the wait took their toll. Police seemed to suspect that Evi had disappeared willingly. Cristina was plunged into a world of speculation and anguish. Had she missed something? Had Evi been kidnapped by people traffickers? Did she hitchhike on her own? Could Cristina have done something to prevent her disappearance? Then there was the guilt. She wondered whether she should have stayed at home that fateful morning, rather than going to the university. “The first two or three years were very difficult,” she said. Even decades later, she or her parents would catch a glimpse of a girl who looked like Evi in the street.

Over the years, Cristina thought up elaborate fantasies that kept her hopes at what she calls “one per cent”: that Evi fell into the sea, was rescued and ended up far away; or suffered some kind of blackout; or decided to start a new life in a distant land. “Maybe she’s in Brazil or somewhere and will come back one day and suddenly the [door] bell is ringing.” But her mind told her a completely different story: “Something had happened somewhere between Florence and Siena. She’s somewhere in a forest and she’s dead.”

In 2011, 21 years after she went missing, the family applied to have Evi declared officially dead. In November 2012, the court finally posted the brief announcement in Italy’s Gazzetta Ufficiale. It offered a partial form of closure that stopped the regular flow of letters – voting slips, reminders for medical check-ups, and so on – landing in her parents’ postbox.

“You do not forget, of course,” Cristina said. “But you have to learn to live with it, or you go mad.”

As she continued driving into the mountains, Cristina tried to process the information she had been given in the phone call. Was the caller playing a cruel joke? Later that day, high up in the snow-clad Alps, she downloaded the photos, squinting at the small screen on her phone and wondering if they had been Photoshopped. “I recognised the clothes,” she said. “But it could still be fake.”

It took her two days to study the photographs properly on a computer. The pictures Lacaci had taken of Evi’s clothes sealed it. Her mother recognised her underwear with the words “touch me now” printed on the elastic. “I bought that in Lana,” she said. That was a painful moment for Cristina.

Looking closer at the images, Cristina was struck by the expression, in death, on her sister’s face. “It seems like an angel is there. She is quite happy. It’s strange, as if she’s on drugs or something.” (Spanish police did not test for drugs in 1990. “Maybe we should have,” admitted Gómez, who still believes it was a suicide.) And then there was the dramatic setting. “I mean the tree, the panorama, the cemetery, the position, the symmetry,” said Cristina. “That’s not possible to do unless you know the place and are thinking about all those things. For me it’s like a scene from a film. It’s not normal.”

The strange serenity of the scene did nothing to soften the emotional pain. “It’s a mixture of shock and tragedy,” Cristina said. But having some kind of resolution to the mystery that had haunted them “was important, for me and also for my parents”.

The peace of knowing that Evi really had died, and where, was soured by an invasion of journalists, who drove her parents to leave their house in Lana. The case sparked Facebook groups and speculative YouTube videos. Cristina stopped answering her phone.

The discovery of the Portbou girl’s identity also threw up questions, chief of which was: was Evi murdered? “We now know the end, but nothing else,” said Cristina, who believes there was foul play. “Between my front door and the tree, we do not know anything.”

There were many reasons for suspecting murder. How, instead of travelling 45 miles south to Siena, did Evi travel 600 miles north and then west, crossing the borders of France and Spain – two countries she had never visited? What happened to her ID, money and railcard? How, in the middle of the night, had she found the pine tree and climbed the narrow, steep concrete steps leading up towards it? Why would a girl who had just bought herself a new swimsuit, who was about to start a new life, choose to take her own life, in such a public and dramatic fashion, so far from home?

Evi had been found after daybreak, about 22 hours after saying goodbye to her sister. It takes 10 straight hours to drive from Florence to Portbou, which leaves little space for hitchhiking – though her sister considers it a reasonable explanation. If she travelled by rail, Evi could have caught a 13.15 train from Florence and changed at Pisa to a Portbou-bound train due to arrive at 5.45am. Yet that would require her to be firmly set on leaving Italy with the equivalent of about €55 in her pocket.

Portbou is small: it takes just 10 minutes to walk from the railway station to the pine tree by the cemetery. Evi could have been there before sunrise. But then what happened? A woman from an apartment block close by claimed to have heard loud voices and a girl crying out in the night. But it wasn’t unusual to hear shouting and strange noises in the summer, when the beach was full of partying backpackers. “Portbou was a fiesta every night,” said Bardalet, the forensic doctor.

The Austrians camping near the tree bedded down in the dark long before Evi could have reached the spot from the station. They did not see or hear anyone in the night. Whatever may have happened, they slept through it. I managed to speak to two of them. Michael Fuhs is now a musician. “I recall this policeman waking me up and then he took maybe 10 steps and I was standing in front of this girl,” Fuhs told me. “I was very suddenly very awake.” The group were mostly childhood friends and members of a Vienna band, Emerald Beyond, which had a loyal following. They often drove south to Spain or Portugal and already knew Portbou, which was why some of them chose to sleep near the cemetery and away from the bustle of the beach. It felt like a private spot, Fuhs said, and not one that a newcomer would have found easily in the dark.

In June 2022, two months after Evi was identified, Italian police – on the recommendation of a court pathologist – opened a murder investigation. But Spanish courts refused to reopen the case. A murder in Spain, if that is what it was, has a statute of limitations attached that means nobody can be charged with the crime after 20 years. Even so, Cristina had not given up hope of finding at least some of the answers she sought.

Cristina flew to Spain on 11 May 2022, less than three weeks after she had received the phone call that solved, at least in part, the mystery of Evi’s disappearance. Cristina was taken by Porta’s team of journalists to Portbou to see what she soon dubbed “the odious” pine tree, fighting contradictory emotions of horror and curiosity. She met Lacaci, Gómez and others who had been involved in the case. In video footage of the encounters, she looks perplexed and pained.

“When you saw the body hanging there like a sack, what impression did you have? Did it seem natural?” she asked Gómez.

“There was no sign that she had been attacked,” he replied.

Almost two years later, in January 2024, Cristina returned privately to Portbou. Without company or cameras, she wanted to “feel the feelings” that came from being there. Wandering around town, she found it strangely suspended in time, full of closed shops with 1990s signage that had gone out of business after the Schengen agreement came into force and internal EU border controls disappeared. A high-speed rail line that bypassed the town had delivered the final blow in 2010. The cavernous railway station was empty, there were few people in the streets and the smart mansions that once belonged to prosperous customs agents were decaying. “It seems that when Evi went there, the town also died,” she said.

Cristina also decided to ask permission to dig up the common grave area at Figueres cemetery to seek her sister’s remains. Since Evi had been embalmed, the corpse should be intact, making it easy to find – if they knew roughly where she had been placed. Cristina wanted, above all, to bring her sister home for a proper burial, but she secretly hoped more clues may emerge if Evi’s body was disinterred.

It took her many months to grind a path through the Spanish bureaucracy. Dates were repeatedly set, and then postponed. In the meantime, the Italian police investigation failed to come up with anything new and was closed. “They call it a crime without a suspect,” Cristina said.

Finally, permission came through to dig for Evi’s body. In December last year, I stood beside Cristina in the chilly cemetery as a light drizzle fell and a small red mechanical digger scooped up mounds of soil. The Figueres town hall had closed the cemetery for two days. Police guarded the gate. Lacaci was there. So, too, were Gómez, the Guardia Civil officer, Bardalet, the other forensic doctor and the journalists Tura Soler and Carles Porta, whose team flew a drone overhead to film the process. Bardalet, wearing a felt trilby, purple latex gloves and carrying an umbrella, was in charge, accompanied by a white-overalled archaeologist. A small cheroot cigar was clamped between his teeth.

The location for where to search had been identified by the gravedigger, who inherited his role from his father. But Figueres does not have a single communal grave. Instead, holes have been dug in several grass plots. “They’ll have to dig the whole place up,” said Lacaci.

An hour after digging began, there was a flurry of excitement as the first bones were discovered. When we broke for lunch in a restaurant for workers at a nearby industrial estate, Bardalet told me they had found bits from several bodies – none of which were Evi. An embalmed body was very different from the fractured, decomposing skeletons being discovered. It should have remained whole, and still be in its white bag.

They dug again that afternoon and the following day. Under the freezing rain, onlookers stamped their feet or wandered off to find somewhere warm for coffee. Gradually, the digger turned a waist-high trench into a massive hole. Shards of bone from about 200 corpses were picked from the soil and placed in boxes, but the body they sought never appeared. Evi’s mystery had not just gone to the grave with her: the grave itself now seemed to be missing. “It’s always been as if this girl was just beyond our reach,” said Bardalet.

At the end of the first day, I sat with Cristina in a cafe drinking hot chocolate during a power cut. She was angry at how many mistakes had been made. On the day Evi was found, no forensic doctors had gone to the scene. The photographs of the scene had never been shown to Lacaci. Evi’s watch and shoes, which may have provided clues about where she had been, had disappeared, along with the cord around her neck. No DNA had been taken. And now her sister’s body was lost. “Everything seems incredible,” she told me.

Cristina had not told her parents she was back in Figueres. She did not want to worry them further. She had already asked me not to contact them, since the earlier press attention had proved so stressful. She eventually told them at Christmas and said this meant it was now a closed matter for the family. Yet she also still hoped that somebody, somewhere may reveal the secret of what had happened – perhaps someone who had met Evi during her journey, whether by train or hitchhiking. “Maybe, before dying, they will think they have to say something,” she said.

The youngest of the onlookers in the graveyard was the mayor of Portbou, Gael Rodriguez, a 20-year-old representative of the socialist party. He had been elected in 2023, when he was studying law and working in his parents’ bar. After Evi’s story featured on Porta’s show, the town began attracting visitors looking for the pine tree. “I was constantly being asked where it was,” Rodriguez said. It was now a bigger lure than the memorial to Walter Benjamin, the Jewish thinker who had fled Nazi Germany and died in Portbou. (His death in 1940 was also first thought to have been a suicide. In recent years, some have argued that he may have been killed.)

These new tourists were evidence of a communal, morbid interest in the case, but they had done more than just gawk. They had turned the place where Evi was found into a monument.

When I visited, there were candles and flowers at the base of the pine tree. “This is a memorial to Evi Rauter,” read a hand-painted plaque. “And to all those people with no name.”

Before Cristina left for Florence, she and Rodriguez agreed to erect a proper sculpture in Portbou’s graveyard. It, too, will honour not just Evi, but the nameless dead.

‘Baseball was their glue’: Jackie Robinson’s deep bond with LA’s Japanese Americans,"Everyone from Jackie Robinson’s home town has a story about the baseball legend. Stick around long enough in his southern California neighborhood and Jackie’s name will bubble up in a story about a distant relative who once struck out the future Hall of Famer on a dusty field that now bears his name. Over the years, these stories gather layers – part memory, part myth – until they sound like hometown folklore.

George Ito was one of those storytellers. A second-generation Japanese American who grew up in Pasadena, California, a few doors down from the Robinson family, George loved to remind his children about his friendship with Jackie. On jogs with his son, Steven Ito, he would rattle off tales of all the times he outran his legendary friend.

“Did I ever tell you about the time I beat Jackie Robinson in a tennis match?” he’d ask.

“Many times,” Steven would reply, his voice dripping with skepticism.

In 1986, at George’s funeral, members of the Robinson family made a surprise appearance. The gesture revealed what George’s stories only hinted at: the Robinson and the Ito families were more than one-time neighbors – they were lifelong friends. Through the Great Depression and the second world war, when Japanese Americans were forced to leave their homes for incarceration camps, the Robinsons stood by their side.

Turns out, George’s stories were true, said Steven, 77. Many Japanese Americans from Pasadena have similar stories about the Robinsons. They were the kind of family that showed generosity and neighborliness.

Before Jackie made history for breaking the racial barrier in Major League Baseball and cemented himself as a sports icon, he and his older brother Mack Robinson formed deep bonds with Japanese American families – a legacy forged in an era of restrictive housing covenants. That quiet solidarity, some say, is as enduring as Jackie’s home-run legacy.

“That was the essence of the Robinsons,” said Edward Robinson, 58, Mack’s son. “We looked into the community and tried to always uplift.”

‘Baseball was their glue’

In the aftermath of Pearl Harbor, fear and suspicion swept across the US as the government ordered the incarceration of more than 120,000 Japanese Americans. Many residents thought it was an unjust act, said Susie Ling, an associate professor of history and Asian American studies at Pasadena City College. There are many documented cases of people who during this time asked themselves: what can I do to help my friend?

Few of those stories, however, involved world-class athletes.

The Pasadena of Mack and Jackie’s youth was a multicultural enclave, said Wayne Robinson, 68, Mack’s son. Especially in parts of north-west Pasadena, where racially restrictive housing covenants confined most residents of color. This is where the Robinsons put down roots in 1922. Their home at 121 Pepper Street anchored a tight-knit block.

A little over two miles away, Shigeo “Shig” Takayama lived at 310 Green Street. Shig, a second-generation Japanese American, often walked home from school with Jackie and his siblings, said Joan Takayama-Ogawa, Shig’s niece. For an after-school snack, they collected free misshapen potato chips from a nearby factory.

During the war, while Shig and his older brother served in the US military, their father, Shichitaro Takayama, was incarcerated at Gila River in Arizona. In the family’s absence, neighbors including the Robinson family helped care for the Takayama home. Facing mass incarceration, many Japanese American families turned to their neighbors to help safeguard their properties. Many were betrayed. Hasty promises were broken. Some properties were robbed or vandalized.

In Pasadena, the Takayama home remained pristine.

“It was as if they walked out one day and then after world war two, came back home,” said Takayama-Ogawa, 70. She credits the Robinsons and other neighbors who stepped in to care for the property during the family’s forced absence.

Shig and Jackie’s friendship was forged out of the love of baseball. They played on the same high school team and again at Pasadena Junior College (now called Pasadena City College), where Shig – a scrappy third baseman just over five feet tall – stayed an extra year just to share the field with his friend.

“I was just lucky to play with him,” said Shig about Jackie in a 2003 interview. “I really enjoyed him. He was really a nice person.”

Despite his small stature, Shig could hit with power and run with speed, said Kerry Yo Nakagawa, founder of the Nisei Baseball Research Project.

“Baseball was their glue,” said Nakagawa, 70, about Shig and Jackie.

The families’ friendship created cultural transmissions – especially through food. For years, the Takayama family ate black-eyed peas and collard greens on top of white rice.

“To me, that tells me more about the relationships and community relationships than anything,” said Takayama-Ogawa.

That solidarity extended beyond Pasadena. In 1937, while traveling with the team for a baseball game in Fresno, Shig and Jackie were denied hotel rooms because of their race. The hotel staff set up two cots in a broom closet instead.

The two friends bunked side-by-side, then got up the next morning and played ball.

‘You would defend your friends. That’s all you had’

On Pepper Street, the neighborhood kids formed a tight-knit friend group. In Jackie’s own words from his 1972 autobiography, I Never Had It Made, the group had a name – the Pepper Street Gang.

“Our gang was made up of Blacks, Japanese, and Mexican kids,” said Jackie in his book. “All of us came from poor families and had extra time on our hands.”

The ragtag group didn’t fit into the modern definition of a gang. They were just a group of neighborhood friends, said Kathy Robinson-Young, 66, Mack’s daughter.

George Ito, who lived at 273 Pepper Street, often recalled how the gang felt like a band of brothers.

After school, if the Robinson siblings were chased home by rock-throwing kids, they would run to Ito’s house and mount their defense.

The Pepper Street Gang held regular evening meetings, George told his family. Each meeting always started with a ritual: every kid would share the best thing that happened to them that day.

It almost sounds too wholesome to be true.

“That’s why it was kind of hard for me to believe when I first heard the story, right?” said Steven.

But for a group of kids of color growing up in Depression-era Pasadena, it was a deliberate act of optimism – a survival tactic disguised as a childhood routine.

“It’s a testament to what friendship really meant back then,” said Steven. “Even though you would get in the middle of this kind of hatred, it didn’t matter. You would defend your friends. That’s all you had.”

The Pepper Street Gang eventually disbanded. Most members are dead. Mack remained in Pasadena and became a tireless community advocate for youth and civil rights until he died in 2000. Jackie’s legacy, of course, towers over baseball history.

But to those who knew the Robinsons – and those whose families lived on the same block – it’s these quieter stories that reveal the fuller picture.

‘The last thread connecting people to services’: why vets are risking all to care for Gaza’s donkeys,"It felt like an “earthquake from the sky” when an Israeli airstrike hit the clinic Dr Saif Alden had left just minutes earlier. Alden had been treating animals hurt and abandoned amid Gaza’s destruction. They survived but the equipment and medication the mobile clinic needed to function was destroyed.

Still, the team saw it as a setback, not a defeat. Alden has spent the month since the airstrike traversing Gaza to scavenge the tools needed to resume operations.

“It was a test of our purpose, our mission and our resilience,” says Alden, team leader for a mobile clinic run by the charity Safe Havens for Donkeys. “It was a miracle that we survived.

These donkeys are the last thread connecting people to the basic services they desperately need

“And survival wasn’t the end of the story – it was just the beginning of another struggle. The attack took from us all the tools we use to save lives.

“We’ve started again, from zero, because the animals are still here. They still need us. And we will never abandon them.”

Alden’s team operates a mobile clinic that has treated more than 7,000 donkeys and thousands of other animals since the outbreak of the current war in Gaza in October 2023. Donkeys are a lifeline for many Palestinians in Gaza.

Israel’s bombardment has decimated Gaza’s infrastructure, destroying roads and leaving few functioning vehicles, while its blockade of the Palestinian territory makes fuel for transport difficult to find.

Donkeys have filled the gap, used to transport goods and people – as they search daily for food, water and fuel, to get to hospitals and to transport them with their belongings each time Israeli forces order thousands to leave an area.

“These donkeys are the last thread connecting people to the basic services they desperately need,” says Alden.

“We’ve seen donkeys in Gaza who’ve saved lives – transporting pregnant women to hospitals to give birth, carrying the injured to safety, standing by the side of those who have lost everything, offering warmth when all else is cold. They give without asking for anything in return.”

The Safe Haven team have continued to work despite the airstrike on 13 March, and other challenges before that including near-misses, roadblocks and the struggle to find food or shelter.

The mobile clinic travels across Gaza, stationing itself in different areas on appointed days so those with wounded animals can bring them for treatment.

But the team also scours the destroyed landscape for those animals left behind, takes calls from the owners of ailing and injured donkeys, and responds to requests to rescue animals from even the most dangerous areas.

The treatment process is a careful one: each animal is sensitively approached and assessed then given the correct treatment, whether for a wound, a broken limb or malnutrition. Finally, they wait and hope the animal can recover with their limited resources.

Alden says they go through a personal journey with each animal, which involves offering each one sensitivity and dignity after the traumas it would have experienced. And while it relies on science, the little equipment they have to heal the animals means the team also depend on sheer willpower.

“When they get better, we don’t celebrate – they aren’t trophies. We quietly stand by their side, just as we have been standing by every other animal we’ve helped. But inside, a part of us whispers a prayer of gratitude,” says Alden.

“When we help them, we are not simply saving a life; we are preserving a sacred bond between humans and animals. We are keeping hope alive.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/apr/15/palestinians-gaza-save-haven-for-donkeys-charity-veterinary,1
‘Ozempic arrived and everything changed’: plus-size models on the body positivity backlash,"In 2021, Skye Standley was considered one of modelling’s rising stars. With her beautiful face, curves and distinctive red hair, she was in demand: she appeared in advertising campaigns for Dolce & Gabbana, the Danish label Ganni and Rihanna’s brand Savage X Fenty. Last year, she was appearing in roundups of ones to watch, alongside established “curve” or plus-size models – typically a size 12 and above – such as Ashley Graham and Paloma Elsesser, who were predicted to be “everywhere”. In reality, it was one of her toughest years.

“The past two years have been really challenging,” says Standley. “I think there’s been a lot of erasure all around. I’ve noticed a lot less work.” She only worked a couple of times last year, she says, “compared with the two years before, where I was working continuously. I’ve definitely noticed, when it comes to [London] fashion week, there being no castings, and throughout the year, just a lot of regression, even from brands I’ve worked with. I spent all of last year trying to find a way to navigate everything that was changing with the industry.” Just over three weeks ago, Standley left her agency.

For all the strides the body positivity movement has made over the past decade, including within the fashion industry, there have been signs that the thin ideal was always going to make a comeback. You can blame the “wellness” culture that idealises thinness, or the return of 90s fashion, and the “heroin chic” bodies that wore it. Blame the rise of weight-loss injections such as Ozempic, or the way fashion tends to swing back and forth. Or blame the demonisation of “wokeness” and diversity initiatives by conservatives. Or, blame it all, along with the fatphobia that never really went away, even though it pretended to. Models, activists and those of us who had hoped that fashion’s embrace of a range of sizes signified a genuine culture change are left wondering how it could have reversed so quickly. “I think you’re seeing the separation between people that were doing it because there was a movement at the time,” says Standley, “and the people who are truly passionate about it.”

When fashion did embrace larger bodies, “it kind of felt like the Renaissance,” says the model Tess Holliday, “like we were going into this beautiful period where we were at a new awakening. I don’t want to say it’s plateaued – it hasn’t. It’s really gone downhill so quickly. A shift that has left me and so many of my colleagues just feeling really disheartened.” Holliday, who has modelled for labels such as Chromat and appeared on the cover of Cosmopolitan, has noticed her work dropping off, but says she was moving away from modelling anyway (her book for young people, Take Up Space Y’all, is out later this year). “To see such a drastic slide back, it really does make you feel like the progress didn’t matter, but I know that’s just what society wants me to say and feel, and I refuse to give in to that. But do I have moments where I sit around and feel like perhaps I was one of a handful of people that were used to make it seem like people cared? Yeah, maybe sometimes.”

Felicity Hayward, a model and activist, thinks 2023 was a turning point. “Ozempic arrived into our industry, and there was a definite change,” she says. Hayward, who has modelled for Mac and appeared on the cover of i-D magazine, monitors the number of designers using curve models across the fashion weeks in London, Paris, New York and Milan for her report Inside the Curve. At first the drop was slow, but this season, she says, “we’ve started to see a huge decline. New York, which had 70 plus-size models in 2023, had 23 earlier this year. At the September 2024 London fashion week, 80 plus-size models were on the runway, but just 26 this year.” Of these, 17 were used by Sinéad O’Dwyer (without her show, London would have had the fewest). The designer Karoline Vitto, whose models are diverse, didn’t hold a runway show. Milan, says Hayward, never really embraced size inclusivity (just 10 looks were worn by plus-size models at the February shows), and Paris had 22. “I thought, naively maybe, we had come to a place now where women’s bodies in particular had stopped being criticised,” she says, “and we were just accepting everybody for who they are.”

She started monitoring inclusion to hold designers accountable. “It’s all well and good us seeing a curve model on a runway and automatically thinking that that brand is suddenly size-inclusive, when actually you need the stats – it could be the next season they don’t use curve at all, which is kind of what happened.” Or, if they do, she says, they are using fewer, or they are “mid-size” – UK size 12 to 16 – rather than plus-size. Many models have lost weight, says Hayward. “The girls who used to be a size 16 or 18 are now size 12. It’s really difficult because, on one hand, I don’t want to speak about women’s bodies, but if the only plus-size representation we have are also losing weight, it does feel like the whole industry is turning their back on us.” The latest size inclusivity survey by Vogue Business found similar data – at 198 fashion shows earlier this year, just 12 designers used plussize models. The report also noted that of the mid-size models used, it tended to be “the same two or three faces”. The celebration of a handful of mid-size models – in 2023, Precious Lee, Jill Kortleve and Paloma Elsesser were declared “the new Supers” on the cover of British Vogue – hasn’t translated into a wider acceptance.

In 2021, the model and activist Nyome Nicholas-Williams was working a lot (she has worked for brands such as Adidas, H&M and the activewear company Lululemon). “I was never getting booked more in my life. It was amazing,” she says. Although there are still brands Nicholas-Williams works for repeatedly, in the last couple of years, there has been a drop in other work; she has increasingly worked as a hand model, and she’s now also looking for a part-time job. It has affected her financially, and had an impact on her mental health. “I’m tired from all the fighting, just to have clothes that fit, or brands and designers actually wanting to put out clothes that plus people can wear.”

Even when brands appeared to embrace size inclusivity, Nicholas-Williams says she was pessimistic that they would stick to it. “I was, like, this is going to be something that’s for a short period, and then we’re going to go back to how it was. I didn’t think it would be this soon, and so overtly.” If larger models are used, she says, they tend to be mid-size, rather than the bigger sizes used in the past. She has observed plus-size models lose weight to get more work. “I think there is a pressure,” she says, though she adds it’s not something she would do. “I would never lose weight for a brand to hire me, because I don’t want to change myself for them, because then you don’t want me authentically as myself.”

Standley also feared the move towards inclusivity wouldn’t last. “When you’re actually on the sets and you’re having certain experiences that are not good, you can see through a lot of it,” she says. “Things don’t fit, and things are not always great, and you need to work three times as hard to make it work. You push through because you want to get something good out of it.”

And a lot of good did come out of it, she says. “It helped to energise people and get more people a platform and exposure.” For the models themselves, and activists working for inclusivity, it brought a sense of community. For the rest of us, including anyone who has ever struggled with their weight, or felt they didn’t fit the body ideal – and with the average UK dress size a 16, that’s a lot of women – it felt good to see different bodies represented and celebrated. “I think it has inspired some designers and some people that do want to still keep pushing,” says Standley. “Those are the good things that came out of it. But I do feel, especially now, a lot of it was and is performative.” And performative attitudes, she says, are easily abandoned.

I get shouted at just as much on the street as I used to. I didn’t see a decrease in animosity Brigitte Read

“I also think, from what I’ve observed in the industry, it tends to be a domino effect,” she says. Just as brands copied each other, not wanting to be left out – or worse, called out – by not including plus-size models, now they’re chasing each other the other way. “Now that regression has taken place, it seems like everyone has just followed.” Ultimately, says Standley, the fashion industry always prizes thinness, and possibly always will. “Most of the industry is deeply rooted in a lot of fatphobia and that was maybe put to the side for a proportion of time, but now that things have settled, and people are back to how they really want to be, it’s really just accepted.”

Worse, it seems to some working in this area that the backlash has been huge. “One of the things I’ve noticed is the amount of hate and abuse I have received online has skipped back to pre-2016 levels, when that sort of hate towards bigger bodies was kind of the norm,” says Hayward. “I didn’t really expect it.” Last month, the clothing brand Snag told the BBC it was getting more than 100 complaints a day that the models it uses are too fat, and were employing staff just to remove negative and hateful comments on its social media pages. But, Brigitte Read, Snag’s founder, isn’t convinced this is a new thing. “Honestly, I don’t think attitudes ever really changed to be more positive. When you look at the kind of hatred that you see in the comments, and overall on the internet, and myself as a fat person – I get shouted at just as much on the street now as I used to – I didn’t personally see a decrease in that level of animosity.”

Emma Matell, known as one of the fashion industry’s most inclusive casting directors, says she worries about the plus-size models whose careers she has helped develop, from those she has scouted to those she regularly casts in shows and advertising campaigns. “It’s really sad to see that they don’t get the bookings they deserve.” Matell often works with O’Dwyer, one of the few designers who actively promotes diverse casting. In the past, O’Dwyer has used friends and family in her shows, but for her show at London fashion week in February, they took a more traditional path. “We really focused on booking models, because there were barely any shows that book curve models,” says Matell. “It felt important to highlight that there are amazing curve models that are not working.”

View image in fullscreen Holliday: ‘It felt like the Renaissance, but it’s gone downhill so quickly.’

Even during the time more diverse models were being employed, there were frustrations. Matell might want to cast a plus-size model in a magazine shoot, for instance, and so would the stylist and editor, but frequently would find there weren’t the clothes samples from designers to fit them. “Which is why a lot of the time when you see imagery of curve models, they’re not ever fully dressed.” Sometimes this is to make a statement about their body, she acknowledges, “but it’s also just because there simply aren’t enough clothes available for those models”.

Even if there hasn’t been a huge revolution towards size inclusivity, Matell thinks some progress has been made. Consumers saw themselves reflected, and she hopes people will demand more of that from brands. “Whether or not the brands are choosing to take steps back, I think that’s going to come back in their face when their consumer is saying: ‘Why am I suddenly no longer part of your brand when you were preaching that two years ago?’ I do think there is a generational shift coming up in who the consumer is and what they’ll demand.”

In the meantime, Standley still feels “a responsibility to represent my community” when it comes to her work. “Being over a certain dress size, larger than most plus-size models that are working, and not having a super-conventional or commercial look, I keep trying to push back and fight for change – to change the narrative on what it is to be plus size, existing in the world and also in this industry.”",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/apr/15/ozempic-arrived-and-everything-changed-plus-size-models-on-the-body-positivity-backlash,1
‘I didn’t trust the system’: lasting trauma of Windrush victim barred from UK for 10 years,"Winston Jones has worked hard to rebuild his life after Home Office errors meant he was unable to return to his family in the UK for 10 years after taking a short holiday in Jamaica in 2005, enduring a decade of near destitution and homelessness in Kingston.

Jones, 64, a former bakery manager at Sainsbury’s, has used the money he received from the Windrush compensation scheme to set up a podcast studio and music recording unit in Manchester, working with his son to create opportunities for local young people.

But he felt so traumatised by the experience of being wrongly classified as an immigration offender and locked out of the country that had been his home for 32 years that, even after the government had apologised for the Windrush scandal, he almost didn’t apply for compensation. Initially, he felt too frightened to contact the Home Office to try to get documentation proving his immigration status, because he thought there was a risk he would be arrested.

“I didn’t trust the system. I thought they were trying to trap me,” he said, explaining that he turned around and walked back to the train station as soon as he saw the words “immigration centre” above the door of the building.

His unease was justified. After 10 years of repeatedly being prevented by British officials from returning to his five children in the UK, Jones managed to fly home from Jamaica in 2015, having secured a temporary tourist visa. But even back in London, he struggled to resolve his immigration status. In 2017, a team of Border Force officers mounted a dawn raid on his daughter’s home, where he had been visiting, hoping to arrest him as an overstayer. He was elsewhere, but officers searched his grandchildren’s bedroom looking for him, terrifying the entire household.

He met the migration minister Seema Malhotra on Friday, speaking for the first time about his experiences, in an attempt to persuade more people affected by the Windrush scandal to come forward to claim compensation, as the government launches a £1.5m fund to support applicants, in recognition that many may still feel very nervous about meeting Home Office staff.

Jones was managing the bakery at a large Sainsbury’s in Winchmore Hill in north London when he decided in 2002 to go on holiday to Jamaica. He had not travelled there, or taken a flight anywhere, since leaving Kingston in 1973 as a 13-year-old to join his mother, who was working as a nurse in the children’s ward of a hospital in Stockport, and his father, who was working in the nearby iron foundries.

The first time he travelled in 2002, he experienced no difficulties; the second time, he was told he would need to get a stamp in his Jamaican passport confirming that he had the right to live in the UK. When he tried to do this at the Home Office’s Croydon headquarters in 2005 before a third visit, an official told him he wasn’t on the computerised system. Jones explained that this was because he had arrived before computers were in use. A second official advised the first that he should go and search for Jones’s file in the archives.

“He said something like: ‘I haven’t got time to go to the archive,’” Jones said. (These archives were later destroyed in 2010.) Instead, Jones was told (wrongly) that he would need to visit UK consular officials in Jamaica to get the paperwork in order.

When he travelled there, he was unable to get an appointment at the High Commission during his booked holiday period. British Airways staff refused to let him board the flight home. Jones was told to stay in Kingston to try to get a stamp in his passport, confirming that he was a returning resident. When he managed to see them, officials requested that further documentation be sent from the UK. It took several months for his marriage certificate, son’s birth certificate and his school records to be sent over. For reasons that are not entirely clear, staff told him that this was still insufficient proof and that by that point he had exceeded the number of consular appointments he was eligible for.

The British officials were “really nasty”, shouted at him and suggested he might have secured the paperwork through criminal means, he said.

He lost his job with Sainsbury’s when he was unable to return home. “They thought I had gone on holiday and just not come back, and they stopped taking my calls,” he said. His children, who were aged between two and 18 when he was first refused the right to return home, were living in Manchester, while he had been renting a flat in London. His flat was emptied and his car disappeared.

“I played sports all my life and I had about 90 trophies and certificates – boxing, cricket, badminton, football. It all went, everything I owned, except what I had in my suitcase,” he said.

He had no family in Jamaica and so was forced to sofa surf, and sometimes had to sleep on the beach with Kingston’s homeless community. “There were low times,” he said, with powerful understatement. “I tried to stay positive; I really hung on to a sense of hope that I would be able to return home one day.” His eldest daughter tried to find a lawyer who would offer affordable legal advice; after a decade, she found someone who told him to apply for a tourist visa and he was able to return. However, he was unable to regularise his status until the Windrush scandal became a political issue in 2018.

“I lost absolutely everything. Nine grandchildren were born while I was away. I missed my children’s 16th, 18th and 21st birthdays, all the important milestones. My children suffered a lot too.”

When he was stranded in Jamaica he had a recurring dream about flying home. “The plane would always crash, that was the dream I kept having for 10 years,” he told Malhotra during the minister’s visit to his Manchester studios. “When I came back on the tourist visa, which expired after six months, that dream was reversed. I dreamed every night that I was being forced to fly back. I was a fugitive for three years; I was up on my toes ready to go.”

He said victims of the scandal needed counselling as well as financial compensation for lives ruined by the Home Office’s errors.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/14/windrush-victim-barred-from-uk-for-10-years-compensation,1
"‘I’ve pulled myself out of a very dark abyss’: Garbage’s Shirley Manson on depression, sexism, dodgy hips and happiness","The new album by Garbage, Let All That We Imagine Be the Light, has the kind of sound that makes you think you have always known it. You somehow know the words as they land; you have the tune in your head on a single listen. But try saying that to the Edinburgh-born singer Shirley Manson, who – although she has lived mainly in the US for almost 30 years – is incredibly Scottish about flattery, which is to say she doesn’t like it. “I think possibly you just relate deeply to the lyrics of Chinese Fire Horse,” she says wryly, down the line from Los Angeles. That track is about life chewing you up and spitting you out because you are too old. No, I say firmly, one fiftysomething to another (she is 58), I don’t relate to that at all.

Let All That We Imagine has its roots in 2016, when Manson fell off stage on the first day of the tour for Strange Little Birds, the last album but one. “I’m not blaming myself for my physical exuberance,” she says. “I was thinking about lyrics, I was thinking about my body, and I tumbled into the security barrier. I smashed my hip pretty badly, but it took five years for it to disintegrate.”

That resulted in a hip replacement in 2023. “The physical recovery is surprisingly easy,” she says. “I mean, there’s a lot of indignity involved. I had to zoom around in a sweat suit with a walker. I’ll leave that image just there; I don’t need to embellish that.” Between the pain and the painkillers, though, she had terrible brain fog and Garbage ended up writing the album remotely, the rest of the band – Butch Vig, Duke Erikson and Steve Marker – sending her musical ideas. “I felt really isolated. My band are not communicative at the best of times, and I was completely cut off from them. The only thing I would get would be these instrumentals with some zany titles.”

Weirdly, it worked: they had an album to tour by last year, and were about to play their biggest UK gig in 15 years, at Ovo Arena Wembley, when Manson’s other hip “collapsed the day before” and she had to have that one replaced too. “It’s been very confronting. It makes you question everything, how you want to move forward in your life, particularly as I’m at this late stage in my career. It’s also been really fascinating, though, I’ve got to be honest with you – dark and depressing and soul-crushing, and also kind of wonderful.”

“That’s such a Shirley Manson thing to say,” I say.

“Oh, God, really?”

Only Happy When It Rains wasn’t technically the breakthrough Garbage single – that was Stupid Girl – but both were released in 1995 and became the soundtrack to the year: caustic, self-aware, catchy but not in a people-pleasing way. Manson herself had been, as she describes it, plucked from obscurity, on the dole in Scotland and trying to get paid to make music. “I was pretty miserable, and I got a phone call out of the blue: do you want to come and work with one of America’s most favoured sons? Before I knew it, I was off, flying to Madison, Wisconsin, working on a new record, with a brand new band, and these people I’d never met before, and it was a wild, wild experience.”

That favoured son was Vig, who, then nearly 40, was famous as the producer of Nirvana’s Nevermind and was an all-purpose big beast of alternative rock, a credited producer on Sonic Youth and Smashing Pumpkins albums. “It’s so mad,” Manson says. “In pop music terms, we were ancient when we started. I was the youngest member of the band, and I was 28, and we’re now 30 years on. That’s fucking bananas.”

That eponymous debut album could do no wrong – it sold 4m copies worldwide and went double-platinum in the US, the UK and Australia. Manson says now that: “Butch in particular was credited with all our work, even though, to his eternal defence, he went out of his way to explain that the band worked as a band.” Truthfully, though, Manson had such panache that a whole bunch of us (by “us” I mean listeners to 90s indie rock) didn’t even notice the guys and thought this was a Scottish band, a frontwoman and her friends, and couldn’t figure out why they weren’t in the UK more often. We didn’t have Google then.

“It’s funny you should say that,” she says, in a warm, you-idiot tone of voice. “As the years have progressed, I realise I don’t belong to anyone. Nobody really wants me. I’m definitely a Scottish artist, but Scotland has not really seen us as a Scottish band, and England obviously hasn’t seen us as a UK band, and then we come to America, and they think we’re some kind of transatlantic supergroup. We’ve landed nowhere, really.”

The 90s were also brutal to women in the music industry. “I was so young and I was hungry and distracted. I didn’t notice a lot of the micro-misogyny and the micro-sexism at first,” Manson says. “I was blinded by the dazzle of my career. I wasn’t paying attention. Back then, I read my own press, like a fool, and I was reading these horrible descriptions of me, really degrading or sexual in nature, or just nasty shit. It wasn’t just the male writers, although primarily the 90s music journalists were male. It really stung, and I found that hard.”

Critique was often lascivious and slavering, but any amount of objectification was supposedly fine because it was always ironic, and that, in itself, was bullshit. But it morphed into a kind of bitterness and resentment, which I never understood. People would tear into Manson – and everyone: Kenickie, Sleeper, even Salad – and I never really got where the anger came from.

“I think it goes back to the 90s offering a different kind of woman, for the first time, arguably ever in culture,” Manson says. “Liberated, mouthy, opinionated, political, also often beautiful and powerful. At first, I think they thought it was a marvellous distraction, a joyous kink. And then, all of a sudden, they” – I’m going out on a limb to say “they”, here, are the patriarchy – “were like: ‘Wait a minute, these women are getting a lot of attention and taking up a lot of column space, and we’re going to crush it.’ Subconsciously, not deliberately, I don’t think. But there was a sense of: ‘You can go back to the hole that you crawled out of. Let’s get back to real music, serious music, proper creativity, important statements and important sounds coming from the men.’”

It was a lot – endless horrible personal remarks from one direction and relentless, adulatory image-making from the other. “The problem with a lot of success is it comes with a lot of visual accompaniment. Your self is reflected back at you on every magazine. Some versions are gorgeous and fantastical and you look nothing like yourself – maybe there’s a small semblance of you in the eyes. And then there are incredibly unflattering ones … I wasn’t the right personality to deal with that. I found it repulsive. I didn’t get an iota of pleasure out of it. I felt that, if I was good enough, I would look like that image. But I don’t, so they have to augment it with lights and makeup and hair and stylists and nail manicurists. It really did a number on my self-esteem.”

In the aftermath, Manson was open about her struggles with depression and body dysmorphic disorder, but that openness was distorted in the media as fragility, which now bugs the hell out of her. “I hate the phrase ‘mental health’, as applied to me. I have a very healthy psyche. I’m pretty tough, mentally. I have definitely suffered from bouts of depression. I see that as a healthy part of existing in the world. I think it’s really necessary. I think all this nonsense about us permanently having to feel ecstatic is silly.”

She moved to the US in 1996. “Perhaps some other bands might have done well living in different continents,” she says, “but I don’t think it was on the cards for us.” By 2001, they were still flying high – Version 2.0 in 1998 had sold well, Beautiful Garbage did fine – but “we have to touch on the devastation wreaked by September 11 in the States,” she says. “That changed modern radio entirely, and one could argue it’s never really fully recovered since. Programming became really conservative: radio would only really play a certain sound – a very reassuring, unthreatening, fun vibe – and these very fierce women from the 90s just disappeared. That was when we started to see the rise of real mega-capitalist pop. We’ve been inundated with those sounds now for 20-odd years.”

Manson loves pop. She loves Taylor Swift: “People make fun of her lyrics because they talk about an experience that they’re uninterested in, a very young woman coming of age, but make no mistake, Taylor Swift is a genius.” She loves Chappell Roan: “There’s nothing better than singing along to Pink Pony Club when you’ve just come off reading the news. Get me out of here, take me away, Chappell.” Yet she still lands the point, matter-of-factly, that mainstream music has been homogenised, in a way that makes me sad. But only later – it’s hard to feel sad while you are talking to Manson.

In the mid-00s, the band went on a hiatus, cutting short the tour for their fourth album, Bleed Like Me, talking about solo projects. Manson’s mother developed dementia, and died in 2008, at which point, she says: “I was very depressed. Watching my mother die was the worst thing I’ve ever seen in my life, and my career had stalled. I had to make a choice to pull myself out and up, into my life. I just started saying to myself: ‘You are an artist. You do this for a living. You’ve done it very successfully, and you can do it again. So let’s just go and start writing music and being musical, doing the work, filling it with love and interest and passion and having an idea of where it’s going.’ I never believed I was an artist until my mother died. I felt it was her last gift to me.”

Garbage rediscovered their enthusiasm for each other and found a new way of working when they reformed in 2010, the year that Manson also married Garbage’s sound engineer, Billy Bush. Her first marriage, to the Scottish artist Eddie Farrell, had ended in 2003. “When I was young, I broke my back trying to facilitate communication in this band, and it nearly killed me. In 2012, I thought: ‘If they want this as much as I want this, we will do this together. And if they don’t want to do it, then it’s over.’ I was just going to sit and hold my own seat without having to serve the group. And I don’t have any expectations of them any more. We love each other, and if one of us goes down, the whole team is on it – we swarm to each other’s side. But other than that, we exist as four pillars, with massive space between us.”

But the 2012 album, Not Your Kind of People, was a critical but not a commercial success, the 2016 tour was an orthopaedic disaster, and the 2021 album, No Gods No Masters, explicitly political and denouncing “capitalist shortsightedness, racism, sexism and misogyny”, as she put it at the time, nearly made her “very, very ill. I managed to pull myself out of what felt like a very dark abyss. And I was driving my husband insane. He was saying: ‘You’ve got to stop this. You can’t save the world.’ And although I disagree with him – I do believe in singular action – I had to save myself.”

She describes a pre-gig ritual Garbage have had since they reformed. “We started doing it at the beginning of each show. It’s a piss-take of what all these other bands do. We look as though we’re about to high-five each other, and then we miss each other’s hands. We’ve done it for years. But now, since my surgeries, every time I do this ritual, and the hands go sailing through the air, I have a tiny pinch of: ‘Are we being the very thing we’re taking the piss out of? Or am I wanting some real connection here?’”

Just go for it, I advise. Make the authentic high-five.

“I don’t know if I’ve got the moral courage. I don’t know if it’s possible for us. Everybody’s so fucked up, it’s amazing.”

The funny thing is, there was a lot of to and fro before the interview about whether Manson would turn on her camera for our video call. She didn’t want to, and I let it drop because the aforementioned savage 90s media was bound to make a person wary. When it came to it, it was nothing to do with the 90s, she said. “I’m sorry, but I’m nude in my bedroom, and I really don’t think you would appreciate that.”

I didn’t really need to know what she looked like – I just wanted to see her expressions. But you can pretty much always hear that she is smiling.",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/apr/14/ive-pulled-myself-out-of-a-very-dark-abyss-garbages-shirley-manson-on-depression-sexism-dodgy-hips-and-happiness,1
‘The Citizen Kane of rock movies’: glam rockers Slade and their bid for cinema greatness,"Daryl Easlea was eight years old when he got the 4A bus with his mate Graham down to the Odeon in Southend-on-Sea to see his favourite rock band make the leap from vinyl to celluloid. After 12 consecutive top 10 singles – including six No 1s – Slade had finally made their first movie, Slade in Flame. It has just turned 50.

What young Easlea saw in 1975 was not the fun-packed adventures of a happy-go-lucky glam rock foursome, but a dour, downbeat film about being chewed up and spat out by the music industry. Easlea, who would grow up to be Slade’s biographer, didn’t care.

Its writer had worked on a film about Nazi Albert Speer and another about internment in Northern Ireland – it rubbed off

“You can’t underestimate how it felt to hear the word ‘piss’ when you were eight,” he says, laughing. “I know it sounds exceptionally shallow, but it felt edgy and dangerous. I didn’t understand the half of it. Films don’t usually start with two blokes having a chat in a loo – that very mundanity reached out to me. They were cheeky and sweary, and it wasn’t like seeing A Hard Day’s Night on the telly.”

Slade in Flame – which is getting rereleased in UK cinemas in May – depicted a fictional band, Flame, who are formed from two squabbling clubland bands in 1967, and attract the attention of a London-based businessman (Tom Conti) who sees the opportunity to package and sell them, as he says, like cigarettes. As they become successful, their thuggish former agent tries to reclaim them. Realising their own lack of agency, the band choose instead to split.

We don’t want to do A Hard Day’s Night. We want to show the gritty side of the business

In the process of making it, though, band and film-makers created a Black Country version of Head, the film credited with destroying the Monkees’ career, albeit one more redolent of pints of mild than tabs of acid. Just like Head, the film tanked. And just like the Monkees, Slade suffered.

“Chas Chandler, our manager, wanted us to follow in the footsteps of the Beatles,” recalls Don Powell, Slade’s drummer. “And he said, ‘How about making a movie?’ We said, ‘We don’t want to do A Hard Day’s Night. We want to show the gritty side of the business.’ But it went against us.” He says audiences got confused that “we weren’t Slade in the film, we were all playing different characters.”

To get the film made, Chandler went to Goodtimes Enterprises, headed by David – later Lord – Puttnam, which had made notably darker rock-adjacent movies such as Performance, starring Mick Jagger, and the David Essex vehicles Stardust and That’ll Be the Day. Two twentysomethings – Richard Loncraine and Andrew Birkin – were brought in to direct and write, and the pair of them were promptly packed off on tour in the US with Slade to get a feel for their subjects.

Neither were fans – Birkin had never even heard of Slade, let alone listened to them – and the experience was odd. “They never really managed to crack America, and were playing to a lot of half-empty arenas,” Loncraine says. “I remember an awful lot of dreadful tour buses.”

Birkin adds that in between listening to recordings of Hancock’s Half Hour with singer Noddy Holder – both were Tony Hancock zealots – “it became apparent that you had to base the characters in the movie around their own characters.”

“Andrew spoke to us individually for many, many hours, getting stories,” Powell says. And many of the stories passed around the circuit were re-enacted in the film: Noddy Holder getting trapped in a coffin on stage really did happen to Screaming Lord Sutch. In another set piece, the band visit a pirate radio station operating from a Maunsell Fort in the Thames Estuary. “We didn’t get any permission or anything,” Loncraine says. “We just turned up with 50 people on a boat to find these rusting ladders. We had to get Dave Hill up there and he was terrified of heights. His wig blew off.”

Also true to life, Powell says, was the way the film reflected how bands playing the same gigs would interact with each other off stage. “We always used to meet at the Caravan outside New Street station in Birmingham,” he says of the band’s days on the club circuit. “It sold hotdogs and cookies and coffees. Robert Plant would be there, John Bonham, Jeff Lynne, Justin Hayward – all with our cups of tea talking about where we’d just played.” At least one character bears a close resemblance to a real life counterpart: the agent Ron Harding even has a name notably similar to Don Arden, one of the most feared music business impresarios of the 60s and 70s.

But part of the film’s grimness came not from the band, but from Birkin. “At the time I had a very bleak view of life,” he says. Birkin had been hired by Puttnam to adapt the memoir of Albert Speer, Adolf Hitler’s architect and later armaments minister during the Third Reich, for a feature film. Speer had been released from Spandau prison in 1966, and Birkin spent 44 hours interviewing him, challenging the Nazi about his past. “I was also involved with making a film about internment in Northern Ireland. A lot of that rubbed off on me.”

It was exemplified by a scene in which Powell and his former boss go down to the local canal to discuss the meaningless of life: “It ain’t the same any more,” Powell says, asked if his dreams have come true. “Make a few records. That bit’s OK. Rest of the time it’s a bunch of bloody gangsters in dinner jackets.”

Holder was the most natural on screen, Jim Lea feels barely present, and Dave Hill is, well, Dave Hill. But Powell’s performance is remarkable because in July 1973, a severe road accident left him with acute short-term memory loss. “Don Powell was a sweet man,” Loncraine says. “Is a sweet man. In the mornings I would have to tell him what we were doing, but even who he was as well, because he couldn’t remember much about himself some mornings, or what he was doing.”

“Richard was so helpful to me,” Powell says. “He told me, ‘We only do one or two scenes a day.’ You just need to learn your lines for that scene.’ He said I didn’t have to learn the script, and we just took everything day by day.”

The film was preceded by the album of the same name, released in time for Christmas 1974. The previous two albums had topped the charts; this stalled at No 6. The first single Far Far Away reached No 2, though. Still, it was a departure for Slade – there were no glam rock bangers with misspelled titles, and in Far Far Away and the second single How Does It Feel, there was a melancholy and depth that was a million miles from Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me.

When the film was released, it was largely dismissed (though rather surprisingly, Michael Billington – who reviewed cinema for the Illustrated London News, as well as theatre for this paper – quite enjoyed it). Easlea aside, it didn’t really connect with the band’s young fans, rather inviting the question: did no one ever stop to think they should have made a film for 12-year-olds?

“I don’t remember anyone saying that. Never a single conversation about it,” Loncraine says. Powell agrees, adding: “We said we didn’t want to do a run-around, jump-around film. But it really did go against us.”

“There was some concern,” Birkin suggests. “But Chas Chandler had faith in us and he certainly liked the idea that this would be a different kind of movie.”

Fifty years on, though, both movie and album are regarded as high points in Slade’s career: Mark Kermode even described the film as “the Citizen Kane of rock movies”. Both Loncraine and Birkin think that’s rather overstating things, but they are pleased with its reassessment.

Easlea ended up writing Whatever Happened to Slade?, the definitive biography of the band. He now thinks Slade in Flame is a landmark – “I genuinely think this will be the thing that people will look at for posterity’s sake with the group” – and argues that it rings true because the music industry remains just as ruthless: “You could put it in today’s setting and it would be almost exactly as it was then.”

And, Easlea notes, it maybe wasn’t quite the career killer that has been suggested: perhaps more detrimental to their career at home was the fact they spent most of 1974, 75 and 76 touring America and ignoring their domestic audience.

“I’m still proud of it,” says Powell. “I’m still glad we did what we did.”",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/apr/14/citizen-kane-rock-movies-glam-rockers-slade-in-flame,1

The scramble to save British Steel – podcast,"On Saturday, when MPs were supposed to be on their Easter holidays, a rare emergency sitting was called. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, told the House of Commons that they were meeting “in exceptional circumstances to take exceptional action in what are exceptional times”.

MPs passed a bill to save the Scunthorpe steelworks, a vital part of the UK’s critical infrastructure and the last remaining maker of mass-produced virgin steel. The emergency legislation allowed the government to instruct the Chinese owners of the British Steel plant, Jingye, to keep Scunthorpe open or face criminal penalties.

Jasper Jolly is a financial reporter for the Guardian. He tells Helen Pidd that the steelworks are central to life in Scunthorpe and that their loss would be devastating for the town. He explains that the plant has been loss-making for several years and that it is largely the glut of cheap Chinese steel in the global market that has led its owners to consider its closure.

The pair discuss why the government has taken control of Scunthorpe in a way that it did not with the Port Talbot steelworks, the race to keep the blast furnaces hot, and the way that this crisis has led many to question the wisdom of selling critical parts of the UK’s infrastructure to foreign and private companies.

He added that “the banking situation is distinct from 2008 as it has involved far fewer financial players and fewer issues that need to be resolved.”

Still, said Dimon, who leads the country’s largest bank, “financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending.”

>“We are glad to have been in a strong position to help support the US financial system during the recent events that impacted the banking industry,” commented Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf in a statement. “Regional and community banks are an important part of our financial system and are uniquely positioned to serve their customers and communities.”

“Increased financing through the capital markets will require the scale, multi-asset capabilities and excellence in portfolio construction that BlackRock consistently delivers across market cycles,” he said in a statement.

That means bad news for regional banks could be good news for BlackRock – the lack of trust in regional banks will drive more investment into capital markets and BlackRock is poised to benefit as that happens.

Last-minute tax-filing tips,"New York CNN —

So far this tax season, the IRS has received more than 100 million income tax returns for 2022.

That means tens of millions of households have yet to file their returns. If yours is among them, here are some last-minute tax-filing tips to keep in mind as the Tuesday, April 18 deadline approaches.

Not everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there — or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area — it’s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Here is where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area.

Thanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California — which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers — have already been granted an extension until Oct. 16 to file and to pay, according to an IRS spokesperson.

If you’re in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. But your specific extended filing and payment deadlines will depend on the day you leave (or left) the combat zone. This IRS publication offers more detail.

Lastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. But you may want to anyway if you think you are eligible for a refund thanks to, for instance, refundable tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. (Use this IRS tool to gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use IRS Free File (intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won’t cost you to submit a return.

Your paycheck may not be your only source of income: If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. But that’s not necessarily so.

Other potentially taxable and reportable income sources include:

Interest on your savings

Investment income (e.g., dividends and capital gains)

Pay for part-time or seasonal work, or a side hustle

Unemployment income

Social Security benefits or distribution from a retirement account

Tips

Gambling winnings

Income from a rental property you own

Organize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.).

If you don’t recall receiving a hard copy of a tax form in the mail, check your email and your online accounts — a document may have been sent to you electronically.

Here are some of the tax forms you may have received:

W-2 from your wage or salaried jobs

from your wage or salaried jobs 1099-B for capital gains and losses on your investments

for capital gains and losses on your investments 1099-DIV from your brokerage or company where you own stock for dividends or other distributions from their investments

from your brokerage or company where you own stock for dividends or other distributions from their investments 1099-INT for interest over $10 on your savings at a financial institution

for interest over $10 on your savings at a financial institution 1099-NEC from your clients, if you worked as a contractor

from your clients, if you worked as a contractor 1099-K for payments for goods and services through third-party platforms like Venmo, CashApp or Etsy. The 1099-K is required if you made more than $20,000 in over 200 transactions during the year. (Next year the reporting threshold drops to $600.) But even if you didn’t get a 1099-K you still must report all the income that you made over third-party platforms in 2022.

(Next year the reporting threshold drops to $600.) But even if you didn’t get a 1099-K you still must report all the income that you made over third-party platforms in 2022. 1099-Rs for distributions over $10 that you received for a pension, annuity, retirement account, profit-sharing plan or insurance contract

for distributions over $10 that you received for a pension, annuity, retirement account, profit-sharing plan or insurance contract SSA-1099 or SSA-1042S for Social Security benefits received.

“Be aware that there’s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you’re responsible for reporting it on your own,” according to the Illinois CPA Society.

One very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If you’re eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and haven’t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re 50 or older). That will reduce your tax bill and augment your retirement savings.

Proofread your return before submitting it: Do this whether you’re using tax software or working with a professional tax preparer.

Little mistakes and oversights delay the processing of your return (and the issuance of your refund if you’re owed one). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank.

What to do if you can’t file by April 18: If you’re not able to file by next Tuesday, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in by April 18. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file.

Note, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and a penalty on any amount you still owe for 2022 but haven’t paid by April 18.

So if you suspect you still owe tax — perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn’t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year — approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by Tuesday.

You can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18.

Or the more efficient route is pay what you owe electronically at IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY. If you do that, the IRS notes you will not have to file a Form 4868. “The IRS will automatically process an extension of time to file,” the agency notes in its instructions.

If you opt to electronically pay directly from your bank account, which is free, select “extension” and then “tax year 2022” when given the option.

You can also pay by credit or debit card, but you will be charged a processing fee. Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but don’t pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances.

If you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state’s revenue department, Martin said.

Retail spending fell in March as consumers pull back,"Washington, DC CNN —

Spending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back after the banking crisis fueled recession fears.

Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month.

Investors chalk up some of the weakness to a lack of tax returns and concerns about a slowing labor market. The IRS issued $84 billion in tax refunds this March, about $25 billion less than they issued in March of 2022, according to BofA analysts.

That led consumers to pull back in spending at department stores and on durable goods, such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February.

However, retail spending rose 2.9% year-over-year.

The effect of smaller tax returns

Smaller tax returns likely played a role in last month’s decline in retail sales, along with the expiration of enhanced food assistance benefits, economists say.

“March is a really important month for refunds. Some folks might have been expecting something similar to last year,” Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at BofA Global Research, told CNN.

Credit and debit card spending per household tracked by Bank of America researchers moderated in March to its slowest pace in more than two years, which was likely the result of smaller returns and expired benefits, coupled with slowing wage growth.

Enhanced pandemic-era benefits provided through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program expired in February, which might have also held back spending in March, according to a Bank of America Institute report.

A slowing labor market

Average hourly earnings grew 4.2% in March from a year earlier, down from the prior month’s annualized 4.6% increase and the smallest annual rise since June 2021, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Employment Cost Index, a more comprehensive measure of wages, has also shown that worker pay gains have moderated this past year. ECI data for the first quarter of this year will be released later this month.

Still, the US labor market remains solid, even though it has lost momentum recently. That could hold up consumer spending in the coming months, said Michelle Meyer, North America chief economist at Mastercard Economics Institute.

“The big picture is still favorable for the consumer when you think about their income growth, their balance sheet and the health of the labor market,” Meyer said.

Employers added 236,000 jobs in March, a robust gain by historical standards but smaller than the average monthly pace of job growth in the prior six months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The latest monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, showed that the number of available jobs remained elevated in February — but was down more than 17% from its peak of 12 million in March 2022, and revised data showed that weekly claims for US unemployment benefits were higher than previously reported.

The job market could cool further in the coming months. Economists at the Federal Reserve expect the US economy to head into a recession later in the year as the lagged effects of higher interest rates take a deeper hold. Fed economists had forecast subdued growth, with risks of a recession, prior to the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.

For consumers, the effects of last month’s turbulence in the banking industry have been limited so far. Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan worsened slightly in March during the bank failures, but it had already shown signs of deteriorating before then.

The latest consumer sentiment reading, released Friday morning, showed that sentiment held steady in April despite the banking crisis, but that higher gas prices helped push up year-ahead inflation expectations by a full percentage point, rising from 3.6% in March to 4.6% in April.

“On net, consumers did not perceive material changes in the economic environment in April,” Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a news release.

“Consumers are expecting a downturn, they’re not feeling as dismal as they were last summer, but they’re waiting for the other shoe to drop,” Hsu told Bloomberg TV in an interview Friday morning.

Fox News is about to enter the true No Spin Zone,"CNN —

This is it.

The media defamation trial of the century is on the precipice of kicking off in Wilmington, Delaware, in just days.

Jury selection in Dominion Voting Systems’ monster $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit took place all of Thursday, with 300 potential jurors being summoned to court. Good progress was made and the presiding judge noted that there were “more than enough jurors” to start the trial as scheduled on Monday.

It is there, in Courtroom 7E, where the biggest figures in Murdoch Media, accompanied by a throng of high-powered lawyers, will attempt to mount their defense after repeatedly failing to convince a judge to toss the now-historic case.

A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.

It’s, frankly, extraordinary to write those words. When I watched Fox News broadcast election lies in the aftermath of the 2020 election, never did I expect the network to be held accountable in a meaningful way.

I’ve covered Fox News for a while now. I’ve watched thousands and thousands of hours of the right-wing channel’s programming. I’ve seen its hosts over the years undermine public health, make gross anti-immigrant remarks, peddle lies and propaganda and push deranged conspiracy theories that were once reserved for the right-wing’s furthest fringes.

The network has always seemed to find a way to sail through the controversy, even the most hellish storms it has faced. Sometimes it has emerged even stronger and more emboldened than before.

But this time is different. This time, the normal tricks the network turns to during times of crisis will not free it from trouble. This time, in a court of law, the network will need to put forward an honest, fact-driven argument.

Fox News is about to enter the true No Spin Zone, where deception is strictly prohibited. Where it is not in charge. And where its top executives like Rupert Murdoch and Suzanne Scott and hosts like Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity cannot simply ignore a request for comment and resort to, instead, attacking “the media” on-air.

In this setting, where lies cannot be casually told and truth cannot be distorted beyond reality to fit a dishonest narrative, it will be fascinating to see how the network fares. If the pre-trial hearings are any indicator, it won’t be pretty. The case hasn’t even started and the presiding judge has already lost his patience with Fox’s legal team and put them on notice.

Perhaps the winds will shift for Fox News when the judge gavels in the trial on Monday. But if they play out like the last few weeks of court have, Fox News is in for a brutal ride.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/media/fox-news-dominion-hnk-intl/index.html,1
Silicon Valley Bank collapse renews calls to address disparities impacting entrepreneurs of color,"CNN —

When customers at Silicon Valley Bank rushed to withdraw billions of dollars last month, venture capitalist Arlan Hamilton stepped in to help some of the founders of color who panicked about losing access to payroll funds.

As a Black woman with nearly 10 years of business experience, Hamilton knew the options for those startup founders were limited.

SVB had a reputation for servicing people from underrepresented communities like hers. Its failure has reignited concerns from industry experts about lending discrimination in the banking industry and the resulting disparities in capital for people of color.

Hamilton, the 43-year-old founder and managing partner of Backstage Capital, said that when it comes to entrepreneurs of color, “we’re already in the smaller house. We already have the rickety door and the thinner walls. And so, when a tornado comes by, we’re going to get hit harder.”

Established in 1983, the midsize California tech lender was America’s 16th largest bank at the end of 2022 before it collapsed on March 10. SVB provided banking services to nearly half of all venture-backed technology and life-sciences companies in the United States.

Hamilton, industry experts and other investors told CNN the bank was committed to fostering a community of minority entrepreneurs and provided them with both social and financial capital.

SVB regularly sponsored conferences and networking events for minority entrepreneurs, said Hamilton, and it was well known for funding the annual State of Black Venture Report spearheaded by BLK VC, a nonprofit organization that connects and empowers Black investors.

“When other banks were saying no, SVB would say yes,” said Joynicole Martinez, a 25-year entrepreneur and chief advancement and innovation officer for Rising Tide Capital, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 to connect entrepreneurs with investors and mentors.

Martinez is also an official member of the Forbes Coaches Council, an invitation-only organization for business and career coaches. She said SVB was an invaluable resource for entrepreneurs of color and offered their clients discounted tech tools and research funding.

Many women and people of color say they are turned away

Minority business owners have long faced challenges accessing capital due to discriminatory lending practices, experts say. Data from the Small Business Credit Survey, a collaboration of all 12 Federal Reserve banks, shows disparities on denial rates for bank and nonbank loans.

In 2021, about 16% of Black-led companies acquired the total amount of business financing they sought from banks, compared to 35% of White-owned companies, the survey shows.

“We know there’s historic, systemic, and just blatant racism that’s inherent in lending and banking. We have to start there and not tip-toe around it,” Martinez told CNN.

Asya Bradley is an immigrant founder of multiple tech companies like Kinley, a financial services business aiming to help Black Americans build generational wealth. Following SVB’s collapse, Bradley said she joined a WhatsApp group of more than 1,000 immigrant business founders. Members of the group quickly mobilized to support one another, she said.

Immigrant founders often don’t have Social Security numbers nor permanent addresses in the United States, Bradley said, and it was crucial to brainstorm different ways to find funding in a system that doesn’t recognize them.

“The community was really special because a lot of these folks then were sharing different things that they had done to achieve success in terms of getting accounts in different places. They also were able to share different regional banks that have stood up and been like, ‘Hey, if you have accounts at SVB, we can help you guys,’” Bradley said.

Many women, people of color and immigrants opt for community or regional banks like SVB, Bradley says, because they are often rejected from the “top four banks” — JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citibank.

In her case, Bradley said her gender might have been an issue when she could only open a business account at one of the “top four banks” when her brother co-signed for her.

“The top four don’t want our business. The top four are rejecting us consistently. The top four do not give us the service that we deserve. And that’s why we’ve gone to community banks and regional banks such as SVB,” Bradley said.

None of the top four banks provided a comment to CNN. The Financial Services Forum, an organization representing the eight largest financial institutions in the United States has said the banks have committed millions of dollars since 2020 to address economic and racial inequality.

Last week, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN’s Poppy Harlow that his bank has 30% of its branches in lower-income neighborhoods as part of a $30 billion commitment to Black and Brown communities across the country.

Wells Fargo specifically pointed to its 2022 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion report, which discusses the bank’s recent initiatives to reach underserved communities.

The bank partnered last year with the Black Economic Alliance to initiate the Black Entrepreneur Fund — a $50 million seed, startup, and early-stage capital fund for businesses founded or led by Black and African American entrepreneurs. And since May 2021, Wells Fargo has invested in 13 Minority Depository Institutions, fulfilling its $50 million pledge to support Black-owned banks.

Black-owned banks work to close the lending gap and foster economic empowerment in these traditionally excluded communities, but their numbers have been dwindling over the years, and they have far fewer assets at their disposal than the top banks.

OneUnited Bank, the largest Black-owned bank in the United States, manages a little over $650 million in assets. By comparison, JPMorgan Chase manages $3.7 trillion in assets.

SVB’s collapse could spark future change, entrepreneur says

Because of these disparities, entrepreneurs also seek funding from venture capitalists. In the early 2010s, Hamilton intended to start her own tech company — but as she searched for investors, she saw that White men control nearly all venture capital dollars. That experience led her to establish Backstage Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in new companies led by underrepresented founders.

“I said, ‘Well, instead of trying to raise money for one company, let me try to raise for a venture fund that will invest in underrepresented — and now we call them underestimated — founders who are women, people of color, and LGBTQ specifically,’ because I am all three,” Hamilton told CNN.

Since then, Backstage Capital has amassed a portfolio of nearly 150 different companies and has made over 120 diversity investments, according to data from Crunchbase.

But Bradley, who is also an ‘angel investor’ of minority-owned businesses, said she remains “really hopeful” that community banks, regional banks and fintechs “will all stand up and say, ‘Hey, we are not going to let the good work of SVB go to waste.’”",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/13/business/silicon-valley-bank-entrepreneurs-of-color-reaj/index.html,1
"Lake Powell’s total capacity is shrinking, report shows","CNN —

Lake Powell, the second-largest human-made reservoir in the US, has lost nearly 7% of its potential storage capacity since 1963, when Glen Canyon Dam was built, a new report shows.

In addition to water loss due to an intense multiyear drought, the US Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation report found, Lake Powell faced an average annual loss in storage capacity of about 33,270 acre-feet, or 11 billion gallons, per year between 1963 and 2018.

That’s enough water to fill the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall about 1,600 times.

The capacity of the reservoir is shrinking because of sediments flowing in from the Colorado and San Juan rivers, according to the report. Those sediments settle at the bottom of the reservoir and decrease the total amount of water the reservoir can hold.

As of Monday, Lake Powell was around 25% full, according to data from the Bureau of Reclamation.

It’s bad news for a region already facing water shortages and extreme wildfires due to the drought. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration drought experts said last week these conditions are expected to at least continue – if not worsen – in the coming months.

Lake Powell is an important reservoir in the Colorado River Basin. Both Lake Powell and nearby Lake Mead, the nation’s largest reservoir, have drained at an alarming rate. In August, the federal government declared a water shortage on the Colorado River for the first time after Lake Mead’s water level plunged to unprecedented lows, triggering mandatory water consumption cuts for states in the Southwest that began in January.

And last week, Lake Powell dipped below the critical threshold of 3,525 feet above sea level, sparking additional concerns about water supply and hydropower generation millions of people in the West rely on for electricity.

The significance of the dwindling water supply along the Colorado cannot be overstated.

The system supplies water for more than 40 million people living across seven Western states and Mexico. Lakes Powell and Mead provide a critical supply of drinking water and irrigation for many across the region, including rural farms, ranches and native communities.

“It is vitally important we have the best-available scientific information like this report to provide a clear understanding of water availability in Lake Powell as we plan for the future,” Tanya Trujillo, assistant secretary for water and science with the US Department of Interior, said in a statement. “The Colorado River system faces multiple challenges, including the effects of a 22-year-long drought and the increased impacts of climate change.”",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/21/us/lake-powell-capacity-shrinking-drought-climate/index.html,1
IQAir report shows the best and worst places for air quality in 2021,"CNN —

Air pollution spiked to unhealthy levels around the world in 2021, according to a new report.

The report by IQAir, a company that tracks global air quality, found that average annual air pollution in every country — and 97% of cities — exceeded the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines, which were designed to help governments craft regulations to protect public health.

Only 222 cities of the 6,475 analyzed had average air quality that met WHO’s standard. Three territories were found to have met WHO guidelines: the French territory of New Caledonia and the United States territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.

India, Pakistan and Bangladesh were among the countries with the worst air pollution, exceeding the guidelines by at least 10 times.

The Scandinavian countries, Australia, Canada, Japan and United Kingdom ranked among the best countries for air quality, with average levels that exceeded the guidelines by 1 to 2 times.

In the United States, IQAir found air pollution exceeded WHO guidelines by 2 to 3 times in 2021.

“This report underscores the need for governments around the world to help reduce global air pollution,” Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir North America, told CNN. “(Fine particulate matter) kills far too many people every year and governments need to set more stringent air quality national standards and explore better foreign policies that promote better air quality.”

IQAir

Above: IQAir analyzed average annual air quality for more than 6,000 cities and categorized them from best air quality, in blue (Meets WHO PM2.5 guildline) to worst, in purple (Exceeds WHO PM2.5 guideline by over 10 times). An interactive map is available from IQAir.

It’s the first major global air quality report based on WHO’s new annual air pollution guidelines, which were updated in September 2021. The new guidelines halved the acceptable concentration of fine particulate matter — or PM 2.5 — from 10 down to 5 micrograms per cubic meter.

PM 2.5 is the tiniest pollutant yet also among the most dangerous. When inhaled, it travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources like the burning of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to a number of health threats including asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses.

Millions of people die each year from air quality issues. In 2016, around 4.2 million premature deaths were associated with fine particulate matter, according to WHO. If the 2021 guidelines had been applied that year, WHO found there could have been nearly 3.3 million fewer pollution-related deaths.

IQAir analyzed pollution-monitoring stations in 6,475 cities across 117 countries, regions and territories.

In the US, air pollution spiked in 2021 compared to 2020. Out of the more than 2,400 US cities analyzed, Los Angeles air remained the most polluted, despite seeing a 6% decrease compared to 2020. Atlanta and Minneapolis saw significant increases in pollution, the report showed.

“The (United States’) reliance on fossil fuels, increasing severity of wildfires as well as varying enforcement of the Clean Air Act from administration to administration have all added to U.S. air pollution,” the authors wrote.

Researchers say the main sources of pollution in the US were fossil fuel-powered transportation, energy production and wildfires, which wreak havoc on the country’s most vulnerable and marginalized communities.

“We are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, especially in terms of transportation,” said Hammes, who lives a few miles from Los Angeles. “We can act smartly on this with zero emissions, but we’re still not doing it. And this is having a devastating impact on the air pollution that we’re seeing in major cities.”

Climate change-fueled wildfires played a significant role in reducing air quality in the US in 2021. The authors pointed to a number of fires that led to hazardous air pollution — including the Caldor and Dixie fires in California, as well as the Bootleg Fire in Oregon, which wafted smoke all the way to the East Coast in July.

China — which is among the countries with the worst air pollution — showed improved air quality in 2021. More than half of the Chinese cities analyzed in the report saw lower levels of air pollution compared to the previous year. The capital city of Beijing continued a five-year trend of improved air quality, according to the report, due to a policy-driven drawdown of polluting industries in the city.

The report also found that the Amazon Rainforest, which had acted as the world’s major defender against the climate crisis, emitted more carbon dioxide than it absorbed last year. Deforestation and wildfires have threatened the critical ecosystem, polluted the air and contributed to climate change.

“This is all a part of the formula that will lead to or is leading to global warming.” Hammes said.

The report also unveiled some inequalities: Monitoring stations remain scant in some developing countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, resulting in a dearth of air quality data in those regions.

“When you don’t have that data, you’re really in the dark,” Hammes said.

Hammes noted the African country of Chad was included in the report for the first time, due to an improvement in its monitoring network. IQAir found the country’s air pollution was the second-highest in the world last year, behind Bangladesh.

Tarik Benmarhnia, a climate change epidemiologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who has studied the health impact of wildfire smoke, also noted that relying only on monitoring stations can lead to blind spots in these reports.

“I think it is great that they relied on different networks and not only governmental sources,” Benmarhnia, who was not involved in this report, told CNN. “However, many regions do not have enough stations and alternative techniques exist.”

The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in its 2021 report that, in addition to slowing the speed of global warming, curbing the use of fossil fuels would have the added benefit of improving air quality and public health.

Hammes said the IQAir report is even more reason for the world to wean off fossil fuel.

“We’ve got the report, we can read it, we can internalize it and really devote ourselves to taking action,” she said. “There needs to be a major move towards renewable energy. We need to take drastic action in order to reverse the tide of global warming; otherwise, the impact and the train that we’re on (would be) irreversible.”",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/world/air-pollution-2021-iqair-report-climate/index.html,1
Big-box stores could help slash emissions and save millions by installing solar panels on their roofs. So why aren’t more of them doing it?,"CNN —

As the US attempts to wean itself off its heavy reliance on fossil fuels and shift to cleaner energy sources, many experts are eyeing a promising solution: your neighborhood big-box stores and shopping malls.

The rooftops and parking lot space available at retail giants like Walmart, Target and Costco is massive. And these largely empty spaces are being touted as untapped potential for solar power that could help the US reduce its dependency on foreign energy, slash planet-warming emissions and save companies millions of dollars in the process.

At the IKEA store in Baltimore, installing solar panels on the roof and over the store’s parking lot cut the amount of energy it needed to purchase by 84%, slashing its costs by 57% from September to December of 2020, according to the company. (The panels also provide some beneficial shade to keep customers’ cars cool on hot, sunny days.)

As of February 2021, IKEA had 54 solar arrays installed across 90% of its US locations.

Big-box stores and shopping centers have enough roof space to produce half of their annual electricity needs from solar, according to a report from nonprofit Environment America and research firm Frontier Group.

Leveraging the full rooftop solar potential of these superstores would generate enough electricity to power nearly 8 million average homes, the report concluded, and would cut the same amount of planet-warming emissions as pulling 11.3 million gas-powered cars off the road.

The average Walmart store, for example, has 180,000 square feet of rooftop, according to the report. That’s roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes, the report said.

“Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them,” Johanna Neumann, senior director for Environment America’s campaign for 100% Renewable, told CNN. “Now is the time to lean into local renewable energy production, and there’s no better place than the roofs of America’s big-box superstores.”

Advocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities, spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis, which has inflicted disproportionate harm on marginalized communities.

Yet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots, the report’s authors told CNN.

CNN reached out to five of the top US retailers — Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Costco and Target — to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar?

Many renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions, but the companies point to several roadblocks — regulations, labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves — that are preventing more widespread adoption.

The need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming “unquestionably urgent” as the climate crisis accelerates, said Edwin Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University.

“We are behind the eight ball, to put it mildly,” Cowen told CNN. “I would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There’s still a tremendous amount of work to do.”

What’s the holdup?

Neumann said Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5,000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space — an area larger than Manhattan — and more than 8,974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential, according to the report.

It’s enough electricity to power more than 842,000 homes, the report said.

“Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them.” Johanna Neumann, Environment America

Walmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world, but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company has reported having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy.

Neumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times, urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company has said it’s aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035.

“Of all the retailers in America, Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores,” Neumann told CNN. “And for us, this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.”

According to Environment America, Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company’s installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location’s electricity needs.

Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association’s most recent report. It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar — around a quarter of the company’s stores — a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties’ energy needs, the spokesperson said.

Richard Galanti, the chief financial officer at Costco, said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world, 95 of which are in the US.

Walmart, Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.

“My suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual,” Neumann said. “Historically, all those roofs have done is cover their stores, and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators, not just protection from rain, requires a small change in their business model.”

Home Depot, which has around 2,300 stores, currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects, 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development, said Craig D’Arcy, the company’s director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores’ energy needs on average, he said.

Aging rooftops at stores are a “huge impediment” to solar installation, D’Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner, it doesn’t make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today, he said.

“We have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive,” D’Arcy told CNN.

CNN also reached out to Kroger, which owns about 2,800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokesperson, said the company currently has 15 properties — stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants — with solar installations. One of the “multiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation” was the stores’ ability to support a solar installation on the roofs, Howard said.

Cowen, the engineering professor at Cornell, said solar is already attractive, but that labor costs, incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations.

“For them, this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy,” Cowen said. “It’s just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough, but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.”

Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, who co-chairs the power sector task force in the House, said the US has “failed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.” The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because “our system is so disjointed” and has a complex regulation structure, Casten said.

“Why aren’t we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction, and we penalize clean energy production,” Casten told CNN. “For a long, long time, if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart, your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn’t want to lose the load.

“We could have done this decades ago,” Casten added. “And had we done it, we would not be in this dire position with the climate, but we’d also have a lot more money in our pocket.”

Acting on climate, equitably

For Charles Callaway, director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice, strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer, especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later.

Either way, it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels — and it’s doable, Callaway told CNN.

The New York City resident led a worker training program that helped train more than 100 local community members, mostly people of color, to become solar installers. He also formed a solar workers cooperative to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market.

In the last two years, Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units, but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York. He emphasized that hiring locally would be most beneficial since local installers know the community and local regulations best.

“One of my huge concerns is social equity,” Cowen said. “Access to renewable energy is a fairly privileged position these days, and we’ve got to figure out ways to make that not true.”

Jasmine Graham, WE ACT’s energy justice policy manager, said the potential of building rooftop solar on big box superstores is encouraging, only “if these projects use local labor, if they are paying prevailing wages, and if this solar is being used in a manner such as community solar, which would allow [utility] bill discounts for folks that live in the same utility zone.”

Pressure is mounting for global leaders to act urgently on the climate crisis after a UN report in late February warned the window for action is rapidly closing.

Neumann believes the US can meet its energy demand with renewables. All it takes, she said, is the political will to make that switch, and the inclusion of the local community so no one gets left behind in the transition.

“The sooner we make that transition, the sooner we’ll have cleaner air, the sooner we’ll have a more protected environment and better health and the sooner we’ll have a more livable future for our kids,” Neumann said. “And even if that requires investment, it is an investment worth making.”",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/20/us/solar-power-on-big-box-store-rooftops-climate/index.html,1
Blackpink headline Coachella in Korean hanboks,"Editor’s Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, ‘Look of the Week’ is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days.

CNN —

Bringing the second day of this year’s Coachella to a close, K-Pop girl group Blackpink made history Saturday night when they became the first Asian act to ever headline the festival. To a crowd of, reportedly, over 125,000 people, Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa and Rosé used the ground-breaking moment to pay homage to Korean heritage by arriving onstage in hanboks: a traditional type of dress.

While the garments were shrugged off a few seconds into their opening track, “Pink Venom,” revealing each member’s custom black and pink Dolce and Gabbana outfit, fans across the world had already received the message. Screenshots of the moment quickly spread among Blackpink superfans, otherwise known as Blinks. “The way they stepped onto the biggest western stage in hanboks … literally proved their place at the top of the industry,” tweeted one Blink. “Blackpink really are in a league of their own.”

Another called the group “Korea’s cultural delegation” on Instagram, in reference to not only the hanboks but other visual cues incorporated into their show, such as one of the stage backdrops featuring an angular tiled roof reminiscent of traditional Korean architecture.

In recent years, Blackpink have enjoyed a meteoric rise to global fame. According to Guinness World Records, they are currently the most streamed female group on Spotify, and have the most-viewed music YouTube channel. Last year, they were the first female K-Pop group to reach number 1 in the UK and US album charts, and in 2020 their track “How You Like That” became the most viewed video on YouTube in 24 hours. (The group also wore modernized hanboks, designed by Kim Danha, in one of the music video’s scenes.) Their landmark set over the weekend was in fact a follow-up to another milestone: In 2019, they became the first female K-Pop group to ever play at Coachella or any other US festival.

From the iconic Jean Paul Gaultier cone bra worn by Madonna for her 1990 Blond Ambition tour to Geri “Ginger Spice” Halliwell’s Union Jack mini dress, the right stage costume can live on forever in public memory. Particularly when worn at a career-defining moment. During another watershed Coachella performance — Beyonce’s 2018 headline set — the singer’s custom Balmain collegiate-style yellow hoodie was a joyful nod to Black culture, specifically historically Black colleagues and universities.

The group’s four black hanboks were custom created by South Korean pattern design brand OUWR and traditional Korean dressmakers Kumdanje. Inspired by the Cheol-lik silhouette, each garment was hand-embroidered with metallic traditional Korean motifs, including dan-cheong patterns and peonies (a symbol of royalty in Korea). “It was our pleasure and such an honor to be able to show the beautiful values of Korea and Hanbok together,” the designers wrote in a combined Instagram post. “Blackpink showed the beauty of Korea and dazzled the world.”

In Korea, hanboks are still worn for special occasions and often seen on TV dramas. Many designers in the country have also created contemporary takes that are incorporated into everyday wear. At Seoul Fashion Week, JULYCOLUMN’s Fall-Winter 2023 collection drew on the hanbok’s voluminous silhouette to create shirts and structured jackets. Last September, Korean label BlueTamburin brought the garment to a Western audience by exclusively using traditional hanbok fabric to create its Spring-Summer 2023 collection at Milan Fashion Week.

Whether you’re a devoted Blink or not, the looks marked a moment of Asian visibility, recognition of traditional craftsmanship and a powerful example of feeling seen through fashion — representing Korean culture and symbolically embracing both its past and future.

At the end of their performance, and having addressed the audience between numbers in English throughout their two-hour-long performance, Blackpink finished their set in Korean: “Until now, it has been Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa, and Rosé Blackpink. Thank you.”

"An Old Master’s secret ingredient? Egg yolk, new study suggests","Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

“Old Masters” such as Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli and Rembrandt may have used proteins, especially egg yolk, in their oil paintings, according to a new study.

Trace quantities of protein residue have long been detected in classic oil paintings, though they were often ascribed to contamination. A new study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications found the inclusion was likely intentional — and sheds light on the technical knowledge of the Old Masters, the most skilled European painters of the 16th, 17th, or early 18th century, and the way they prepared their paints.

“There are very few written sources about this and no scientific work has been done before to investigate the subject in such depth,” said study author Ophélie Ranquet of the Institute of Mechanical Process Engineering and Mechanics at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany, in a phone interview. “Our results show that even with a very small amount of egg yolk, you can achieve an amazing change of properties in the oil paint, demonstrating how it might have been beneficial for the artists.”

Simply adding some egg yolk to their works, it turns out, could have long-lasting effects that went beyond just aesthetics.

Eggs vs. oil

Compared with the medium formulated by ancient Egyptians called tempera — which combines egg yolk with powdered pigments and water — oil paint creates more intense colors, allows for very smooth color transitions and dries far less quickly, so it can be used for several days after its preparation. However, oil paint, which uses linseed or safflower oil instead of water, also has drawbacks, including being more susceptible to color darkening and damage caused by exposure to light.

Because making paint was an artisanal and experimental process, it is possible that the Old Masters might have added egg yolk, a familiar ingredient, to the newer type of paint, which first showed up in the seventh century in Central Asia before spreading to Northern Europe in the Middle Ages and Italy during the Renaissance. In the study, the researchers recreated the process of paint-making by using four ingredients — egg yolk, distilled water, linseed oil and pigment — to mix two historically popular and significant colors, lead white and ultramarine blue.

“The addition of egg yolk is beneficial because it can tune the properties of these paints in a drastic way,” Ranquet said, “For example by showing aging differently: It takes a longer time for the paint to oxidize, because of the antioxidants contained in the yolk.”

The chemical reactions between the oil, the pigment and the proteins in the yolk directly affect the paint’s behavior and viscosity. “For example, the lead white pigment is quite sensitive to humidity, but if you coat it with a protein layer, it makes it a lot more resistant to it, making the paint quite easy to apply,” Ranquet said.

“On the other hand, if you wanted something stiffer without having to add a lot of pigment, with a bit of egg yolk you can create a high impasto paint,” she added, referring to a painting technique where the paint is laid out in a stroke thick enough that the brushstrokes are still visible. Using less pigment would have been desirable centuries ago, when certain pigments — such as lapis lazuli, which was used to make ultramarine blue — were more expensive than gold, according to Ranquet.

A direct evidence of the effect of egg yolk in oil paint, or lack thereof, can be seen in Leonardo da Vinci’s “Madonna of the Carnation,” one of the paintings observed during the study. Currently on display at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, Germany, the work shows evident wrinkling on the face of Mary and the child.

“Oil paint starts to dry from the surface down, which is why it wrinkles,” Ranquet said.

One reason for wrinkling may be an insufficient quantity of pigments in the paint, and the study has shown that this effect could be avoided with the addition of egg yolk: “That’s quite amazing because you have the same quantity of pigment in your paint, but the presence of the egg yolk changes everything.”

Because wrinkling occurs within days, it’s likely that Leonardo and other Old Masters might have caught onto this particular effect, as well as additional beneficial properties of egg yolk in oil paint, including resistance to humidity. The “Madonna of Carnation” is one of Leonardo’s earliest paintings, created at a time when he might have been still trying to master the then newly popular medium of oil paint.

New understanding of the classics

Another painting observed during the study was “The Lamentation Over the Dead Christ,” by Botticelli, also on display at the Alte Pinakothek. The work is mostly made with tempera, but oil paint has been used for the background and some secondary elements.

“We knew that some parts of the paintings show brushstrokes that are typical for what we call an oil painting, and yet we detected the presence of proteins,” Ranquet said. “Because it’s a very small quantity and they are difficult to detect, this might be dismissed as contamination: In workshops, artists used many different things, and maybe the eggs were just from the tempera.”

However, because adding egg yolk had such desirable effects on oil paint, the presence of proteins in the work might be an indication of deliberate use instead, the study suggested. Ranquet hopes that these preliminary findings might attract more curiosity toward this understudied topic.

Maria Perla Colombini, a professor of analytical chemistry at the University of Pisa in Italy, who was not involved in the study, agreed. “This exciting paper provides a new scenario for the understanding of old painting techniques,” she said in an email.

“The research group, reporting results from molecular level up to a macroscopic scale, contributes to a new knowledge in the use of egg yolk and oil binders. They are not more looking at simply identifying the materials used by Old Masters but explain how they could produce wonderful and glittering effects by employing and mixing the few available natural materials. They try to discover the secrets of old recipes of which little or nothing is written,” she added.

“This new knowledge contributes not only to a better conservation and preservation of artworks but also to a better comprehension of art history.”

How Playboy cut ties with Hugh Hefner to create a post-MeToo brand,"Editor’s Note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation.

The Conversation —

Hugh Hefner launched Playboy Magazine 70 years ago this year. The first issue included a nude photograph of Marilyn Monroe, which he had purchased and published without her knowledge or consent.

Hefner went on to build the Playboy brand off the backs of the countless women featured in its pages, whose beauty and performance of heightened feminine sexuality have entertained its readers for generations.

Approaching its 70th anniversary in December, Playboy has radically shifted. With the magazine no longer in publication, the Playboy Mansion sold to a developer and London’s last remaining Playboy Club closing in 2021, what is the future for Playboy? The brand is changing to keep up with the post-#MeToo world.

Hefner passed away one month before allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein surfaced in 2017 giving momentum to the #MeToo movement (which saw survivors of sexual assault and harassment speak out against their abusers).

In recent years, many have re-evaluated Hefner’s legacy and relationships with women. The 2022 docuseries “The Secrets of Playboy” (which aired on Channel 4 in the UK) detailed sexual misconduct accusations against Hefner from several ex-girlfriends, including model Sondra Theodore and TV personality Holly Madison.

Hefner and Playboy’s relationship with women has been complicated. Playboy was an early supporter of abortion rights, helped fund the first rape kit and was at times an early proponent of inclusivity (for example featuring transgender model, Caroline “Tula” Cossey, in its June 1981 issue). But most women featured in Playboy have fit within a narrow beauty standard — thin, white, able-bodied and blonde.

Meanwhile Hefner’s personal relationship with his much younger girlfriends reportedly followed patterns of control and emotional abuse. Ex-girlfriend Holly Madison described Hefner as treating her “like a glorified pet” in her 2015 memoir, “Down the Rabbit Hole.”

Hefner’s passing meant he evaded reckoning with the #MeToo movement. Playboy, however, responded, releasing a statement in which it affirmed support for the women featured in “The Secrets of Playboy” and called Hefner’s actions “abhorrent.”

The statement declared that the brand was no longer affiliated with the Hefner family and would be focusing on aspects of the company’s legacy that align with values of sex positivity and free expression.

Today, Playboy is a very different company from the one Hefner launched nearly 70 years ago. Roughly 80% of Playboy staff identify as women, according the company, and its motto has changed from “Entertainment for Men” to “Pleasure for All.” Shares in the company are publicly traded and 40% of its board and management are women.

The company has also moved towards more creator-led content through its app, Playboy Centerfold. Similar to subscription content service OnlyFans, Playboy Centerfold allows subscribers to view content from and interact with its creators, which it call “bunnies.”

On the app, creators — or bunnies — are able portray their own bodies however they wish, putting the power back in their hands. Perhaps Playboy’s future is no longer in serving the male gaze, but instead the very audience Hefner dismissed in his first letter from the editor:

“If you’re a man between the ages of 18 and 80 Playboy is meant for you … If you’re somebody’s sister, wife or mother-in-law and picked us up by mistake, please pass us along to the man in your life and get back to your Ladies Home Companion.”

The bunnies next door

The stars of Playboy’s mid-2000s reality series, Holly Madison and Bridget Marquardt, are also enjoying a resurgence among fans.

“The Girls Next Door” launched in 2004. The show focused on the lives of Hefner’s three girlfriends, Madison, Marquardt and Kendra Wilkinson. It became E’s best performing show and cultivated a new female audience for Playboy.

“The Girls Next Door” was a story of complicated empowerment despite patriarchal interference. Its three female protagonists went from being known solely as some of Hefner’s many blonde girlfriends, to celebrities in their own right.

They each ultimately broke up with Hefner, leaving the Mansion and going on to lead successful careers.

The show’s depiction of Madison, Marquardt and Wilkinson as empowered, fun-loving and complex individuals, who found joy and agency through expressing their sexuality was perhaps what drew so many female fans to the show. However, amid the girls’ fight for agency, Hefner retaliated.

The series shows that he maintained final say in every Playboy photograph of the girls, as well as imposing strict curfews and spending allowances.

In Madison and Wilkinson’s memoirs, “Down the Rabbit Hole,” and “Sliding into Home,” they claim that production consistently undermined them. They refused to pay them for the first season, didn’t credit them until season four and aired their uncensored nude bodies in foreign broadcasts and DVD releases without consent.

Fan interest in “The Girls Next Door” remains strong. In August 2022 Madison and Marquardt launched their podcast “Girls Next Level,” where they interview previous playmates and interact with fans. They also recap episodes from their own points of view, unpacking their experiences of working on the show.

Having reached 10 million downloads as of February 2023, the success of the podcast — 14 years after the last episode of “The Girls Next Door” — speaks to the cultural legacy of the Playboy brand. It also shows that despite Hefner’s original editor’s note, Playboy resonates with some women.

Playboy is now in a post-Hefner era, where the imagery of women found within old issues of Playboy can serve as inspiration for others to enjoy their own sexuality. Whatever the future has for the company, the concept of Playboy has become public property — be that in the appearance of Playboy bunny costumes each Halloween, the popularity of cheeky Playboy logo tattoos or branded lingerie and clothing.

In a post-#MeToo era, the women of Playboy are speaking up and taking over. With the mansion gates closed, the bunnies are finally reclaiming the brand as their own.

‘A definitive backslide.’ Inside fashion’s worrying runway trend,"CNN —

Now that the Fall-Winter 2023 catwalks have been disassembled, it’s clear one trend was more pervasive than any collective penchant for ruffles, pleated skirts or tailored coats.

Across runways in New York, London, Milan and Paris, there was a notable scarcity of plus-size models. This comes at a time when there are five injectable medications which can be used as appetite suppressants currently available by prescription in the US, stirring much conversation; a sixth medication, Rybelsus, is taken as an oral pill. Two are officially approved in the UK — the largest influx of weight loss medication seen in the country in almost a decade.

In recent months, injectables such as Wegovy and Ozempic — which share the same active ingredient, semaglutide — have been widely reported as Hollywood’s worst-kept weight loss secret. (Ozempic is intended for use primarily to treat Type 2 diabetes.) Comedian Chelsea Handler claimed her “anti-aging doctor just hands (Ozempic) out to anybody” while appearing on a podcast in January. Even Elon Musk tweeted last year about being on Wegovy.

For many fashion commentators and diversity advocates, the Fall-Winter 2023 runways were in sharp contrast to the (albeit limited) progress and heady promise of recent seasons. This rollback has been widely criticized in the style media as such. And its potential impact is being assessed more broadly: With the rise of these weight loss panaceas, the pursuit of size zero is now just a prescription away.

The Fall-Winter failings

In 2020, Jill Kortleve and Paloma Elsesser became the first models outside of a sample size to walk for the Italian fashion house Fendi. (Traditionally, a sample size falls between a US 0-4.) British label Erdem entered the plus-size market in 2021, extending its offering to a UK size 22 (or US size 18). And in January 2022, Valentino made headlines after its haute couture show featured a broad spectrum of body types. But this season, there was a visible lack of curve bodies on their runways — or many others.

Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment.

According to fashion search engine Tagwalk, the number of mid and plus-size models dropped by 24% in comparison to Spring-Summer 2023. Similarly, a size inclusivity report conducted by Vogue Business found that 95.6% of all looks presented for Fall-Winter 2023 were in a size US 0-4. For context, industry market firm Plunkett Research estimated in 2015 that 68% of American women wear a size US 14 or above.

“It was a definitive backslide,” said IMG model agent Mina White, who represents plus-size and curve supermodels including Elsesser and Ashley Graham. “It was frustrating to see some of these designers not using curved bodies where they had in the past.” Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment.

“Watching somebody like Ashley Graham attend the front row for so many of these major houses in full looks (provided by the designer), it was frustrating,” White continued. “They wanted to utilize her image and her social following to command a certain space in the market, but they didn’t want to be reflective on their runways.”

For others, even the term “backslide” was too generous. “Slipping back from… what? A glorious time when the average American woman (size 16) was as present on the runways as she is in everyday life? A time when fashion ads cast as many ‘plus-size’ and ‘mid-size’ women as ‘straight-size’ women?” fashion journalist Amy Odell wrote in her Substack newsletter of this past season’s runways. “No one needed any data to understand that representing a wide array of body shapes and sizes in runway shows or in fashion imagery is not a priority for the industry.”

That said, a handful of — mostly smaller — brands pushed ahead this season. In London, emerging labels Di Petsa, Karoline Vitto and Sinead O’Dwyer showcased lineups of size-diverse models. Inclusivity at Christian Siriano, Coach, Kim Shui, Collina Strada and Bach Mai stood out in New York; while in Paris, Belgian brand Esther Manas — a consistent flag-bearer for size diversity — staged one of the city’s most refreshing runways with an assortment of fun, sensual, feminine looks that complimented a range of bodies.

There was also a smattering of mid- and plus-size castings to be seen elsewhere: Off-White and Michael Kors, for example, featured a few such models. At Harris Reed’s debut for Nina Ricci, Precious Lee opened the show — which also featured three more plus- and mid-size models.

It starts with sample size

Fashion samples and sample size pieces are one-off garments made before an item is mass-produced, typically to be worn during runway shows. Prioritizing the same body type in sample sizes means runway models are more easily interchangeable, saving fashion houses time and money if someone were to drop out or get sick during or after the casting process for a show.

It’s also partly why, according to White, casting curve models is still an uphill battle. She says she introduces brands to new faces months in advance of runway season, with their specific measurements up-top and easy to read in all correspondence. “I want to be ahead of that,” White said. “So I’m never told ‘Oh, we wanted to make it work, but we didn’t have her size’ or whatever that conversation might look like.”

But despite her efforts, she says she’s frequently told it’s too much of a “financial lift” to make larger samples — even by legacy brands. “I get very upset when brands say that,” White said. “I don’t believe that it is, I believe that it’s people not being properly educated on how to do this right.”

Beyond the lack of representation, White notes it’s painful for plus-size consumers to watch brands leverage resources to create custom, made-to-fit pieces for celebrities — all the while claiming the pot is empty for more inclusive runway samples.

London-based stylist and editor Francesca Burns agrees sample sizes are part of the problem. In 2020, Burns went viral after she posted on Instagram about a fashion job gone wrong. She says she was sent five looks to style from Celine, none of which fit the size UK 8 (US 4) model booked for the shoot— an 18-year-old on her first job in the business. The experience left her “horrified,” Burns told CNN, recalling what she saw as the model’s shame and embarrassment. “Looking into this girl’s eyes,” Burns said, “she shouldn’t have felt like that.”

Burns’ post, which called the current system “unacceptable,” was picked up widely in the fashion media. (When reached by CNN, Celine declined to comment on the incident.) “Ultimately, the desire to see change has to be there,” Burns said. “And I wonder whether luxury has that desire?”

A case for change

Progress has been slow, but not entirely inexistent. Across fashion campaigns, magazine covers and editorial shoots, there is a growing enthusiasm for inclusivity. “I see the options rolling in for the plus-sized talent, and they’re great offerings,” said White. “Great, strong editorials and covers and campaigns. But I do feel like without the clothes, we are going to go back to see more naked curve stories, or lingerie curve stories or a curve girl in a trench coat. That’s what I don’t want.”

For British Vogue’s April issue, unveiled March 16, Elsesser, Lee and Jill Kortleve were dubbed “The New Supers.” Preceding the cover story is a letter written by editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful commending the models for “leading the way” and holding “powerful space” in the industry.

“Catwalks are once again under scrutiny for a stark lack of body diversity,” read the magazine’s Instagram caption, unveiling the cover. “But this cover was not conceived as a statement. It is a crowning of an all-powerful trio, the supermodels for a new generation.”

But many online were quick to point out the disconnect: Two of the Saint Laurent Spring-Summer 2023 dresses were modeled by plus-size women, though they are not available to buy in most plus sizes.

In his own social media post, Enninful wrote about his disappointment at the Fall-Winter 2023 runways. “I thought I had gotten into a time machine. Show after show dominated by one body type, so many limited visions of womanhood… one prescribed notion of beauty prevailed again, and it felt like the reality of so many women around the world were being ignored.”

But for White, the power rests within the entire industry — not just at the feet of brands. “I really do believe there should be an industry standard between the (Council of Fashion Designers of America), the British Fashion Council and key editors at some of these major mass market magazines,” she continued. “If there was a call-to-action from these figureheads saying, moving forward samples need to be readily available for a few different body types, we would see significant and impactful change.”

Burns agrees there must be a trickle-down effect. “I think a lot of responsibility is put on young designers to solve all these issues around sustainability or issues around body inclusivity,” she said. “It’s important that the big powerhouses, which have the capacity to action change, really take some responsibility.”

‘No such thing as a free lunch’

On March 8, Wegovy — developed primarily as a treatment for those living with obesity and weight-related conditions — was approved in the UK. It’s the second injectable weight management medication to be made available with a prescription via the country’s National Health Service (NHS) in about 3 years, after almost a decade of quiet. Before 2020, the last weight loss medication was approved in the UK was in 2010.

Similarly, the US has now approved three weight management injections: Wegovy, Saxenda and IMCIVREE. Medications for type-2 diabetes like Mounjaro and Ozempic are not FDA-approved for weight loss, though some doctors are issuing them at their own discretion.

While these medicines are a revolutionary tool for those who struggle to lose weight for genetic or medical reasons, they are at risk of being abused.

Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic, was originally developed for treating type-2 diabetes. It quells hunger signals to the brain by mimicking the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). “It can slow how quickly your stomach empties out and may give you a little more feeling of feeling full,” said Dr. Robert Lash, an endocrinologist and Chief Medical Officer of the Endocrine Society in Washington, D.C. In clinical trials, over a period of 68 weeks, participants who used the medication in conjunction with eating fewer calories and increasing their physical activity on average lost around 15% of their body weight compared to 2.4% of those using a placebo, according to the manufacturer Novo Nordisk.

On March 13, the European Medicines Agency issued a statement warning of an Ozempic shortage that could continue through the year, urging doctors to prioritize prescriptions to diabetics. “Any other use, including for weight management, represents off-label use and currently places the availability of Ozempic for the indicated population at risk,” read the release.

Patients typically need a BMI of 27 or higher (along with another weight-related condition like high blood pressure or diabetes) or have a genetic predisposition towards obesity to be prescribed such appetite suppressant medication by their doctor. But talk of these injectables has been sweeping the West. In January, the New York Times reported on the term “Ozempic Face,” coined by a New York-based dermatologist who reported treating several patients with a hollowed-out appearance that can come with rapid weight loss. By the end of February, the medication had made it to the cover of New York Magazine in a feature titled “Life After Food?” Adverts for GLP-1 injections are even blanketing New York City subway stations.

And across social media, online forums and private group chats, some people looking to lose weight for primarily aesthetic purposes are searching for a way to skirt the requirements.

“I was just looking for a way to lose a few pounds, like 10 to 15 at most,” said one 30-year-old American woman, who wished to remain anonymous, in a phone interview. She scoured social media and forums for guidance on securing a weight loss drug. “I’m certainly a normal BMI, I just have a trip to Mexico coming up and I want to look really good,” she said.

Although she says she found a way to access Wegovy, she decided against the medication after considering the cost (which can reach more than $1,000 a month without insurance). “I’ve always very much fit the societal standard but lately I was just like f*ck it, I want to be skinny,” she told CNN.

Dr. Lash emphasized the importance of taking weight loss drugs only with medical supervision and a valid prescription. “If somebody was a normal weight and they took this drug because they thought they could be even thinner than they are now, that could lead to complications,” he told CNN, warning of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and even gallbladder problems. “These drugs are not benign, they do have side effects involving the GI tract. There’s no such thing as a free lunch.”

Every body is invited

Fashion has long promoted size 0 as the ultimate virtue — regardless of its viability for many people, or any health risks. And now with the accessibility of accelerated weight loss medication, the stakes are even higher. For Burns and White, the industry is responsible for amplifying a new, more inclusive vision of beauty.

“There’s a very archaic way of looking at women over a size 16 and just assuming that they’re unhealthy or uneducated or unstylish. Or don’t have the resources to buy into luxury,” said White. “The reality is the same women these brands are alienating in their fashion space are the same women running out to buy their handbags, shoes, perfumes, cosmetics and skincare.”

Not only do designers need to create clothes with this consumer in mind, according to White, but they need to be seen on the runway, too.

“It shouldn’t be a conversation. It should just be normalized that we’re not just looking at a single view of beauty,” echoed Burns.

Ester Manas and Balthazar Delepierre, whose bridal-inspired Fall-Winter 2023 collection was one of this season’s most size-diverse runways, summarized it best in their accompanying show notes: “The body is not the subject. Because, obviously, at a wedding, everybody is invited. And all to the party. That is where the designer duo Ester and Balthazar take their stand.”",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/fashion-week-fall-winter-2023-size-diversity-skinny-wegovy/index.html,1
Michael Jordan’s 1998 NBA Finals sneakers sell for a record $2.2 million,"Editor’s Note: This story was updated with the final sale price and other details following the auction.

CNN —

In 1998, Michael Jordan laced up a pair of his iconic black and red Air Jordan 13s to bring home a Bulls victory during Game 2 of his final NBA championship — and now they are the most expensive sneakers ever to sell at auction.



The game-winning sneakers sold for $2.2 million at Sotheby’s in New York on Tuesday, smashing the sneaker auction record of $1.47 million, set in 2021 by a pair of Nike Air Ships that Jordan wore earlier in his career.

The sale arrives during “Jordan Year” — a reference to the NBA star player’s iconic jersey number 23. In January, Air Jordan partnered with Sotheby’s to auction off 13 pairs of retro sneakers that were designed in memory of The Notorious B.I.G. All lots outsold their high estimates of $5,000 by multiples, with the highest selling for more than $32,000.

Last year, Jordan’s Game 1 jersey, also from the 1998 finals, became the most expensive item of worn sports memorabilia to sell at auction when it fetched $10.1 million at a Sotheby’s sale.

Jordan’s farewell run with the Chicago Bulls is often referred to as “The Last Dance,” after the title of an ESPN and Netflix documentary that chronicled the season. Jordan announced his (second) retirement weeks before the finals, leading to the six-game series against the Utah Jazz becoming the most-watched in NBA history, based on Nielsen TV ratings. (Jordan would later return from 2001 to 2003 to play with the Washington Wizards, but did not win another championship).

“Michael Jordan game-worn sports memorabilia has proven time and time again to be the most elite and coveted items on the market,” said Brahm Wachter, Sotheby’s head of streetwear and modern collectables, in a press release prior to the sale. “However, items from his ‘Last Dance’ season are of a greater scale and magnitude as seen with our record-breaking sale of his Game 1 jersey in 2022.”

The pair of sneakers sold Tuesday were worn during Game 2, in Salt Lake City, which the Bulls won 93-88 after losing Game 1, with Jordan scoring 37 points. They are the last pair of black and red Air Jordan 13s that Jordan ever wore on the court for an NBA game, a press release from Sotheby’s noted.

Following Game 2, Jordan signed and gifted the set of worn shoes to the ball boy in the visitor’s locker room, as he was known to do, according to Sotheby’s.

The Air Jordan 13 sneakers starred in a sports memorabilia sale called “Victoriam,” which featured items worn by athletes including Tom Brady, Kobe Bryant and Roger Federer. Several other Jordan items were included in the two-part auction, with a game-worn 1998 Bulls jersey and a pair of 1985 Air Jordan 1s fetching $508,000 and $127,000 respectively.

Other top lots included one of Kobe Bryant’s LA Lakers shooting shirts, which sold for over $406,000, and a soccer jersey, worn by the late Pelé on his debut for the New York Cosmos in 1975, that sold fetched over $177,000.

A French photographer offers an unexpected view of the United States through its many strip clubs,"CNN —

Some people travel the world in search of adventure, while others seek out natural wonders, cultural landmarks or culinary experiences. But French photographer François Prost was looking for something altogether different during his recent road trip across America: strip clubs.

From Miami to Los Angeles, Prost’s latest book “Gentlemen’s Club” charts his route across the US via nearly 150 strip clubs with names like Pleasures, Temptations and Cookies N’ Cream. There isn’t a single nude woman to be seen, however, as Prost’s camera was exclusively trained on the buildings themselves — and specifically their often-colorful facades.

Over the course of five weeks in 2019 he traversed over 6,000 miles, with the resulting photos capturing everything from the pastel hues of Florida’s Club Pink Pussycat to venues hiding in plain sight in the country’s more religious states.

“I’d divide these venues into two types: One is very integrated into the public landscape, and one is a bit more hidden and dodgy,” Prost said, speaking to CNN on a video call and email.

The first type, he added, could be found in “very American” settings, such as “around amusement parks and fast food and malls.” The latter venues, however, would sometimes look indistinguishable from any store in a strip mall. Prost said he found many such establishments along the Bible Belt, a socially conservative region in the country’s south. He was especially keen to explore the area due to the apparent contrast between the prevalence of strip clubs and what he describes in his book as “conservatism and extreme puritanism.”

Prost insisted that he had little interest in the interiors or services of the strip clubs, which he always visited during the day. Instead, he hoped to learn more about American culture by creating objective, documentary-style photographs of establishments sitting at the intersection of sex, gender and commerce. Documenting changing attitudes toward sex through the lens of architecture, he added that the series was primarily of a landscape photography project.

“The prism of this theme of strip club facades became a way of studying and trying to understand the country,” he wrote in “Gentlemen’s Club,” photographs from which will feature in an exhibition in Tokyo in March.

”(‘Gentlemen’s Club’ is) an objective panorama of dominant opinions and gender and the sexualization of the feminine image.”

‘A bit strange’

The genesis of Prost’s project dates back to his 2018 series, “After Party,” which focused on the flamboyant facades of French nightclubs. He said that people frequently commented that the buildings’ exteriors looked as though they had been ripped straight out of American cities, sparking the idea that he should visit the US and extend the project.

As he meticulously planned his trip, he was struck not only by the sheer volume of strip clubs in America but that — unlike In Europe — they often demanded to be seen. Hot pink walls, gigantic nude silhouettes and even candy-cane-striped storefronts made no secret of the kind of entertainment provided inside.

“A good example would be Las Vegas, where strip clubs are everywhere and their signs blink as much as a fast food (restaurant) or casino sign,” Prost said.

Miami’s clubs were often painted in vivid, Wes Anderson-esque hues. Other photos show brightly covered venues contrasting with their sparse desert surroundings.

If the establishments were open during the day, Prost would enter and ask for permission to take photos in order “to not look suspicious… and explain what my intentions were,” he said. The interiors rarely lived up to the tantalizing promises plastered across the signs outside, but the photographer met a host of characters during his five-week trip, from indifferent bouncers to managers who were thrilled about the project.

“Most of the time, people were OK — 99% of them would say yes to a facade picture,” he said, adding they typically wouldn’t mind his presence, as long as he didn’t take photos of patrons or dancers.

“Some would think that it was a bit strange, some would be really excited about it and give me their business card to send me the picture when it was done,” he said.

Prost said his biggest surprise, however, was how “normalized” strip clubs appeared to be in everyday life. As he reflects in his book, “The relationship that Americans seem to have with strip clubs is quite different to what you see in Europe. Going to a strip club seems to be a lot more normalized … You go as a couple, or amongst friends at night to have fun.”

He was struck, for instance, by the fact that so many Las Vegas strip clubs doubled as restaurants — with many boasting happy hour deals, buffets and special discounts for truck drivers or construction workers.

“I noticed a few strip clubs that would advertise being a strip club and steakhouse, so you could eat a big piece of meat (while) watching strippers. That is also something that seems very American to me,” he said, adding: “I heard from some people I met in Portland there are even strip clubs (that offer) vegan food.”

Objects of desire

The facades are littered with jokes like “My sex life is like the Sahara, 2 palms, no dates” and pun-based names like Booby Trap and Bottoms Up. Prost’s documentarian approach heightens the signs’ surreal comedy. But it also doubles as a neutral lens through which viewers can make up their own minds about the objectification of women.

By honing in on the faceless dancing bodies of female silhouettes and the quintessential “girls girls girls” signs, “Gentleman’s Club” explores the commodification of women who are, in reality, completely absent in Prost’s works (an observation reflected in the book’s title, which is a phrase that crops up numerous times on signs throughout his photographs). The strip clubs he visited market women as things to be consumed, from the many food-themed names to an advertisement reading, “1,000’s of beautiful girls & three ugly ones.”

For his next project, Prost plans to visit Japan to document the nation’s love hotels, which occupy a similar role as strip clubs in some parts of the US: open secrets in a conservative society. But the photographer believes the American establishments he visited say something unique about the country — something that is less about sexuality and more about the American dream.

What his project has shown him is, he said, this: “As long as you’re successful in terms of business, (it doesn’t matter) if your activity deals with sex.”

“Gentlemen’s Club” will be exhibited at Agnes b. Galerie Boutique in Tokyo, Japan, between March 17 and April 15, 2023. The book, published by Fisheye Editions, is available now.",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/francois-prost-gentlemens-club/index.html,1
Here’s the real reason to turn on airplane mode when you fly,"Editor’s Note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation.

CNN —

We all know the routine by heart: “Please ensure your seats are in the upright position, tray tables stowed, window shades are up, laptops are stored in the overhead bins and electronic devices are set to flight mode.”

Now, the first four are reasonable, right? Window shades need to be up so we can see if there’s an emergency, such as fire. Tray tables need to be stowed and seats upright so we can get out of the row quickly. Laptops can become projectiles in an emergency, as the seat back pockets are not strong enough to contain them.

And mobile phones need to be set to flight mode so they can’t cause an emergency for the airplane, right? Well, it depends whom you ask.

Technology has advanced a great deal

Aviation navigation and communication relies on radio services, which has been coordinated to minimize interference since the 1920s.

The digital technology currently in use is much more advanced than some of the older analog technologies we used even 60 years ago. Research has shown personal electronic devices can emit a signal within the same frequency band as the aircraft’s communications and navigation systems, creating what is known as electromagnetic interference.

But in 1992, the US Federal Aviation Authority and Boeing, in an independent study, investigated the use of electronic devices on aircraft interference and found no issues with computers or other personal electronic devices during non-critical phases of flight. (Takeoffs and landings are considered the critical phases.)

The US Federal Communications Commission also began to create reserved frequency bandwidths for different uses – such as mobile phones and aircraft navigation and communications – so they do not interfere with one another. Governments around the globe developed the same strategies and policies to prevent interference problems with aviation. In the EU, electronic devices have been allowed to stay on since 2014.

2.2 billion passengers

Why then, with these global standards in place, has the aviation industry continued to ban the use of mobile phones? One of the problems lies with something you may not expect – ground interference.

Wireless networks are connected by a series of towers; the networks could become overloaded if passengers flying over these ground networks are all using their phones. The number of passengers that flew in 2021 was over 2.2 billion, and that’s half of what the 2019 passenger numbers were. The wireless companies might have a point here.

Of course, when it comes to mobile networks, the biggest change in recent years is the move to a new standard. Current 5G wireless networks – desirable for their higher speed data transfer – have caused concern for many within the aviation industry.

Radio frequency bandwidth is limited, yet we are still trying to add more new devices to it. The aviation industry points out that the 5G wireless network bandwidth spectrum is remarkably close to the reserved aviation bandwidth spectrum, which may cause interference with navigation systems near airports that assist with landing the aircraft.

Airport operators in Australia and the US have voiced aviation safety concerns linked to 5G rollout, however it appears to have rolled out without such problems in the European Union. Either way, it is prudent to limit mobile phone use on planes while issues around 5G are sorted out.

Ultimately, we can’t forget air rage

Most airlines now provide customers with Wi-Fi services that are either pay-as-you-go or free. With new Wi-Fi technologies, passengers could theoretically use their mobile phones to make video calls with friends or clients in-flight.

On a recent flight, I spoke with a cabin attendant and asked her opinion on phone use during flights. It would be an inconvenience for cabin crew to wait for passengers to finish their call to ask them if they would like any drinks or something to eat, she stated. On an airliner with 200+ passengers, in-flight service would take longer to complete if everyone was making phone calls.

For me, the problem with in-flight use of phones is more about the social experience of having 200+ people on a plane, and all potentially talking at once. In a time when disruptive passenger behaviour, including “air rage”, is increasingly frequent, phone use in flight might be another trigger that changes the whole flight experience.

Disruptive behaviours take on various forms, from noncompliance to safety requirements such as not wearing seat belts, verbal altercations with fellow passengers and cabin crew, to physical altercations with passengers and cabin crews – typically identified as air rage.

In conclusion – in-flight use of phones does not currently impair the aircraft’s ability to operate. But cabin crews may prefer not to be delayed in providing in-flight service to all of the passengers – it’s a lot of people to serve.

However, 5G technology is encroaching on the radio bandwidth of aircraft navigation systems; we’ll need more research to answer the 5G question regarding interference with aircraft navigation during landings. Remember that when we are discussing the two most critical phases of flight, takeoffs are optional – but landings are mandatory.",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/airplane-mode-reasons-why/index.html,1
Hippo attacks: How to avoid one of Africa’s most dangerous animals,"CNN —

Paul Templer was living his best life.

He was 28 and conducting tours in his native Zimbabwe, with a focus on photographic safaris.

He had been away for a few years, including a stint in the British army. But he had returned to Africa’s bush country “and fell back in love with it. The wildlife, the flora, the fauna, the great outdoors, the space – just everything about it. I was at home.”

Templer said Zimbabwe’s guide certification program was rigorous, and there was a lot of pride among the guides who passed. He reveled in showing tourists the area’s majestic wildlife – including the water-loving, very territorial hippos.

“It was idyllic,” he told CNN Travel. “Life was really, really good – until one day I had a really bad day at the office.”

A good day for a river trek

The entire course of Paul Templer's life changed after he agreed at the last minute to take a group of tourists down the Zambezi River. Paul Templer

March 9, 1996. A Saturday. Templer learned a good friend who was to lead a canoe safari down the Zambezi River had malaria. He agreed to take his pal’s place. “I loved that stretch of the river. It was an area I know like the back of my hand.”

The expedition consisted of six safari clients (four Air France crewmembers and a couple from Germany), three apprentice guides plus Templer. They had three canoes – clients in the first two seats and a guide in the back. Then one apprentice guide was in a one-person safety kayak.

And down the famed Zambezi they went. “Things were going the way they were supposed to go. Everyone was having a pretty good time.”

Possible trouble ahead

Eventually, they came across a pod of about a dozen hippos. That’s not unexpected on the Zambezi, Africa’s fourth-longest river. They weren’t alarmed at first as they were at a safe distance. But “we were getting closer, and I was trying to take evasive action. … The idea was let’s just paddle safely around the hippos.”

Templer’s canoe led the way, with the other two canoes and kayak to follow. He pulled into a little channel waiting on the others. But the third canoe had fallen back from the group and was off the planned course. Templer’s not sure how that happened.

Suddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. Paul Templer

“Suddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. And Evans, the guide in the back of the canoe, catapulted out of the canoe.” The clients managed to remain in the canoe somehow.

“Evans is in the water, and the current is washing Evans toward a mama hippo and her calf 150 meters [490 feet] away. … So I know I’ve got to get him out quickly. I don’t have time to drop my clients off.” He yells to Ben, one of the other guides, to retrieve the clients who were in the canoe that had been attacked.

Ben got the clients to safety on a rock in the middle of the river that hippos couldn’t climb.

Attempting a rescue

Meanwhile, Templer turned his canoe around to get Evans. The plan was to pull alongside of him and pull him into Templer’s canoe.

“I was paddling towards him … getting closer, and I saw this bow wave coming towards me. If you’ve ever seen any of those old movies with a torpedo coming toward a ship, it was kind of like that. I knew it was either a hippo or a really large crocodile coming at me,” he said.

“But I also knew that if I slapped the blade of my paddle on water … that’s really loud. And the percussion underwater seems to turn the animals away,” he said. “So I slapped the water, and as it was supposed to do, the torpedo wave stops.”

He was getting closer to Evans, but they were also getting closer to the female and calf.

“I’m leaning over – it’s kind of a made-for-Hollywood movie – Evans is reaching up. … Our fingers almost touched. And then the water between us just erupted. Happened so fast I didn’t see a thing.”

What happened next was nightmarish and surreal.

“My world went dark and strangely quiet.” Templer said it took a few seconds to figure out what was going on.

“From the waist down, I could feel the water. I could feel I was wet in the river. From my waist up, it was different. I was warm, and it wasn’t wet like the river, but it wasn’t dry either. And it was just incredible pressure on my lower back. I tried to move around; I couldn’t.

“I realized I was up to my waist down a hippo’s throat.”

Hippos: Huge, territorial and dangerous

There’s a good reason a fully grown hippopotamus can fit a large portion of a fully grown adult in its mouth. Hippos can grow up to 16.5 feet long (5 meters), 5.2 feet tall (1.6 meters) and weigh up to 4.5 tons (4 metric tonnes), according to National Geographic.

They sport enormous mouths and can open their strong jaws to 150 degrees.

Their teeth might be the most frightening thing of all. Their molars are used for eating plants, but their sharp canines, which might reach 20 inches (51 centimeters), are for defense and fighting. Their bite is almost three times stronger than that of a lion. One bite from a hippo can possibly cut a human body in half.

They’re found naturally in various parts sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in East and Southern Africa, living in or near rivers and other water sources. (And they are an invasive species in Colombia thanks to escapees from drug lord Pablo Escobar’s menagerie).

Hippos are very territorial and might aggressively attack any animal encroaching on their territory, including hyenas, lions and crocodiles.

Hippos and humans

They also kill people. That we know for sure. Many internet sources say around 500 a year, but an exact figure is still uncertain because some attacks and deaths come in very remote regions and don’t get reported.

“The question I get asked the most when people find out I study hippos is: ‘Is it true hippos kill more people than any animal?’ Rebecca Lewison, conservation ecologist and associate professor at San Diego State University, told CNN Travel in an email interview.

“I’m not entirely sure where that started but … there is no authority or reliable data. People are surprised that hippos kill people. They look slow, and they are mostly in water. There are some nonfatal interactions, but people (or hippos) tend to fare badly from interactions.”

Dr. Philip Muruthi, chief scientist and vice president of species conservation and science of the African Wildlife Foundation, said the AWF doesn’t have a credible source on the number of attacks or fatalities either.

While more stats need to be collected, one study found that the probability of being killed by a hippopotamus attack is in the range of 29% to 87% – higher than that of a grizzly bear attack at 4.8%, shark attack at 22.7% and crocodile attack at 25%.

‘He spat me out’

Those were rather bad odds of survival working against Templer.

“I’m guessing I was wedged so far down its throat it must have been uncomfortable because he spat me out. So I burst to the surface, sucked a lungful of fresh air and I came face to face with Evans, the guide who I was trying to rescue. And I said, ‘We got to get out of here!’ ”

So once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time, my legs are trapped but my hands are free. Paul Templer

But Evans was in serious trouble. Templer started swimming back for him “and I was just moving in for your classic lifesaver’s hold when – WHAM! – I got hit from below. So once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time my legs are trapped but my hands are free.”

He tried to go for his gun, but he was being thrashed around so much he couldn’t grab it. The hippo – which turned out to be an older, aggressive male – spat Templer out a second time.

“This time when I come to the surface I look around, there’s no sign of Evans.” Templer assumed Evans had been rescued, and he tried to escape himself.

“I’m making pretty good progress and I’m swimming along there and I come up for the stroke and swimming freestyle and I look under my arm – and until my dying day I’ll remember this – there’s this hippo charging in towards me with his mouth wide open bearing in before he scores a direct hit.”

This time, Templer was sideways in the hippo’s mouth, legs dangling out one side of the mouth, shoulders and head on the other side of its mouth.

Total fury

“And then he just goes berserk. … When hippos are fighting, the way they fight is they try to tear apart and just destroy whatever it is they’re attacking,” Templer said.

“For me, fortunately everything was happening in slow motion. So when he’d go under water, I’d hold my breath. When we were on the surface, I would take a deep breath and I would try to hold onto tusks that were boring through me” to stop from being ripped apart.

Templer said one of the clients watching the horror later described it like a “vicious dog trying to rip apart a rag doll.”

He figures the whole attack took about three and a half minutes.

Meanwhile, apprentice guide Mack in the safety kayak – “showing incredible bravery, risking his life to save mine – pulls his boat in inches from my face.” Templer managed to grab a handle on the kayak, and “Mack dragged me to the relative safety of this rock.”

The expedition was still in one hell of a mess, though.

Who gets attacked and why

People living near hippo territory are more likely victims of attacks than tourists, said Lewison.

“Most of the attacks happen in the water, but because hippos raid crops on farms, there are also attacks on people trying to protect their crops. There are some tourists, but largely the attacks are happening to local residents,” Lewison said.

Human encroachment from Africa’s booming population makes matters worse, increasing the chances of deadly interactions, she said.

Despite the encounters gone bad, sub-Saharan Africa depends on hippos.

“Hippos are important ecosystem engineers of the ecology of freshwater areas they inhabit. This is through nutrient recycling from dung (they consume large amounts of vegetation),” Muruthi said.

“Hippos attack not to eat people, but to get them the hell away from them,” Lewison said. “I don’t think hippos are particularly aggressive, but I think when under pressure, they attack.”

Stuck on a rock and in a hard place

Back on the rock in the Zambezi, Templer asked Mack where Evans was. Mack said, “He’s gone, man, he’s just gone.”

Templer knew he needed to come up with a plan to get them off the rock and to the riverbank, but “first I needed to settle myself down.”

He assessed the situation: One man missing. The first aid kit, radio and gun all gone. Six scared clients, two canoes and one paddle left. And his own body was shattered.

“My left foot was especially bad; it looked as if someone had tried to beat a hole through it with a hammer.” He couldn’t move his arms. One arm from elbow down was “crushed to a pulp.”

Blood was bubbling out of his mouth. They realized his lung was punctured. Mack rolled Templer over and could see a gaping hole in his back and plugged it with Saran Wrap from a plate of snacks.

Templer made the call: No matter the risk, they had to get off that rock.

He was loaded into a canoe. Ben paddled. The hippo kept bumping the canoe. He went from being terrified to calm on that ride back.

He described “a profound spiritual experience in which I had this incredible sense of peace and realization this was my moment of choice. Like do I go, or do I stay? Do I close my eyes and drift off, or do I fight my way through this and stick around?”

It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would. Paul Templer on the pain after the attack

“I chose to stick around, and as soon as I made that choice, it was more pain than I could ever imagine I could endure. It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would.”

Ben and Templer made it out of the river, but without finding Evans. His body was found three days later. They concluded he had drowned because he didn’t have any signs of animal attack on him.

“Evans did nothing wrong. The fact that he died was purely a tragedy.”

Meanwhile, some people on shore had realized something was wrong in the river. A well-trained Zimbabwe rescue team was able to safely ferry everyone else off the rock.

“And that was my bad day at the office.”

Next ordeal: Getting medical help

Templer was out of the river but not out of the woods.

It took eight hours to drive him to the nearest hospital. In a month’s time, he had several major surgeries. He thought he would lose one leg and both arms. His surgeon didn’t think he’d live.

But not only did the surgeon save Templer’s life, he saved his legs and one arm. The other arm, however, was beyond salvation.

He realized that in the ICU when he woke up and was feeling for his left hand. It was gone. “I just remember feeling devastated. I spent my whole life being active and it was almost more than I could bare.”

But then he was flooded with relief to realize his right arm and legs had been saved. For the next month, he was “emotionally all over the map.”

He got physical and occupational therapy in Zimbabwe and then more in the United Kingdom. He got a prosthesis “and then just started trying to get back to life.”

Templer, Muruthi and Lewison all say safe outings start with education – and avoiding trouble in the first place.

“Hippos have no interest in dealing with people. Stay away from them, and they will leave you alone. They are not hunting humans,” Lewison said.

“Do not get close to them,” Muruthi said. “They don’t want any intrusion. … They’re not predators; it’s by accident if they’re injuring people.”

Want close-up views and photos of the creatures? Instead of venturing too close, invest in good binoculars and telephoto camera lenses.

Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says ‘Stay in your vehicle,’ then stay in your vehicle. Philip Muruthi on avoiding hippo attacks

Do not walk along well-worn hippo paths, stay close to your group and don’t approach them from behind, Muruthi said.

“Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says ‘Stay in your vehicle,’ then stay in your vehicle. And even when you’re in your vehicle, don’t drive it right to the animal.”

Muruthi also advised that your party make some noise in areas known for hippos. “It’s good for them to know you’re around.”

“Hippos usually come out of water late in the evening and at night to forage, so avoid trekking along the river at that time,” Muruthi said. Also stay on high alert during the dry season when food is scarce.

Warning signals

Get to know the signs of disturbed hippos, Muruthi advised, in case you wander too closely. An agitated one will open its mouth wide and yawn as aggressive display. Also watch for a head thrown back, shaking of the head, grunting and snorting.

“These are signs you should have left already!” Muruthi said.

If you’ve attracted unwanted attention, Muruthi said to always remember you cannot outrun a hippo. They may look sluggish, but they can run 30 mph (almost 43 kph). Instead, you should try to climb a tree or find an obstacle to put between you and the hippo such as a rock or anthill.

Muruthi, Lewison and Templer all said never stay between a hippo and the water. If it’s charging you, run parallel to the water source. As with so many other protective female animals, never get between a mama hippo and her young, Templer said.

What if you’re in a small watercraft?

“Typically, if a hippo is going to be attacking, you’ll see it coming way before. There will be that bow wave. … If you slap the water, the percussion 99.9 times out of 100 will turn the hippo,” Templer said. “If you’re in a canoe and a hippo knocks you in the water, get away from the canoe. The hippo is going for this big shape, getting it off its territory.”

It’s also safer to view hippos on the water in a larger vessel, which the animal would have a harder time capsizing, Muruthi said.

Once an attack is underway

Unlike attacks by some other wild animals, humans are almost defenseless once an attack by a large hippo begins.

“Once attacked, there is nothing you can do,” Muruthi said. “Fight for dear life and watch for any chance to escape.” He said you could try to poke at the eyes or any spot that might inflict unexpected pain. But given the size just of a hippo head, even that’s a tall order.

Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn’t much you can do if they get hold of you. Rebecca Lewison

“Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn’t much you can do if they get hold of you,” Lewison said.

Based on his attack, Templer said try not to panic “when dragged underwater. Remember to suck in air if on the surface.”

Another hippo attack survivor in this National Geographic video also was able to conserve her breath. She also grabbed the hippo’s snout, and one expert in the video theorizes that might have startled the hippo into letting her go.

‘You’re the sum of your choices’

Two years after that attack, Templer said that he and a team made the longest recorded descent of the Zambezi River to date. It took three months and covered 1,600 miles (2,575 kilometers).

How did Templer find the resilience to reclaim his life?

After a particularly rough day trying to maneuver in a wheelchair, he said that his surgeon told him: “You’re the sum of your choices. You’re exactly who, what and where you choose to be in life.”

Templer said he focused on what’s possible vs. what he’s lost. “If you look for what’s possible, it generally is.”

Templer later moved to United States; got married to the sister of a journalist on the record-setting Zambezi trip; wrote the book “What’s Left of Me”; and is a speaker.

Is a safari advisable?

Should people be afraid to even go on safari – especially in hippo areas – after learning of a harrowing story like Templer’s?

Muruthi said go, but go smartly. Be sure to get advice from professional tour guides – and then follow their guidance, Muruthi said. “In Kenya, for example, contact the Kenya Professional Safari Guides Association,” he said.

Templer said his attack was an “anomaly,” and he doesn’t want anyone to be dissuaded by what happened on his 1996 river run.

“My biggest counsel would be: Absolutely go and do it. But hook yourself up with someone who knows what they’re doing out there. But by all means, go out … and experience it.”",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/hippo-attack-avoid-survive-paul-templer/index.html,1
Couple who transformed an abandoned Japanese home into a guesthouse,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter. Get the latest news in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.

CNN —

He’d spent years backpacking around the world, and Japanese traveler Daisuke Kajiyama was finally ready to return home to pursue his long-held dream of opening up a guesthouse.

In 2011, Kajiyama arrived back in Japan with his Israeli partner Hila, who he met in Nepal, and the pair set about finding the perfect location for their future venture.

However, there were a couple of major stumbling blocks in their way. To start with, Kajiyama had very little money to speak of after years of globetrotting around destinations like Korea, Taiwan, India, Nepal, Guatemala, Cuba and Canada.

He also happened to have his heart set on a traditional Japanese house, typically known as kominka, which are usually passed down over generations.

“I wanted to have a traditional house in the countryside,” Kajiyama tells CNN Travel, explaining that he was determined to find two houses located next to each other, so that he and Hila could live in one, while the other would be a guesthouse that they’d run together. “I had a vision.”

Guesthouse dream

Daisuke and Hila Kajiyama transformed an abandoned farming residence in Japan into a guesthouse. Dai

When he was unable to find anything that met his requirements, Kajiyama decided to shift his search to include the growing number of abandoned homes in the country.

As younger people ditch rural areas in pursuit of jobs in the city, Japan’s countryside is becoming filled with “ghost” houses, or “akiya.”

According to the Japan Policy Forum, there were 61 million houses and 52 million households in Japan in 2013, and with the country’s population expected to decline from 127 million to about 88 million by 2065, this number is likely to increase.

Kajiyama was driving around Tamatori, a small village located in the Shizuoka prefecture, between Kyoto and Tokyo, surrounded by green tea plantations and rice fields, when he came across an elderly woman farming, and decided to approach her.

“I said ‘Do you know if there are any empty houses around here?’ And she just pointed,” he recalls.

He looked over at the area that she was signaling to and spotted two neglected houses side by side – a former green tea factory and an old farmer’s home – located close to a river.

Both properties had been uninhabited for at least seven years and needed a huge amount of work. Kajiyama asked the woman to contact the owner to find out if they’d be interested in selling.

“The owner said that no one could live there, as it was abandoned,” he says. “But he didn’t say ‘no.’ Everybody was always saying ‘no.’ But he didn’t. So I felt there was a small chance.”

Ghost house

Japan's countryside is littered with ghost houses, known as ""akiya."" Kajiyama managed to convince the owners of this house to let them take it over. Dai

Kajiyama returned to visit the houses around five times, before going to visit the owner himself to negotiate an agreement that would see him use the old green tree factory as a home, and convert the farmer’s house into the guesthouse he’d always envisioned.

While he was keen to purchase both of the homes, he explains that the traditions around home ownership in Japan mean that he is unable to do so until it’s passed down to the son of the current owner.

“They said ‘if you take all the responsibility yourself, you can take it.’ So we made an agreement on paper,” he says.

Both he and Hila were aware that they had a lot of work ahead of them, but the couple, who married in 2013, were thrilled to be one step closer to having their own guesthouse in an ideal spot.

“It’s a very nice location,” says Kajiyama. “It’s close to the city, but it’s really countryside. Also people still live here and go to work [in the city].

“The house is also in front of the river, so when you go to sleep you can hear the sound of the water.”

According to Kajiyama, the process of clearing the house, which is around 90 years old, before beginning the renovation works was one of the hardest parts of the process, simply because there was so much stuff to sort through. However, he was able to repurpose some of the items.

During the first year, he spent a lot of time connecting with locals, gaining knowledge about the home, and helping the local farmers with farming for the first year or so.

Authentic style

He spent around $40,000 renovating the house, completing much of the work himself. Dai

Although he wasn’t hugely experienced with renovation work, he had spent some time farming and completing building while he was backpacking, and had also taken odd jobs fixing peoples homes.

He completed much of the work on the guesthouse himself, replacing the floors and adding in a toilet, which he says was a wedding present from his parents, at a cost of around $10,000.

“I’m not really a professional,” he says.” I like to do carpentry and I enjoy creating things, but I have no experience in my background.

“From my several years of backpacking, I saw so many interesting buildings, so many houses of interesting shapes and I’ve been collecting those in my brain.”

Kajiyama was determined to keep the house as authentic as possible by using traditional materials.

He saved money by collecting traditional wood from building companies who were in the process of breaking down traditional houses.

“They need to spend the money to throw it away,” he explains. “But for me, some of the stuff is like treasure. So I would go and take the material that I wanted.

“The house is a very, very old style,” he says. “So it wouldn’t look nice if I brought in more modern materials. It’s totally authentic.”

He explains that very little work had previously been done to the house, which is quite unusual for a home built so many years ago.

“It’s totally authentic,” he says. “Usually, with traditional houses, some renovations are made to the walls, because the insulation is not so strong. So you lose the style.”

Lengthy process

Yui Valley welcomed its first guests in 2014. Dai

He says he received some financial support from the government, which meant he was able to bring in a carpenter and also benefited from Japan’s working holiday program, which allows travelers to work in exchange for food and board, when he needed extra help.

After doing some research into Japanese guesthouse permits, he discovered that one of the simplest ways to acquire one would be to register the property as an agriculture guesthouse.

As the area is filled with bamboo forests, this seemed like a no-brainer, and Kajiyama decided to learn everything he could about bamboo farming so that he could combine the two businesses.

“This is how I started farming,” he says.

In 2014, two years after they began working on the house, the couple were finally able to welcome their first guests.

“It was a beautiful feeling,” says Kajiyama. “Of course, this was my dream. But people really appreciate that it was abandoned and I brought it back to life.”

He says that hosting guests from all over the world has helped him to stay connected to his former life as a backpacker.

“I stay in one place, but people come to me and I feel like I’m traveling,” he says. “Today, it’s Australia, tomorrow it’s the UK and next week South Africa and India.

“People come from different places and they invite me to join them for dinner, so sometimes I join someone’s family life.”

Sadly, Hila passed away from cancer in 2022. Kajiyama stresses that his beloved wife played a huge part in helping him achieve his dream of having a guesthouse and says he couldn’t have done it without her.

“We were really together,” he adds. “She created this place with me. Without her it would not have been like this.”

While the three-bedroom guesthouse, which measures around 80 square meters, has been open for around eight years, Kajiyama is still working on it, and says he has no idea when he’ll be finished.

“It’s never ending,” he admits. “I’m halfway, I feel. It is beautiful already. But it started off abandoned, so it needs more details. And I’m getting better at creating, so I need time to do it.”

Complete transformation

The guesthouse has three bedrooms, which are available to rent for around $120 a night. Dai

He explains that he’s unable to complete work on the home while guests are there. And while the property is closed during the winter, he spends two months as a bamboo farmer and usually spends a month traveling, which doesn’t leave him much time for renovations.

“Sometimes I don’t do anything,” he admits.

Yui Valley, which offers activities such as bamboo weaving workshops, has helped to bring many travelers to the village of Tamatori over the years.

“Most of the guests come after Tokyo, and it’s such a contrast,” he says. “They are really happy to share the nature and the tradition in our house.

“Most people have dreamed of coming to Japan for a long time and they have a very short time here.

“So they have such a beautiful energy. I’m happy to host in this way and join their holiday time. It’s very special [for me].”

Kajiyama estimates that he’s spent around $40,000 on the renovation work so far, and if the feedback from guests, and locals, is anything to go by, it seems to have been money well spent.

“People appreciate what I’ve done,” he adds. “So that makes me feel special.”

As for Hiroko, the woman who pointed out the house to him over a decade ago, Kajiyama says she’s stunned at the transformation, and is amazed at how many international travelers are coming to Tamatori to stay at Yui Valley.

“She cannot believe how much more beautiful it is [now],” he says. “She didn’t think it was going to be like this. So she really appreciates it. She says ‘thank you’ a lot.”

Why 2023 is the year to visit Mongolia,"Editor’s Note: This CNN Travel series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.

Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia CNN —

Due to its remoteness and short summer season, Mongolia has long been a destination overlooked by travelers.

But as the country moves to further open up to tourism by easing its entry conditions for international visitors and upgrading its infrastructure, 2023 might just be the best time yet to get there.

Here are 10 reasons travelers should start planning their long-dreamed-of Mongolia visit now.

A growing visa-free list

With the government of Mongolia declaring 2023 through 2025 the “Years to Visit Mongolia,” citizens from an additional 34 countries can now visit the country visa-free through the end of 2025.

The addition of several European countries, including Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain, and the UK, as well as Australia and New Zealand, now brings the total number of countries and territories on the visa-exempt list to 61.

The full list is here.

A new $650 million airport opens its doors

After years of delays, a pandemic and several controversies, the newly built Chinggis Khaan International Airport finally opened in the summer of 2021.

With the ability to handle approximately 3 million passengers a year (double that of the old airport), the addition of 500 new aircraft parking spaces and the infrastructure to support an increase in domestic as well as budget flights, the airport is a welcome addition to the country’s efforts to grow tourism.

Budget flights to Hong Kong from EZNIS Airways have been relaunched since the airport’s opening, and talks to resume direct flights to the United States are reportedly underway.

A modern new museum

The recently opened Chinggis Khaan Museum offers a beautiful, fresh look at Mongolia’s tumultuous history.

With more than 10,000 artifacts spanning over 2,000 years, the museum explores the history of the Mongols and the empire they created – and eventually lost.

The museum’s artifacts are presented over eight floors, with six permanent and two temporary exhibition halls. Guided tours are offered in English every Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. free of charge.

Mongolia’s answer to Coachella

When most people think of Mongolia, music festivals and conservation-focused art installations in the heart of one of the world’s largest deserts are the last things to come to mind.

But that’s all changing thanks to festivals like Playtime, Spirit of Gobi, INTRO Electronic Music Festival and the Kharkhorum 360 Visual Art & Music Experience.

Placing international bands, DJs, and musicians from around the world alongside Mongolia’s eclectic mix of rappers, bands and folk singers, the country just might be one of the world’s most underrated places for festival lovers.

Celebrate Naadam as it turns the century

The annual Naadam event has always been a great reason to visit Mongolia, but now that the festival has just celebrated its 100 year anniversary, 2023 is as good a time as ever to attend.

While the festival’s origins are rooted in the days of Genghis Khan, when he used horse racing, wrestling and archery competitions to keep his warriors in shape between battles, Naadam only officially became a national holiday 100 years ago.

Today, the festival – held in Ulaanbaatar at the National Sports Stadium, has a few more bells and whistles than it did during the days of the Great Khan.

A seat at July 11’s opening ceremony is always one of the hardest tickets to score in town.

Try your hand at archery the Mongolian way

Mounted archery is seeing a resurgence in Mongolia thanks to guys like Altankhuyag Nergui, one of the most accomplished archers in the sport and his archery academy, Namnaa.

Here, locals learn the fundamentals of Mongolian archery before mounting a horse and taking their new found skills to another level.

In the summer months, students and academy members put on weekly shows for interested spectators. The academy also offers day-long training sessions for those wanting to try this intense sport.

Learn about Mongolian calligraphy from a master

Speaking of giving life to Mongolia’s most ancient traditions, the resurrection of Mongol bichig, or the traditional Mongolian script written from top to bottom and read from left to right, has also seen a major resurgence in recent years.

Visit the Erdenesiin Khuree Mongolian Calligraphy Center in Karakorum to learn from master calligraphist Tamir Samandbadraa Purev about this important cultural heritage. And, while you’re there, browse the yurts filled with Tamir’s works.

Pair the release of Husqvarna’s new Norden 901 Expedition motorbike with Nomadic Off-Road’s newly announced Eagle Hunter Tour, and you have one of the fastest adventures in Mongolia.

The tour takes six riders 1,700 kilometers from Ulaanbaatar to Bayan-Ulgii, where riders eventually meet their hosts, Mongolia’s famous eagle hunters.

The only thing faster than this adventure is the rate at which Nomadic Off-Road’s tours sell out.

Winter tours offer new insights

Professional musher Joel Rauzy has been leading dogsledding tours across the frozen Lake Khuvsgul for 18 years.

With fewer crowds, lower hotel rates and the chance to see one of the largest freshwater lakes in the world completely frozen over, winter in Mongolia is something else to see and experience.

Rauzy’s company, Wind of Mongolia, offers tours of the lake, where each person is assigned their own sled and dogs for the journey. Following Rauzy’s lead, mushers will make a loop of the lake. Activities include ice fishing, while travelers stay in winterized yurts and spend time with nomadic families along the journey.

Scandinavian design hits Mongolia at Yeruu Lodge

Nestled in the heart of Selenge province on the Yeruu River, Yeruu Lodge is the brainchild of Norwegian founder Eirik Gulsrud Johnsen, who first visited Mongolia in 2017.

With a minimal Scandinavian-style restaurant and dining area, a handful of fully kitted out yurts for guests to stay in, two pétanque courts, kayaks, a driving range, mountain bikes and a yoga area, the lodge is a destination for nature lovers.

Completely off-grid, the lodge runs off solar panels, uses of thermal heating, and all of the property’s water comes from an on-property well and is recycled after use.

Additionally, all glass, metal and plastic used at the lodge is also recycled, and food waste is turned into compost used to grow vegetables, berries and herbs onsite.

Great Wall of China: Six sections with beautiful views,"Editor’s Note: Monthly Ticket is a CNN Travel series that spotlights some of the most fascinating topics in the travel world. In September, we’re celebrating superlatives as we look at some of the world’s biggest, tallest and most expensive attractions and destinations.

CNN —

Having lived in Beijing for almost 12 years, I’ve had plenty of time to travel widely in China.

I’ve visited more than 100 cities, not to mention countless towns and villages throughout the mainland’s 31 provinces.

Looking back, I’ve come to realize it was my frequent visits to different parts of the Great Wall in Beijing that were a driving force behind my desire to explore the rest of the country and, along with it, the many sections of wall that lie outside the capital’s boundaries.

Work on the Great Wall began more than 2,500 years ago, its origins dating back to China’s Spring and Autumn Period of around 770 BCE to 476 BCE. Various sections were added in subsequent eras as competing dynasties and factions sought to exert their control.

Work eventually stopped in the 17th century.

Though not a single, unbroken structure, the wall spans over 21,000 kilometers, winding through 15 provinces, 97 prefectures and 404 counties.

And while certain sections have been incredibly popular among tourists, many parts have slipped into obscurity, disrepair and sometimes oblivion.

Whether you’re planning to visit the Great Wall for the first time or the 50th, the following destinations are sure to make your trip to China even more worthwhile. (Check out the above video for dramatic aerial footage of some of these amazing sites.)

Yongtai Turtle City

Yongtai Turtle City is in north central Gansu province. Alex Sherr

The Great Wall is not simply a brick and mortar bulwark; in certain places, towers on jagged mountain peaks, fortress towns or even wide rivers count as sections of “wall.”

The Turtle City, built in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) as part of the Great Wall’s “Yellow River Defense Line,” was completed in 1608 and was home to around 2,000 infantrymen and 500 cavalry units during peak use.

Today, this fortress city is located in the Sitan Township of Jingtai County in north central Gansu province.

While there aren’t many real turtles in the “Turtle City,” the garrison town got its nickname due to its unique shape.

The south gate acts as the head and the west and east gates as the flippers. The town’s oval wall is the body, while the north gate acts as its tail. As one of the most well-preserved and truly authentic walled cities left in China today, it’s definitely worth your time.

Staying in the Jingtai County center is recommended. The ancient city is only a 30-minute cab ride from your lodgings, so you can visit whenever the light is best for photos.

When in Jingtai, try local specialties such as the five Buddha tofu and the Jingtai cold mixed noodles – both are spicy vegetarian dishes. A walk through the sprawling night market in Jingtai County People’s Square, which boasts more than 50 snack stalls, is also recommended for adventurous foodies.

Getting there: Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu province, has a major international airport and high-speed train connections from many cities in China. The drive to Yongtai Turtle City from downtown Lanzhou takes about 2.5 hours (195 kilometers). From Lanzhou Zhongchuan Airport, it’s only 1.5 hours (125 kilometers).

Mutianyu/Jiankou

The Mutianyu and Jiankou sections of wall are about 25 kilometers in length. Alex Sherr

Mutianyu and Jiankou are two parts of the same Stone Dragon – two contiguous sections of the Great Wall that together stretch for roughly 25 kilometers along Beijing’s mountaintops.

Historical records show that millions of men spent centuries constructing the Great Wall. Stand atop the wall at either Mutianyu or Jiankou, and you’ll begin to comprehend the gravity of this statement.

These two sections are arguably the two most classic examples of Ming Dynasty Great Wall surviving today, and climbing either is guaranteed to be a life-changing experience.

Mutianyu is the best portion of the “tourist wall.” Restored in the 1980s, it’s very commercial but also superbly beautiful. Visitors not up for the hike can take a cable car to the top.

To the west of Mutianyu, Jiankou is colloquially known as the “wild wall” – no ticket needed and not commercialized. That being said, as of 2020, hiking at Jiankou has become somewhat frowned upon by the local government because of safety concerns.

Mutianyu and Jiankou are less than a 90-minute drive (without traffic) from downtown Beijing, yet it’s highly recommended to enjoy a night in the countryside if time allows.

Jiankou can be accessed via Xizhazi village; if dates align, you might even be able to spend a few days with William Lindesay, world-renowned Great Wall historian, and his wonderful family at The Barracks, their wall-side courtyard home.

For lodgings around Mutianyu, The Brickyard is a superbly comfortable choice.

In fall and spring, shades of the wall’s gray brick contrast with nature’s vibrant colors. Peak autumn foliage and spring cherry blossoms provide stunning backdrops for photos.

For winter sports enthusiasts, there’s skiing and skating next to the Wall at locations not far from Mutianyu.

Getting to Mutianyu: Restrictions on applying for temporary driving licenses in China were relaxed in September 2019, so renting a car as a foreign tourist is entirely possible. (International driving licenses are not accepted in China.)

You can also hire a car with a driver for the day or take the Mutianyu Special Tourism Bus from the Dongzhimen Wai Bus Station.

Getting to Jiankou: Renting a car or booking private transport is recommended. As Xizhazi is a small village, buses are scarce so it can take up to five hours to get there by public transport, as opposed to 90 minutes by car.

Bataizi

Bataizi village sits just inside the Motianling section of the Great Wall and is home to the ruins of a Gothic church built in 1876 under the direction of a German missionary.

The church has been damaged and repaired numerous times in its nearly 150-year history; the bell tower is the only part still standing.

The juxtaposition of its ruins against the rammed-earth Great Wall makes Bataizi a unique place to spend a morning or afternoon.

After finishing your hike along the wall and visiting the church ruins, drop in to the village’s “new” church to say hello to Father Pan; if you speak Chinese, he can answer any questions about the village’s long connection with Catholicism.

Besides Bataizi, Datong should also be on your tourist map; visiting the Yungang Grottoes (a UNESCO world heritage site) and the Hengshan Hanging Temple will make your trip even more memorable.

Late summer is an ideal time to visit Bataizi, as you’ll see a wonderful contrast between the Great Wall and the lush green hills.

Getting there: Bataizi village is 80 kilometers west of Datong, one of Shanxi province’s largest and most famous cities. Zuoyun County is only 22 kilometers away from Bataizi – about a 35-minute drive.

Datong is easily accessible by plane or high-speed train from other cities in China; a taxi from downtown Datong to Bataizi should cost roughly 300 yuan (about $43).

Alternatively, you can make your way to Zuoyun County by bus then hop in a taxi.

In Datong, luxury seekers will want to head for the five-star Yunzhong Traditional Courtyard Hotel. Zuoyun County has one hotel that can accept foreigners: Zuoyun Jinshan International Hotel. Both can be found on popular hotel booking sites.

Laoniuwan (aka the Old Ox Bend Great Wall)

Laoniuwan, where the Great Wall and the Yellow River meet. Alex Sherr

As the locals say, Laoniuwan is where the Great Wall and the mighty Yellow River shake hands.

The Laoniuwan Fortress was built in 1467, while the most famous tower of the Great Wall in this area, Wanghe Tower (literally meaning river-watching tower), was constructed in 1544.

Laoniuwan village is located in Pianguan County, part of Xinzhou city in Shanxi province, just across the river from Inner Mongolia.

Late summer or early fall is a great time to visit, as you’ll avoid the potentially dangerous mountain roads during spring rainstorms, or being uncomfortably cold in a place without great infrastructure.

Along the Great Wall, there are only a few places where it meets bodies of water; of all those, this is the most stunning.

A boat ride along the river is highly recommended. You’ll be able to soak in the natural beauty of the Yellow River Gorge while marveling at the steadfast resolve of these ancient architects.

Getting there: Laoniuwan is difficult to get to by public transportation. The best option is to rent or book a car to take you from Datong to Laoniuwan via Bataizi – this way, you’ll be able to see two incredible locations along the Great Wall in one trip.

Pianguan is the nearest city, about one hour away. Pianguan does not have a train station or an airport. The only option is to arrive by bus. Shuozhou, 140 kilometers from Laoniuwan, has an airport opening later this year.

Fairy Tower

Simatai's Fairy Tower is a sight to behold. Alex Sherr

Construction on the Great Wall in Simatai began in 1373. It was expanded and reinforced periodically throughout the Ming Dynasty.

The Fairy Tower is one of the best-known towers of the wall at Simatai but also one of the least visited due to how difficult it is to access.

Instead, aim to take in incredible views of the Fairy Tower from Wangjing Tower (just a few hundred meters away). It’s a journey that will satiate even the most adventurous hikers, yet can be done without any ropes, ladders or other essential safety gear.

As with a visit to Mutianyu/Jiankou, this section of wall is guaranteed to deliver stunning views any time of year. My only suggestion is to wait for a clear day (usually visibility is great the day after it rains or snows), as the view from Wangjing Tower is unobstructed in every direction.

The hike to the Fairy Tower will leave you in awe of the Northern Barbarians’ supposed determination to reach the capital; the mountains are nearly impassable on foot, let alone by horse, with sheer cliff faces on either side.

It makes for absolutely world-class hiking and an interesting history lesson.

Five-star lodgings are available at Hobo Farm; they also have an incredible restaurant that serves delicious Western and Chinese fare. For 4.5 star lodgings with a lower price tag, try Yatou’s Homestay. Both can be found on major hotel booking sites.

Getting there: Both the Fairy Tower and Wangjing Tower should be accessed via Tangjiazhai village, located in Beijing’s Miyun district.

Tangjiazhai village is 140 kilometers from downtown Beijing, depending on your route. Booking a private car from the city is probably the most time-effective way to get there.

You can also take a high-speed train from Beijing Station to Miyun district and switch to a bus or taxi from there.

Dushikou

Dushikou stand seven meters tall in some spots. Alex Sherr

Constructed during the reign of Emperor Jiajing (1507-1567), this single-wall section stands seven meters tall in some spots – no small feat considering it was made by piling stones.

It’s located just across the road from the town of Dushikou, in Chicheng in Hebei province.

The piled-stone wall at Dushikou is unique, as many other sections of the Great Wall close to Beijing were constructed using kiln-fired bricks.

Dushikou is best visited in the summer, specifically July and August, when the rolling hills of the surrounding grasslands are peak green. Cool evenings make for perfect outdoor barbecue/bonfire weather.

You’ll be able to find clean and comfortable farmhouse lodgings in Dushikou town; alternatively, Chicheng, 45 minutes away, has a range of hotels to choose from.

Lamb skewers and roast leg of lamb are specialties in these parts, as this part of Hebei is very close to the border with Inner Mongolia. Noodle lovers should also try the local oat noodles, which are delicious.

Getting there: Thanks to all the infrastructure built for the 2022 Winter Olympics, the drive to Dushikou has been shortened by almost two hours. If you prefer not to drive, hop on a bus to Chicheng from the Liuliqiao Transport Hub in Beijing and take a 45-minute taxi ride to Dushikou.

Note that public transportation will take one or two hours longer than private car.",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/china-beautiful-great-wall-sections-cmd/index.html,1

"Nelly Cheboi, who creates computer labs for Kenyan schoolchildren, is CNN’s Hero of the Year","CNN —

Nelly Cheboi, who in 2019 quit a lucrative software engineering job in Chicago to create computer labs for Kenyan schoolchildren, is the 2022 CNN Hero of the Year.

Online voters selected her from among this year’s Top 10 CNN Heroes.

Cheboi’s nonprofit, TechLit Africa, has provided thousands of students across rural Kenya with access to donated, upcycled computers — and the chance at a brighter future.

Cheboi accepted the award with her mother, who she said “worked really hard to educate us.” At the beginning of her acceptance speech, Cheboi and her mother sang a song onstage that she explained had a special meaning when she was growing up.

As CNN Hero of the Year, Cheboi will receive $100,000 to expand her work. She and the other top 10 CNN Heroes honored at Sunday’s gala all receive a $10,000 cash award and, for the first time, additional grants, organizational training and support from The Elevate Prize Foundation through a new collaboration with CNN Heroes. Nelly will also be named an Elevate Prize winner, which comes with a $300,000 grant and additional support worth $200,000 for her nonprofit.

“The world is your oyster when you are educated”

Cheboi grew up in poverty in Mogotio, a rural township in Kenya. “I know the pain of poverty,” said Cheboi, 29. “I never forgot what it was like with my stomach churning because of hunger at night.”

A hard-working student, Cheboi received a full scholarship to Augustana College in Illinois in 2012. She began her studies there with almost no experience with computers, handwriting papers and struggling to transcribe them onto a laptop.

Everything changed in her junior year, though, when Cheboi took a programming course required for her mathematics major.

“When I discovered computer science, I just fell in love with it. I knew that this is something that I wanted to do as my career, and also bring it to my community,” she told CNN.

Many basic computer skills were still a steep learning curve, however. Cheboi remembers having to practice touch-typing for six months before she could pass a coding interview. Touch-typing is a skill that is now a core part of the TechLit curriculum.

“I feel so accomplished seeing kids that are 7 years old touch-typing, knowing that I just learned how to touch-type less than five years ago,” she said.

Once she had begun working in the software industry, Cheboi soon realized the extent of which computers were being thrown away as companies upgraded their technology infrastructure.

“We have kids here (in Kenya) — myself included, back in the day — who don’t even know what a computer is,” she said.

So, in 2018, she began transporting donated computers back to Kenya — in her personal luggage, handling customs fees and taxes herself.

“At one point, I was bringing 44 computers, and I paid more for the luggage than I did for the air ticket,” she said.

A year later, she co-founded TechLit Africa with a fellow software engineer after both quit their jobs. The nonprofit accepts computer donations from companies, universities and individuals.

The hardware is wiped and refurbished before it’s shipped to Kenya. There, it’s distributed to partner schools in rural communities, where students ages 4 to 12 receive daily classes and frequent opportunities to learn from professionals, gaining skills that will help improve their education and better prepare them for future jobs.

“We have people who own a specific skill coming in and are just inspiring the kids (with) music production, video production, coding, personal branding,” Cheboi said. “They can go from doing a remote class with NASA on education to music production.”

The organization currently serves 10 schools; within the next year, Cheboi hopes to be partnered with 100 more.

“My hope is that when the first TechLit kids graduate high school, they’re able to get a job online because they will know how to code, they will know how to do graphic design, they will know how to do marketing,” Cheboi said. “The world is your oyster when you are educated. By bringing the resources, by bringing these skills, we are opening up the world to them.”

An inspiring night of heroism and advocacy

CNN’s Anderson Cooper and ABC’s Kelly Ripa co-hosted the 16th Annual “CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,” which featured more than a dozen celebrity presenters.

“We’re so deeply honored to be here,” said actress and singer Sofia Carson, who perfomed a song with award-winning songwriter Diane Warren at the event. “Diane wrote this incredible anthem ‘Applause’ for those leading, surviving and fighting and tonight we dedicate this song and performance to our heroes.”

Actor Aubrey Plaza introduced CNN Hero Aidan Reilly, who launched his nonprofit while home from college during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic.

“From his pandemic couch, Aidan and his friends co-founded Farmlink Project,” Plaza said. The nonprofit connects excess food from farms across the US – food that would otherwise be wasted – to those who need it. “In just two years, he .. has moved more than 70 million pounds,” Plaza added.

Debra Vines – whose nonprofit The Answer Inc. supports families impacted by autism in underserved communities across Chicago – was honored by actress Holly Robinson Peete, a “fellow autism mom.”

Vines says her group has provided programming and guidance to more than 4,000 families. “Join me and be a servant for the change today,” Vines said when accepting her award.

And Emmy award-winning actor Justin Theroux brought his rescue dog Kuma, on the stage to honor Carie Broecker ​​and her nonprofit, Peace of Mind Dog Rescue.

Two teenagers making a difference in their communities were also honored as 2022 Young Wonders:

Ruby Chitsey, a 15-year-old from Harrison, Arkansas, started “Three Wishes for Ruby’s Residents,” which donates personal items to nursing home residents who couldn’t otherwise afford them.

Sri Nihal Tammana, a 13-year-old from Edison, New Jersey, started “Recycle My Battery,” which keeps used batteries out of the ecosystem through a network of collection bins.

The show also honored two Georgia poll workers, Shaye Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, whose lives were upended after false allegations that they had been involved in election fraud spread on social media.

Contribute

CNN has partnered with GoFundMe to enable donations to this year’s Top 10 honorees. GoFundMe is the world’s largest fundraising platform that empowers people and charities to give and receive help.

Review: Citi Simplicity Credit Card,"0% introductory APR for 21 months on Balance Transfers on balance transfers: One of the longest introductory periods on balance transfers we've come across, you'll get a 0% intro APR on the balance transferred for a full 21 months on Balance Transfers, which means you’ll have almost two years to pay off your balance.



0% introductory APR for 12 months on Purchases on purchases: You'll also get a 0% intro APR on new purchases for the first 12 months on Purchases. This is a helpful perk if you plan on buying anything with the card.



Choose your payment due date: A little flexibility can go a long way when it comes to managing your finances. The card lets you choose from any available payment date, whether it's in the beginning, middle, or end of the month. That way, you can set up automatic payments that are aligned with your paycheck.



No late fees: One of the most unique perks is that there are no late fees, ever. While you should always pay your bill on time, because late payments can still affect your credit, it's nice to know that you won't be charged if you do slip up and miss a payment.



No penalty APR: If you miss some payments, most credit cards will increase your interest rate to their penalty APR. The Citi Simplicity® Card never charges a penalty rate, so your APR isn't at risk of increasing due to late payments.



No annual fee: This card comes with no annual fee, which is an important feature if your goal is to pay off debt.",https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/credit-cards/landing/citi-simplicity-review/?utm_site=theascent&utm_campaign=ta-cc-co-cnn-citisimp2-ron-5-hp-sfpb&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=cnn,1
Wells Fargo Active Cash Card Review,"Unlimited 2% cash rewards -- Cardholders earn an unlimited 2% cash rewards on purchases, with no categories to activate or earnings limits to track.

There are other cards that offer higher cash back rates on certain categories, and while they can be worth it, they do require more effort. And they often are also subject to a cap and limited in what purchases they apply to. The Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card is perfect for someone that wants an easy-to-use card that still offers high rewards: you’ll earn a best-in-class flat rewards right away on your purchases -- with no limits or hoops to jump through.

$200 cash rewards welcome offer -- New Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card holders can earn a $200 cash rewards welcome offer for spending just $500 in purchases in the first 3 months. Not only is this a very competitive sign-up bonus for a card with no annual fee, but it's also one of the things that sets this Wells Fargo credit card apart from other 2% back cards. We’ve yet to come across another credit card with 2% unlimited cash rewards that also has a sign-up bonus.

12 months from account opening 0% APR intro offer -- New cardholders can enjoy 0% intro APR on both new purchases and eligible balance transfers for a full 12 months from account opening. (After that period, a go-to rate of 19.24%, 24.24%, or 29.24% Variable APR applies.) That's a great offer, even when compared to cards marketed just for a 0% intro APR. It means that this card will allow you to avoid interest on purchases and balance transfers for a full year!

Keep in mind that balance transfers need to be made within the first 120 days to qualify for a reduced interest rate and a lower balance transfer fee.

No annual fee -- In many cases, high rewards rates mean high annual fees. Not with the Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card, which sports a $0 annual fee.

Cell phone protection -- With the price of a typical cell phone in the hundreds of dollars, having some sort of insurance is a good idea. With this Wells Fargo card, you can get built-in cell phone protection of up to $600 just by paying your cell phone bill with your card. Coverage is subject to a $25 deductible.",https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/credit-cards/landing/wells-fargo-active-cash-card-review/?utm_site=theascent&utm_campaign=ta-cc-co-cnn-welac2-ron-5-hp-sfpb&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=cnn,1

A Crisis at a British Steel Mill Has Cast a Shadow Over U.K.-China Relations,"Britain has sent a parade of senior officials to China this year, part of a calculated charm offensive to thaw out relations with a country that looms large in a world order upended by the United States under President Trump.

But an emergency move by the British Parliament last weekend to take control of a Chinese-owned British steel mill has struck a discordant note amid all the diplomacy. And it could raise deeper questions about Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s efforts to cultivate warmer ties with China, at a time when Mr. Trump’s tariffs are sowing fears about protectionism and fraying trade agreements worldwide.

Britain acted to prevent the Chinese company that owns the plant, in the town of Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, from shutting down two blast furnaces, which could have shuttered the plant, cost 2,700 jobs and left Britain reliant on other countries for what it considers a strategically important commodity.

The government’s fruitless negotiations with the company, which refused subsidies to stay open, has prompted accusations of bad faith and even rumors of sabotage by the Chinese owner, which British officials rejected. But they are questioning whether other Chinese companies should be allowed to invest in sensitive industries.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/europe/uk-china-steel-scunthorpe.html,1
Inside Trump’s Rushed Effort to Deport 238 Migrants,"Nathali Sánchez last heard from her husband on March 14, when he called from a Texas detention center to say he was being deported back to Venezuela. Later that night, he texted her through a government messaging app for detainees.

“I love you,” he wrote, “soon we will be together forever.”

Her husband, Arturo Suárez Trejo, 33, a musician, had been in American custody for a month, calling every few days to assure his family that he was OK, his relatives said. Now, the couple believed they would reunite and he would finally meet his daughter, Nahiara, who had been born during his brief stint as a migrant in the United States.

But less than a day later, Mr. Suárez was shackled, loaded onto a plane and sent to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, according to an internal government list of detainees obtained by The New York Times. Around the time Mr. Suárez was texting his wife, the Trump administration was quietly invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a sweeping wartime power that allows the government to swiftly deport citizens of an invading nation.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/americas/trump-migrants-deportations.html,1
Palm Sunday Attack Leaves Sumy Residents Doubtful of a Ukraine-Russia Cease-Fire,"A gigantic, roiling cloud of black smoke swirled up from a parking lot of burning cars, as residents milled about on a sidewalk in distress, and police and fire vehicles careened past. Then the scene became more chaotic.

“Shelter! shelter!” a policeman yelled. A thin, buzzing noise, like a chain saw running in the distance, wafted down from the sky. Another Russian exploding drone, like the one that had just hit the parking lot, was flying overhead. People ran for cover.

“It’s like this every day,” said the mayor, Artem Kobzar, who had been visiting the site in Sumy, Ukraine, and dashed into the open doorway of an apartment building. “Everybody in Ukraine wants peace,” he said. “But you see, in Sumy, we don’t have a day or night of calm.”

That bombardment came on Monday, a day after two ballistic missiles struck a central neighborhood of the city on Palm Sunday shortly after 10 a.m., killing 34 civilians, including two children, and wounding another 117, according to the Sumy City Council. Russia said it had struck a military target; a Ukrainian regional governor said a military awards ceremony had taken place in the city that day.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/europe/ukraine-sumy-palm-sunday-russia-war.html,1
Airport Warned Repeatedly on Bird Strikes Before Fatal Jeju Air Plane Crash,"Investigators have not identified the reasons for the crash and what role, if any, a bird strike might have played. But the country’s transport ministry said bird feathers and blood were found in both of the jet’s engines. The remains were identified as being from the Baikal teal, a migratory duck common to South Korea in winter that often flies in flocks of up to tens or even hundreds of thousands.

The Dec. 19 meeting was not the first warning airport operators had received about birds. The dangers had been flagged for decades, dating back to even before the Muan airport opened in 2007, according to a New York Times examination of thousands of pages of government documents, interviews with dozens of people, and a visit to the wetlands surrounding the airport in the country’s southwest. Environmental assessments in 1998 and 2008 also noted there were many species of birds living close to the airport.

Most starkly, in 2020, when the airport began renovations that would include the extension of its runway, South Korea’s Environmental Impact Assessment service said there was “a high risk of bird strikes during takeoff and landing.” It advised that measures were needed to reduce the risk.

The Korea Airports Corporation said in response to questions from The Times that to prevent bird strikes it had used vehicles and noise makers to disperse flocks of birds and had conducted environmental surveys to monitor the airport’s surrounding habitats. The company said more loudspeakers were installed on airport premises after the meeting on Dec. 19.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/asia/south-korea-plane-crash-warnings.html,1
Van Gogh’s Last Painting Poses a Problem for an Idyllic French Village,"Auvers-sur-Oise, a village near Paris famed as an artist’s paradise, is also where Vincent Van Gogh spent his final days and it has long drawn tourists to walk in the tortured painter’s last footsteps. But ever since art experts identified his final work before he took his life, there has been strife in the town.

Van Gogh’s final painting was disputed for decades, because he didn’t date his works. But in 2020 experts concluded that gnarled tree roots protruding from a hillside in Auvers, as depicted in his “Tree Roots,” was made on the day he died. This finding may have settled one dispute, but it immediately stirred another, this one between the municipality and the owners of the property where the roots grow.

The main root depicted in the painting — from a black locust tree and dubbed the “elephant” by enthusiasts — abuts a public road. After the discovery of its historical value, the municipality claimed a section of privately owned land near the road as public domain, saying it was necessary for maintenance. Jean-François and Hélène Serlinger, the property owners, fought the village, and an appeals court recently concluded there was no basis for the municipality’s claim.

But the mayor of Auvers, Isabelle Mézières, has pledged to keep fighting, and she can still appeal to a higher court. After the decision, she insisted that the site should belong to the public, not private owners. “The Roots belong to the Auversois!” she wrote on social media, referring to the citizens of the region.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/europe/van-gogh-tree-roots-france-auvers-sur-oise.html,1
Head of Kuwait Specialty Field Hospital in Gaza Says Israeli Strike Killed a Guard,"Dr. al-Hamss said that the Kuwait Specialty Field Hospital’s location was known to the Israeli authorities as it had been shared through intermediaries before the attack. He added that staff were vetted and that Hamas government offices were not hosted at the medical facility.

“We’re not doing anything other than medicine,” he said.

The Kuwait Specialty Field Hospital was treating a minimum of 3,500 patients every day, according to Dr. al-Hamss.

“The hospital,” he said, “is providing a solution to the people in light of the collapse of the heath sector in Gaza.”

Since the collapse last month of a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, Israel’s military has embarked on a major bombing campaign and seized territory in Gaza. Israeli officials have said the offensive is a bid to compel Hamas to release more hostages held in the enclave.

More than 1,600 people have been killed in Gaza since the cease-fire fell apart — among the more than 51,000 killed since the start of the war, according to figures from the Gaza health ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its casualty counts.

Doctors at hospitals in Gaza have said that many of those wounded and killed in recent weeks have been children. On April 3, more than a dozen wounded children were seen in the emergency room of the Ahli Arab Hospital after Israeli strikes on a nearby school turned shelter. The Israeli military — which has also accused Hamas of embedding in schools — later said those strikes were targeting well-known militants in a Hamas command center, without naming them.

Autopsies of Slain Gaza Medics Show Some Were Shot in the Head,"The episode drew international condemnation, and experts described it as a war crime.

The autopsies were carried out between April 1 and April 5, according to the reports, after a team of aid workers recovered the men’s bodies from southern Gaza. The Times reviewed autopsy results for all the men except the U.N. employee. They were performed by Dr. Ahmad Dhair, the head of the Gazan health ministry’s forensic medicine unit.

Dr. Arne Stray-Pedersen, a forensic pathologist at Oslo University Hospital in Norway, who had been in Gaza earlier in March to train doctors in forensic medicine, reviewed photos of the autopsies and consulted with Dr. Dhair to write a summary report.

The 14 men were wearing either their Red Crescent or Civil Defense uniforms, in part or in whole, at the time of death, the autopsy reports said. Video of part of the attack shows that when Israeli troops began shooting at them, a few of the paramedics had exited their vehicles and were clearly visible in their uniforms, with reflective bands across the back, arms and legs that shone brightly in the lights of the ambulances.

The autopsy reports said 11 of the men had gunshot wounds, including at least six who were shot in their chests or backs and four who were shot in the head. Most had been shot multiple times.

One man had several shrapnel wounds in his chest and abdomen; two others had injuries that the autopsy reports said were “consistent” with shrapnel, possibly related to an explosion. While sustained gunfire can be heard on the video and in audio recordings of part of the attack, it is unclear whether there was an additional blast that might have caused such injuries.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/middleeast/gaza-medics-autopsies-israel.html,1
Jordan Says It Foiled a Plot Against the Kingdom,"The Jordanian security services said Tuesday that they had arrested 16 people they accused of plotting threats to national security involving weapons, explosives and plans to manufacture drones and train combatants, both domestically and abroad.

The statement from Jordan’s General Intelligence Department was a rare acknowledgment of threats to security in a country seen as one of the most stable in a region frequently beset by war and turmoil. Jordan has long been a key partner for Western allies in fighting Islamist militants and mediating in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The Arab kingdom, with roughly half its population made up of Palestinians, has been struggling to maintain that stability amid simmering discontent within its population over the war in the Gaza Strip and broader regional fighting — particularly after Jordan supported Israel in shooting down missiles during an Iranian aerial attack last spring.

For years, the country has also been engaged in an extended battle to combat drug smugglers seeking to move their goods through the country toward wealthy customers in the Gulf region.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/middleeast/jordan-plot-arrests.html,1
France Says It Will Expel 12 Algerian Officials,"Tensions between France and Algeria, never far from the surface, flared as the two countries engaged in tit-for-tat expulsions of officials working at each of their embassies and consulates.

In response to Algeria’s decision of Monday to expel 12 officials working at the French embassy and consulates, the French presidency announced on Tuesday that it would “symmetrically” proceed with the expulsion of 12 consular and diplomatic “Algerian agents.”

“The Algerian authorities are responsible for this brutal deterioration of our bilateral relations,” it said.

The ‘Great Moose Migration’ Livestream Captivates Sweden,"Who would spend hours a day watching moose trudge through northern Sweden on their annual spring migration? Lots of people, it turns out.

In fact, “The Great Moose Migration,” an annual Swedish livestream that began on Tuesday, may soon dethrone the opening credits of “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” as humanity’s greatest artistic tribute to the Swedish moose.

Perhaps the power transfer is already over.

“I didn’t really think it would hit,” said Arne Nilsson, 54, speaking of when it started in 2019. “I thought it would be ridiculous,” he added.

Mr. Nilsson, who grew up in the Swedish woods, was wrong. Now, he will devote six hours a day to moderating a Facebook group of over 77,000 fans, many of whom will spend the next three weeks watching moose on SVT, Sweden’s national broadcaster.

China’s Leader Courts Vietnam as Trade War With the U.S. Mounts,"President Xi Jinping of China kicked off a weeklong tour of Southeast Asia Monday, landing in Hanoi and trying to rally other nations to Beijing’s side as American tariffs threaten manufacturing networks and economic growth.

In an essay published Monday in Vietnamese state media just before his arrival, Mr. Xi called on other countries to join with China in defending stability, free trade and “an open and cooperative international environment.”

“There are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars,” Mr. Xi wrote, echoing comments he made recently in Beijing. “Protectionism has no way out.”

Mr. Xi’s weeklong tour of Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia aims to amplify that message. As President Trump’s tariffs send shock waves through the global economy, Mr. Xi is both striking back against the United States, and telling the world that he is now the leader to rely on for wealth creation and for nations that feel betrayed by the wild swings of Mr. Trump’s “America First” agenda.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/world/asia/china-vietnam-tariffs-trump.html,1

She chose Donald J. Trump, the candidate who promised to be tough on Cuba’s communist government.

She hoped he would help free the Cuban people and, in particular, put an end to a tool the government in Havana has used to soften its image around the world — one that Ms. Matos found particularly repugnant for personal reasons.

For decades, the Cuban government has sent thousands of health professionals to work in remote villages and cities in dozens of countries, where they get just a fraction of what the countries pay Cuba for their services.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/world/americas/trump-cuba-medical-missions-doctors.html,1
How Trump Might Unwittingly Cut Emissions From Online Shopping,"Fast-fashion giants like Shein and Temu have been doing booming business in the United States in recent years, in part because of a tariff exemption that’s helped to keep prices low on packages shipped from China.

Now, President Trump has ordered the loophole closed as part of new tariffs, starting with packages from China and Hong Kong. It could have the effect, probably unintended, of putting a dent in global airfreight emissions linked to the fashion industry.

Last year, 1.36 billion packages entered the United States through that loophole, which is known as the de minimis exemption and allows goods worth less than $800 to enter the country without tariffs. The largest source of shipments under the exemption was China, and most of those packages crossed the ocean by plane, according to data from Customs and Border Protection.

And that means a lot of planet-warming emissions: Flying a package across the sea is 68 times more carbon-intensive than shipping it by ocean freight, according to the Climate Action Accelerator, a nonprofit group based in Switzerland.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/climate/trump-tariffs-online-shopping.html,1

"Santa Lives in Rovaniemi, Finland. Some of His Neighbors Are Not Thrilled.","“Do these have cheese in them?” he asked.

She saw more tourists in snowmobile suits lingering by the cashier. Before they could make eye contact, she got out of there.

“I was thinking: Here we go again,” she said.

These were small impositions, but enough was enough. If you’re blond and therefore identifiable as a likely native of Rovaniemi, you can barely move around a supermarket during tourist season — and it’s all Santa’s fault.

Santa’s Hometown

A simple marketing idea, playing off a cherished childhood fantasy, has made a small city on the edge of the Arctic Circle almost unlivable for many people who live there. And it’s not just the needy tourists in the dairy or cracker aisle. It’s also the noisy Airbnbs, the escalating housing crunch, the sidewalks so crowded you can’t walk down them without bumping into people, and the car doors slamming in the middle of the night.

And it all started when the Nazis came to town.

Early in World War II, Finland allied with the Nazis, who built a big base in Rovaniemi, a Lapland railway hub. But by October 1944, the Nazis were losing and the Soviet Red Army was marching into Eastern Europe. As a little memento for the Finns and the Russians, the retreating German soldiers burned Rovaniemi to the ground.

That left a blank canvas. So after the war, Finland asked Alvar Aalto, the celebrated Finnish architect, to redesign the city. Aalto, known for his bold churches, concert halls and kitchen stools, came up with an idea: Why not remake the ruined town in the shape of a reindeer head, with the peripheral roads shooting out like antlers, to honor the area’s connection to reindeer herding?",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/asia/santa-finland-rovaniemi.html,1

There were no reports of casualties. A union for prison workers, FO Justice, posted photos on X, formerly Twitter, of bullet holes in prison walls, saying that prisons had been attacked in the north, center and south of the country.

"In Argentina, a Boom in Antarctic Cruises Is Straining the ‘End of the World’","As with other resort towns limited by geography and struggling to balance housing and tourism, Ushuaia has few options that are palatable to everyone. Proposals to expand the city limits have bubbled up, but many worry they could do more harm than good. Some within the tourism sector say pumping the brakes on both the city’s and their industry’s growth could be essential to preserving the region’s appeal as a remote, natural wonderland.

“We believe we could continue receiving many more visitors, but we also believe this is the right moment to think about how to not lose control of that growth,” said Mr. Lovece, of the Ushuaia Foundation XXI.

Last year President Javier Milei scrapped Argentina’s rent-control law, one of the world’s strictest. This left many residents in Tierra del Fuego — the province with the highest proportion of renters versus homeowners — struggling even more, according to housing activists. To bring some relief, the local authorities have in recent years imposed a moratorium on the registration of new Airbnb rentals, but they’ve been largely unable to crack down on the spread of unlicensed units.

In a statement, the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators, which represents the private-sector Antarctic tourism industry, said most cruisers stay in hotels, not private rentals, during their time in Ushuaia, and cited a “commitment to fostering a sustainable balance between tourism and community well-being in Ushuaia.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/travel/ushuaia-argentina-antarctica-cruises.html,1
Tuesday Briefing: El Salvador Will Not Return Deportee,"El Salvador refused to return a U.S. deportee

At a White House meeting with President Trump, El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, said yesterday that he would not return a man who was wrongly deported from the U.S. and sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador.

“Of course I’m not going to do it,” Bukele said when reporters asked if he was willing to help return the man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia. The deportation case is at the heart of a legal battle that has gone to the Supreme Court. Here’s what else to know.

Bukele said that returning Abrego Garcia would be like smuggling “a terrorist into the United States.” As the Salvadoran president spoke in the Oval Office, Trump smiled in approval.

Background: The Trump administration has said that the deportation was an “administrative error,” and has been ordered by the Supreme Court to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return.

Trump’s Dilemma: A Trade War That Threatens Every Other Negotiation With China,"President Trump came into office sounding as if he were eager to deal with President Xi Jinping of China on the range of issues dividing the world’s two biggest superpowers.

He and his aides signaled that they wanted to resolve trade disputes and lower the temperature on Taiwan, curb fentanyl production and get to a deal on TikTok. Perhaps, over time, they could manage a revived nuclear arms race and competition over artificial intelligence.

Today it is hard to imagine any of that happening, at least for a year.

Mr. Trump’s decision to stake everything on winning a trade war with China threatens to choke off those negotiations before they even begin. And if they do start up, Mr. Trump may be entering them alone, because he has alienated the allies who in recent years had come to a common approach to countering Chinese power.

In conversations over the past 10 days, several administration officials, insisting that they could not speak on the record, described a White House deeply divided on how to handle Beijing. The trade war erupted before the many factions inside the administration even had time to stake out their positions, much less decide which issues mattered most.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/politics/trump-trade-war-china-dilemma.html,1
Trump Administration Memo Proposes Cutting State Department Funding by Nearly Half,"The Trump administration could cut nearly 50 percent of the State Department’s funding next fiscal year, according to an internal memo laying out a downsizing plan being given serious consideration by department leaders, said two U.S. officials. The plan was drawn up as the White House pressures agencies to make significant budget cuts.

The memo, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, proposes eliminating almost all funding for international organizations like the United Nations and NATO, ending the budget for supporting international peacekeeping operations and curtailing all of the department’s educational and cultural exchanges, like the Fulbright Program.

It also proposes cutting funding for humanitarian assistance and global health programs by more than 50 percent despite Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s pledges that lifesaving assistance would be preserved.

It was not clear if Mr. Rubio had endorsed the cuts outlined in the memo, which was dated April 10. Pete Marocco, who oversaw the gutting of government foreign aid programs before abruptly leaving the department, and Douglas Pitkin, who is in charge of the department’s budget planning, prepared the document. It was also not clear how seriously the proposed cuts would be entertained in Congress, which appropriates federal dollars.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/politics/trump-state-department-budget-cuts.html,1
China’s Halt of Critical Minerals Poses Risk for U.S. Military Programs,"On Air Force fighter jets, magnets made of rare earth minerals that are mined or processed in China are needed to start the engines and provide emergency power.

On precision-guided ballistic missiles favored by the Army, magnets containing Chinese rare earth materials rotate the tail fins that allow missiles to home in on small or moving targets. And on new electric and battery-powered drones being adapted by Marines, rare earth magnets are irreplaceable in the compact electric motors.

China’s decision to retaliate against President Trump’s sharp increase in tariffs by ordering restrictions on the exports of a wide range of critical minerals and magnets is a warning shot across the bow of American national security, industry and defense experts said.

In announcing that it will now require special export licenses for six heavy rare earth metals, which are refined entirely in China, as well as rare earth magnets, 90 percent of which are produced in China, Beijing has reminded the Pentagon — if, indeed, it needed reminding — that a wide swath of American weaponry is dependent on China.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/politics/china-critical-minerals-risk-military-programs.html,1

"Pope Places Antoni Gaudí, ‘God’s Architect,’ on Path to Sainthood","Pope Francis on Monday placed Antoni Gaudí, the Catalan modernist once called “God’s architect” for his work on the Sagrada Familia, Barcelona’s world-famous basilica, on the path to sainthood.

Francis recognized his “heroic virtues” and authorized a decree declaring him “venerable,” a move toward sainthood, the Vatican said in a statement. For the next step, beatification, a miracle attributed to him would have to be verified. After that, a confirmation of yet another miracle would be required for Gaudí to be declared a saint in the Roman Catholic Church. The process can take years, even centuries.

The basilica marked the pope’s decision by noting on its website that after Gaudí died at 73, a leading prelate at the time called him God’s architect, and that the Sagrada Familia “opens hearts to beauty with its beauty.”

Antoni Gaudí i Cornet was born on June 25, 1852, most likely in Reus, Spain. He moved years later to Barcelona, where he studied architecture, earning his degree in 1878. After working on some small projects, according to the basilica’s website, “he soon became one of the most sought-after architects and began taking on larger commissions.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/world/europe/antoni-gaudi-architect-saint.html,1
Hungary Changes Constitution to Mandate Two Genders,"Emboldened by President Trump, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary on Monday escalated his culture war against what he calls “gender madness,” after his governing party voted to amend the Constitution to mandate that all Hungarians are either male or female.

The amendment proposed by the government was endorsed by Parliament, where the prime minister’s Fidesz party has a large majority. It was the latest in a series of moves by Mr. Orban to rev up his conservative base and distract attention from economic problems and a surging opposition movement ahead of elections next year.

“The international gender network must take its hands off our children,” Mr. Orban said on Monday. “Now, with the change in America, the winds have shifted in our favor,” he added, referring to the re-election of Donald J. Trump as president.

The amendment on gender included a clause that enshrined the protection of children’s “physical, mental and moral development,” reinforcing a law passed last month that banned gay pride events as a danger to the welfare of the very young.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/world/europe/hungary-two-genders-constitution.html,1

Mr. Marocco had been acting as the head of foreign aid at the department and would have overseen the remaining aid operations, which amount to only a fraction of those active before President Trump took office.

Mr. Marocco is expected to take another job in the administration, U.S. officials say.

The State Department did not provide official comment on Mr. Marocco’s departure.

Trump Calls Russia’s Strike on Sumy a ‘Mistake’,"President Trump has said Russia’s deadly missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Sumy was “a mistake,” calling it a “horrible thing” even as members of his administration went further with condemnation that served as a rare critique of Moscow while the White House is pushing for a cease-fire.

Two ballistic missiles killed at least 35 people and injured more than 100 in Sumy on Sunday morning. The attack was the second in just over a week to inflict heavy civilian casualties in Ukraine, which Kyiv has said shows that Moscow is not truly interested in a truce.

“I think it was terrible. And I was told they made a mistake. But I think it’s a horrible thing,” Mr. Trump said about the Sumy attack when he was aboard Air Force One on Sunday.

"When Elected Leaders Pursue Risky Policies, What Can Stop Them?","When Danielle Sassoon, the acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, resigned in protest of the Trump administration’s decision to drop criminal charges against the mayor of New York City, in what she called a political quid pro quo, her actions did not lead to a substantial fall in public support for Mr. Trump. Nor did her resignation impede Mr. Trump’s policy agenda. In fact, it may have smoothed its path. Another attorney dropped the charges against New York’s mayor, who remains in office.

For Mr. Trump, resignations “are an upside,” Ms. Saunders said. “They are part of the point.”

Hard limits after harder consequences

Insulation from most forms of pressure is more typical of semi-democratic “hybrid” systems, in which leaders often manage to amass so much power that they are no longer sensitive to soft limits — or even to many harder ones. If leaders are unmoved by dissent or public pressure, they may stick to damaging policies long past the point of disaster.

In Turkey at the beginning of this decade, for example, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pursued an unorthodox policy of cutting interest rates in the face of high inflation, the opposite of mainstream economic advice. He refused to change course even as inflation rates climbed to 80 percent and the cost of living soared. It was only after the 2023 election, in which he did worse than expected and had to go to a runoff against the opposition candidate, that he eventually changed course, installing a respected finance minister and a new head of the central bank to pursue a more traditional macroeconomic policy.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/world/americas/trump-tariffs-bond-market.html,1

Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has promised to “engage constructively” with China even as she has warned about the “indirect effects” of the American tariffs and has vowed to closely watch the flow of Chinese goods. A new task force will monitor imports for signs of dumping.

“We cannot absorb global overcapacity nor will we accept dumping on our market,” Ms. von der Leyen said as Mr. Trump’s tariffs went into effect.

Her tough but measured message to both China and the United States has impressed trade experts who say it may be the best chance for Europe to avoid economic disaster.

That heartbreak is perhaps most palpable in Haina, an industrial city outside the capital that lost more than two dozen people in the tragedy, including community leaders and cultural heroes.

A gritty municipality best known for its bustling seaport and a legacy of lead pollution that once gave it the unwelcome moniker “the Dominican Chernobyl” now has another undesirable distinction.

"How to Evade Taxes in Ancient Rome? A 1,900-Year-Old Papyrus Offers a Guide.","It may not have been the tax-evasion trial of the century — the second century, that is — but it was of such gravity that the defendants faced charges of forgery, fiscal fraud and the sham sale of slaves. Tax dodging is as old as taxation itself, but these particular offenses were considered so serious under Roman law that penalties ranged from heavy fines and permanent exile to hard labor in the salt mines and, in the worst case, damnatio ad bestias, a public execution in which the condemned were devoured by wild animals.

The allegations are laid out in a papyrus that was discovered decades ago in the Judean desert but only recently analyzed; it contains the prosecutor’s prep sheet and the hastily drafted minutes from a judicial hearing. According to the ancient notes, the tax-evasion scheme involved the falsification of documents and the illicit sale and manumission, or freeing, of slaves — all to avoid paying duties in the far-flung Roman provinces of Judea and Arabia, a region roughly corresponding to present-day Israel and Jordan.

Both tax dodgers were men. One, named Gadalias, was the impoverished son of a notary with ties to the local administrative elite. Besides convictions for extortion and counterfeiting, his catalog of misdeeds included banditry, sedition and, on four occasions, failing to show up for jury duty at the court of the Roman governor. Gadalias’s partner in crime was a certain Saulos, his “friend and collaborator” and the supposed mastermind of the caper. Although the ethnicity of the accused is not explicitly stated, their Jewish identities are assumed, based on their biblical names, Gedaliah and Saul.

This ancient legal drama unfolded during the reign of Hadrian, after the emperor’s tour of the area around A.D. 130 and presumably before A.D. 132. That year, Simon bar Kochba, a messianic guerrilla chief, led a popular uprising — the third and final war between the Jewish people and the empire. The revolt was violently suppressed, with hundreds of thousands killed and most of the surviving Jewish population expelled from Judea, which Hadrian renamed Syria Palestina.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/science/archaeology-papyrus-tax-fraud-trial.html,1
The Former C.I.A. Officer Capitalizing on Europe’s Military Spending Boom,"During a 24-hour swing through Copenhagen last month, Eric Slesinger met with engineers making maritime drones, developers of war-planning software and an adviser to NATO. He had recently visited London for a dinner with a senior British intelligence official and would soon head to the Arctic to learn about the technologies that could handle extreme climates.

The packed schedule would seem more common for Mr. Slesinger in his former job as an officer at the Central Intelligence Agency. But now the 35-year-old was in high demand as he parlayed his spy agency credentials into a career as a venture capitalist focused on the suddenly relevant area of defense and national security technology in Europe.

But when the congregation gathered for coffee after the service, their current worries surfaced, about how peaceful Syria’s future would be.

Would the Islamist rebels who ousted the strongman Bashar al-Assad in December ban pork and alcohol, impose modest dress on women or limit Christian worship? Would the new security forces protect Christians from attacks by Muslim extremists?

Ms. Smith, the premier of Alberta, the Western province often called the Texas of Canada because of its oil, ranches and conservative politics, is referred to as “divisive” by supporters and critics alike: People love her, people hate her, people love to hate her.

An unapologetic MAGA-aligned conservative, she has riled Canadians across the country by speaking admiringly of President Trump and focusing on her province’s fortunes, particularly its oil exports, even as the U.S. administration menaces Canada.

Musicians Who Knew Amadou Bagayoko Pay Tribute With Their Songs,"African music lost one of its titans last week with the death of Amadou Bagayoko, a guitarist who recorded with American rock stars, performed at the Nobel concert for Barack Obama, and became a national icon in his home, Mali.

With his wife, the singer Mariam Doumbia, Mr. Bagayoko composed the duo Amadou & Mariam, which rose to international fame in the 2000s and 2010s with hits like “Beautiful Sundays.”

Mr. Bagayoko was 70 when he died last week, of complications from a malaria infection. He and his wife, who is 66, were scheduled to perform across Europe next month. And while their fame has faded in the United States since the peak of their global success, they remained huge celebrities in Europe and in West Africa, where their music inspired generations of artists.

China has suspended exports of certain rare earth minerals and magnets that are crucial for the world’s car, semiconductor and aerospace industries. The move is in retaliation for President Trump’s sharp increase in tariffs.

The metals and the special magnets made with them can now be shipped out of China only with special export licenses. But Beijing has barely started setting up a system for issuing the licenses. Industry executives said that supplies of minerals and products outside the country could run low.

Trump’s rapidly escalating trade war with China has scrambled prospects for many global businesses. And there is no end in sight, my colleagues Ana Swanson and Ben Casselman report.

Ecuadorean President’s Opponent Contests His Re-election Win,"Mr. Noboa celebrated his victory from the coastal town of Olón.

“This day has been historic,” he said. “There is no doubt who the winner is.”

The day before the election, Mr. Noboa declared a state of emergency in seven states, most of them González strongholds, raising fears that he was trying to suppress the vote among her supporters. The declaration restricts social activities and allows police and military to enter homes without permission.

The president said the measure was in response to violence in certain parts of Ecuador. Ms. González described it as an attempt to curb political participation.

“Declaring a state of emergency in the middle of an electoral process due to alleged serious internal unrest is very questionable,” said Mauricio Alarcón Salvador, the director of Transparency International’s chapter in Ecuador, who added that the decision should be reviewed by the Supreme Court.

But he said that any claims of electoral fraud “must be substantiated,” something he saw as less likely given Mr. Noboa’s large margin of victory. “It cannot and should not be simply an assertion thrown into the air.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/world/americas/ecuador-election.html,1
"Mario Vargas Llosa, Nobel-Winning Peruvian Novelist, Dies at 89","Mario Vargas Llosa, the Peruvian novelist who combined gritty realism with playful erotica and depictions of the struggle for individual liberty in Latin America, while also writing essays that made him one of the most influential political commentators in the Spanish-speaking world, died on Sunday in Lima. He was 89.

His death was announced in a social media statement by his children.

Mr. Vargas Llosa, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2010, gained renown as a young writer with slangy, blistering visions of the corruption, moral compromises and cruelty festering in Peru. He joined a cohort of writers like Gabriel García Márquez of Colombia and Julio Cortázar of Argentina, who became famous in the 1960s as members of Latin America’s literary “boom generation.”

His distaste for the norms of polite society in Peru gave him abundant inspiration. After he was enrolled at the age of 14 in the Leoncio Prado Military Academy in Lima, Mr. Vargas Llosa turned that experience into his first novel, “The Time of the Hero,” a critical account of military life published in 1963.

The book was denounced by several generals, including one who claimed it had been financed by Ecuador to undermine Peru’s military — all of which helped make it an immediate success.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/books/mario-vargas-llosa-dead.html,1
"UK Laws Are Not ‘Fit for Social Media Age,’ Says Report Into Summer Riots","British laws restricting what the police can say about criminal cases are “not fit for the social media age,” a government committee said in a report released Monday in Britain that highlighted how unchecked misinformation stoked riots last summer.

Violent disorder, fueled by the far right, affected several towns and cities for days after a teenager killed three girls on July 29 at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport, England. In the hours after the stabbings, false claims that the attacker was an undocumented Muslim immigrant spread rapidly online.

In a report looking into the riots, a parliamentary committee said a lack of information from the authorities after the attack “created a vacuum where misinformation was able to grow.” The report blamed decades-old British laws, aimed at preventing jury bias, that stopped the police from correcting false claims.

"Irmgard Furchner, Secretary at a Hub of Nazi Atrocities, Dies at 99","Irmgard Furchner, whose role as a teenage secretary in the administration of a Nazi concentration camp in German-occupied Poland led to her conviction in 2022 for being an accessory to more than 10,000 murders, died on Jan. 14. She was 99.

Frederike Milhoffer, the spokeswoman for the court in Itzehoe, in northern Germany, where Ms. Furchner was tried, confirmed the death but did not provide any other information. The German magazine Der Spiegel and the German newspaper Schleswig-Holsteinische Zeitungsverlag reported Ms. Furchner’s death on April 7.

The prosecution of Ms. Furchner reflected a shift over the past decade by German authorities, who now pursue cases against lower-level workers like guards as accessories to murders because of the nature of their jobs in the camps, whereas they used to need specific evidence of murders.

“It’s a real milestone in judicial accountability,” Onur Ozata, a lawyer who represented some of the survivors who testified at Ms. Furchner’s trial, told The New York Times in 2021, when the indictment was announced. “The fact that a secretary in this system, a bureaucratic cog, can be brought to justice is something new.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/world/europe/irmgard-furchner-dead.html,1
U.S. Revives Talks With Saudi Arabia on Transfer of Nuclear Technology,"The Trump administration has revived talks with Saudi officials over a deal that would give Saudi Arabia access to U.S. nuclear technology and potentially allow it to enrich uranium, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on Sunday.

The deal — which the Biden administration had pursued as part of a broader agreement for Saudi Arabia to establish ties with Israel — would enable the kingdom to develop a “commercial nuclear power industry,” Mr. Wright told journalists in Riyadh. He added that he expected to see “meaningful developments” this year.

“We’ve not reached the details on an agreement, but it certainly looks like there is a pathway to do that,” he said. “The issue is control of sensitive technology. Are there solutions to that that involve enrichment here in Saudi Arabia? Yes.”

Asked whether the talks were tied to Saudi Arabia’s agreeing to “normalize” diplomatic relations with Israel, Mr. Wright said only that “relationships are always package deals"" and that there were many potential areas of cooperation between the two countries.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-nuclear-talks-trump.html,1
"Medic Missing After Gaza Attack Is in Israeli Custody, Aid Groups Say","Mr. al-Nasasra was part of a convoy of emergency crews sent by the Red Crescent and Gaza’s Civil Defense, another rescue service, to search for a Red Crescent ambulance that had disappeared earlier in the morning of March 23. Israeli forces had opened fire on that first ambulance, killing two members of its crew and detaining the third, Munther Abed, according to both the Israeli military and Mr. Abed, who was later released.

When the rescue convoy arrived on the scene and paramedics got out to look at the first ambulance, Israeli soldiers began shooting again in a barrage that lasted over six minutes, according to the video of the attack, which was discovered on the cellphone of one of the paramedics who was killed, published by The New York Times and later released by the Red Crescent.

Soldiers found Mr. al-Nasasra alive after firing on the convoy and detained him alongside Mr. Abed, the survivor from the first ambulance, Mr. Abed told The Times in an interview. Two other witnesses who were held with the paramedics — Saeed al-Bardawil, a doctor, and his 12-year-old son, Mohammed, who had been detained as they headed to the beach to fish — confirmed Mr. Abed’s account.

Mr. al-Nasasra was stripped, handcuffed and blindfolded, Mr. Abed and Dr. al-Bardawil recalled.

The two paramedics spoke in whispers about the fate of their colleagues, Mr. Abed said. The Israeli soldiers detaining them later questioned the paramedics, asking them for their names, ages and ID card numbers, and appeared to scan their faces with a device Mr. Abed did not recognize, Mr. Abed said.

At some point, Mr. Abed and Dr. al-Bardawil recalled, Mr. al-Nasasra was taken elsewhere and they had no more contact with him.

In all, Israeli troops killed eight Red Crescent paramedics, six other emergency responders from the Civil Defense, and a United Nations worker who happened to drive by later that morning, according to the Red Crescent and the Civil Defense.

Israel Strikes Hospital in Gaza’s North and Captures Key Part of South,"The Ahli Arab Hospital compound was first hit less than two weeks into the war, when a missile hit a parking lot on the site where dozens of displaced families were sheltering. Hamas blamed the strike on Israel, before Israel said it was caused by an errant rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a group allied with Hamas. U.S. intelligence officials later said they had “high confidence” in the Israeli account.

The Israeli military acknowledged responsibility on Sunday for the latest strike on the hospital, saying without offering evidence that the site had housed a Hamas command center. Both the military and the Anglican Church said that Israeli soldiers had called the hospital to order its evacuation before the strike.

"U.S. Nuclear Talks With Iran Move Forward, but Many Pitfalls Lie Ahead","This time the talks are bilateral, with the Europeans but also Russia and China on the sidelines. And although the United States remains “the Great Satan” for Ayatollah Khamenei, it also holds the key to restraining Israel and securing any lasting settlement. While Iran insisted on indirect talks through Oman, and Mr. Trump on direct talks, the two sides managed to fudge the issue, with Mr. Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, talking directly to Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, as the meeting ended.

“This is as good a start as it gets,” said Ali Vaez, Iran project director for the International Crisis Group. “They could have stumbled, but they agreed to meet again, they met together at the end and they agreed on the ultimate objective.”

Importantly, Mr. Trump and Mr. Witkoff indicated that their real bottom line is ensuring that Iran can never build a nuclear weapon — despite harsh demands from Trump officials before the talks that Iran dismantle its nuclear program entirely as well as abandon its missile program and its support for its regional proxies.

Iran had made it clear that such broad demands would leave it defenseless and would end the talks before they began. So limiting the goal to ensuring that Iran can never build a nuclear bomb, if the administration sticks with that, would sharply enhance the talks’ chance of success.

“The Iranians came prepared for more than an icebreaker, but with the expectation to break the logjam with the U.S., and most important, to hear directly what is the real U.S. bottom line,” said Vali Nasr, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. “If it’s no weapon, then they can negotiate on levels of enrichment, inspections and so on. But Iran does not want to get into a situation where it cannot deliver and risk more sanctions and war,” he said. “What Iran wants is pretty clear: credible sanction relief and a deal that sticks.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/world/europe/us-nuclear-talks-iran.html,1
A Chapter Closes: Hong Kong’s Democratic Party to Disband,"The Democratic Party in Hong Kong was for decades the city’s largest opposition party. It led protests demanding universal suffrage. Its lawmakers sparred with officials in the legislature about China’s encroachment on the region.

It was born in the 1990s of an audacious hope: that opposition politicians and activists could pressure Hong Kong’s iron-fisted leaders in Beijing to fulfill their promise of expanding democratic freedoms for the city of several million people.

On a rising wave of demands for democracy, the party grew to more than 1,000 members at its height in 2008. Its effort to maintain a moderate stance drew criticism, including from within its own ranks, from those seeking to push harder against Beijing. Yet moderation could not save the party’s leaders from being caught in the dragnet as China tightened its control over Hong Kong.

The midmorning strike on the city of Sumy was the latest in a string of intensifying Russian attacks on urban centers in Ukraine that have inflicted heavy civilian casualties despite the Trump administration’s push for a cease-fire.

Officials said the city center was crowded with civilians out enjoying Palm Sunday, a Christian celebration popular in Ukraine, when the missiles hit. Lively streets were turned into scenes of carnage: Video of the aftermath showed mangled and bloodied bodies laying motionless, burning cars and debris covering the road as screams and sirens wailed in the background.

What to Know About Ecuador’s Presidential Election,"In the past five years, Ecuador has experienced an explosion in violence linked to drug trafficking.

At the same time, just 36 percent of Ecuadoreans have adequate employment, according to government data, making the economy a top concern.

Xi’s Visit Highlights Dilemma for Southeast Asia in U.S.-China Trade War,"As China faces off with the United States over a punishing trade war, it is under pressure to shore up its friendships around the world, starting with its neighbors in Southeast Asia. But its relations there are complicated.

China’s leader, Xi Jinping, will be testing these ties this week as he visits Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia in the hope of blunting the effect of huge tariffs imposed by President Trump on Chinese exports to the United States.

Mr. Xi is likely to cast China as a reliable global partner in contrast to the unpredictable United States of President Trump, whose on-again, off-again tariffs have upended financial markets and confounded governments. While in Vietnam, for instance, Mr. Xi is expected to oversee the signing of around 40 agreements, including deals that would advance plans for Vietnam to accept Chinese loans for part of a $8.3 billion railway connecting northern Vietnam with China.

"How Brexit, a Startling Act of Economic Self-Harm, Foreshadowed Trump’s Tariffs","Britain has watched President Trump’s tariffs with a mix of shock, fascination and queasy recognition. The country, after all, embarked on a similar experiment in economic isolationism when it voted to leave the European Union in 2016. Nearly nine years after the Brexit referendum, it is still reckoning with the costs.

The lessons of that experience are suddenly relevant again as Mr. Trump uses a similar playbook to erect walls around the United States. Critics once described Brexit as the greatest act of economic self-harm by a Western country in the post-World War II era. It may now be getting a run for its money across the Atlantic.

Even Mr. Trump’s abrupt reversal last week of some of his tariffs, in the face of a bond-market revolt, recalled Britain, where Liz Truss, a short-lived prime minister, was forced to retreat from radical tax cuts that frightened the markets. Her misbegotten experiment was the culmination of a cycle of extreme policies set off by Britain’s decision to forsake the world’s largest trading bloc.

“In a way, some of the worst legacies of Brexit are still ahead,” said Mark Malloch Brown, a British diplomat who served as deputy secretary general of the United Nations.

Sudanese Paramilitaries Kill Entire Clinic Staff in Famine-Struck Camp,"Sudanese paramilitaries killed the entire staff of the last medical clinic in a famine-stricken camp in the western region of Darfur, Sudan, as part of a broader assault that killed at least 100 people, aid groups and the United Nations said on Saturday.

The assault on the Zamzam camp, which holds 500,000 people in the besieged city of El Fasher, was notable even by the standards of a civil war that has seen countless atrocities as well as accusations of genocide.

Paramilitaries with the Rapid Support Forces, or R.S.F., broke through the camp perimeter on Friday evening after hours of shelling. They then destroyed hundreds of homes and the camp’s main market before turning their attack on the camp’s last remaining medical clinic, according to Relief International, the aid group that runs the facility.

Hostages Still Held in Gaza Cast Shadow Over Passover in Israel,"When Yona Schnitzer, a marketing writer from Tel Aviv, attended the traditional Passover Seder meal last year, he said a special prayer for the return of all of the hostages still being held by Palestinian militants in Gaza.

Meta’s Antitrust Trial Begins as FTC Argues Company Built Social Media Monopoly,"Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, took the witness stand on Monday to defend his social media empire in a landmark antitrust trial that could dismantle a company that has transformed how the world connects online.

In a packed courthouse in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, lawyers for the Federal Trade Commission presented Mr. Zuckerberg with a binder full of dated emails and internal communications about his acquisition strategy, pushing him to defend his words. The government has contended that Meta illegally cemented a social media monopoly by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp when they were tiny start-ups, combining them into the same company, which was then known as Facebook.

“I view this all as relatively early thinking,” Mr. Zuckerberg said about an email he wrote in February 2012 in which he discussed keeping Instagram going but not adding more features. “In practice, we ended up investing a ton after we acquired it.”

Mr. Zuckerberg, who is expected to resume testimony on Tuesday, was the first witness in the trial, Federal Trade Commission v. Meta Platforms. Earlier in the day, the F.T.C. opened its first antitrust trial under the Trump administration by arguing that Meta’s acquisitions were part of a “buy-or-bury strategy.” Ultimately, the purchases coalesced Meta’s power, depriving consumers of other social-networking options and edging out competition, the government said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/technology/meta-antitrust-trial-ftc.html,1
What if Mark Zuckerberg Had Not Bought Instagram and WhatsApp?,"Kevin Systrom, Instagram’s 6-foot-5 co-founder, was 28. He often walked laps around the wood-and-iron swing set in South Park Commons while taking calls or talking product ideas with employees. Jack Dorsey, a co-founder of Twitter who identified as more of an art kid than a techie, also hung out at the same South Park playground and mused to friends about ideas that eventually became his social media app.

This was still the era when social apps were dismissed as playthings, for posting latte art or telling people what you were having for breakfast. WhatsApp, which was growing quickly internationally, was a text-messaging app without a business model. And other photo-sharing and messaging apps were plentiful, such as Color, Flickr and VSCO in photo sharing, and Kik, Skype and Viber in messaging.

Even Facebook faced questions then about whether it was a viable business. Two months after the Silicon Valley company announced that it was buying Instagram, it held one of the most disastrous tech initial public offerings since the late-1990s dot-com era.

By the time Mr. Systrom testified three months later to the California Department of Corporations — a condition of closing the deal with Facebook — shares of Facebook had fallen by nearly half from their I.P.O. price.

But in Silicon Valley, fortunes rise and fall quickly. Companies go from frivolous fancies to juggernauts in just a few years. And what may look like a shrewd business move by an executive one moment can be quickly ridiculed as a misstep the next.

How Geo Group’s Surveillance Tech Is Aiding Trump’s Immigration Agenda,"After a Honduran immigrant arrived in the United States in 2022, officials ordered him to use a government-issued app as part of an immigration surveillance program.

At least once a week, the immigrant, a former police officer in Honduras who was living in Louisiana, would take a selfie through the facial-recognition powered app to confirm his identity and location. By trading some of his privacy, he avoided being put in a detention center and obtained a work permit.

In February, he received a message: report to an immigration office so the tracking technology could be updated. When he arrived, federal agents were waiting. They handcuffed him and put him on a vehicle bound for a detention center, where he has been ever since, according to an account from his wife and Jacinta González, the head of programs for the advocacy group MediaJustice who is working with the detained immigrant. He and his wife declined to be named for fear of harming his legal proceedings.

The maker of the app he had used was Geo Group, the largest private prison operator in the United States. Over the past decade, the company has also built a lucrative side business of digital tools — including ankle monitors, smart watches and tracking apps — to surveil immigrants on behalf of the federal government.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/technology/trump-immigration-tech-geo-group.html,1
"At Trial, Mark Zuckerberg Avoids Explaining Takeovers of Instagram and WhatsApp","In a second day on the stand of a landmark antitrust trial, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, said he bought Instagram and WhatsApp because it was hard to build new apps and dodged questions about whether he was trying to snuff out competitive threats to his company.

“Building a new app is hard,” he said when asked why, in one 2012 email that was presented, he had seemed intent on buying Instagram. “We’ve probably tried building dozens of apps over the history of the company, and the majority of them don’t go anywhere.”

“We could have built an app,” he added. “Whether it succeeded or not is a matter of speculation.”

Mr. Zuckerberg’s testimony is central to the antitrust trial, being held in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The chief executive spent about several hours on Monday answering questions from lawyers as they tried to make the case that Mr. Zuckerberg saw the other apps as rivals that he needed to take out. During the questioning, which at times became contentious, Mr. Zuckerberg frequently said he didn’t remember his thought process for certain emails.

The case, Federal Trade Commission v. Meta Platforms, poses a consequential threat to Mr. Zuckerberg’s business, which he co-founded as Facebook in his Harvard dorm room in 2004. The F.T.C. is asking Judge James E. Boasberg, who is presiding over the case, to find the company guilty of using a “buy-or-bury” strategy to kill off competition by acquiring nascent rivals like Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta bought Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion and WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/technology/meta-antitrust-trial-mark-zuckerberg.html,1
The U.S. Wants to Break Up Google and Meta. That Could Be Hard.,"“Divestiture can be an entirely acceptable remedy, depending on the severity of the harm,” said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University and a former chairman of the F.T.C. “But it can be risky surgery.”

For generations, the courts have faced the quandary of what action to take in major antitrust cases once a dominant company has been found to have engaged in anticompetitive behavior. In a 1947 Supreme Court ruling, Justice Robert H. Jackson memorably wrote that if a court’s solution did not open the market to competition, the government would have “won a lawsuit and lost a cause.”

But while a court’s ruling is based on examining facts in the past, its remedy looks to the future. The goal is to free up markets rather than hobble them — and create a competitive environment that results in more new ideas, new companies, more innovation and lower prices.

The challenge is taking on new significance as regulators make a major push to rein in the tech giants in a string of antitrust cases objecting to the power they have over communications, commerce and information.

In a different lawsuit against Google, the Justice Department is awaiting a judge’s decision on the company’s dominance in advertising technology. The department has also sued Apple over its tactics to protect its lucrative iPhone franchise. The F.T.C. has sued Amazon, saying the company illegally shielded its monopoly in online retailing from competition.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/technology/antitrust-structure-deals-challenge.html,1
"Trump Tariffs Could Raise iPhone Prices, But Affordable Options Remain","On Friday, amid a tariff-induced frenzy that drove hordes of consumers to panic-buy iPhones, President Trump announced a tariff exemption on electronics like smartphones and computers. For a moment, widespread anxiety about a potential $2,000 iPhone dissipated.

But two days later, the Trump administration said smartphones and computers were likely to be hit with new tariffs targeting semiconductors, or chips. More expensive iPhones could come after all! Talk about whiplash.

Don’t panic. Even if tariffs did cause the iPhone’s price to surge, we would have plenty of cheaper options, like buying last year’s phone model instead of the latest and greatest.

The most important lesson we can learn from the turmoil: The only consistent way to save money on tech is to use devices for as long as possible, which requires maintaining them as you would a car, and upgrading only when you must.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/technology/personaltech/trump-tariffs-iphone-cost.html,1
The Techno-Utopian Seasteaders Who Want to Colonize the Ocean,"Koch and Elwartowski first connected through a Seasteading Institute-affiliated message board. Ocean Builders stresses that it is not a seasteading project — it offers “eco-forward housing solutions” — but Koch compares the seasteading movement to the American frontier and its “profound effect” on society. “In history lessons, we are learning a lot about the rise of the commoners, like it just happened somehow,” he told me. “But it didn’t happen somehow. It happened because the aristocrats back in Europe, they had to relax things, because otherwise people would just go to the New World.”

Modern society, he said, had turned stagnant. But if living on the sea, or in space, became a realistic option, “then the ruling classes back home have to think about what to do to make their countries more attractive.”

The history of seasteading is littered with cool-looking renderings that never came to be, for places with names like Oceania and New Utopia. “A lot of seasteaders are on Step 0.5: They’re just these guys on group chats thinking, Oh, it’d be so cool if we could live on the ocean,” says the British filmmaker Oswald Horowitz, who is working on a documentary about the Italian businessman Samuele Landi — a fugitive from the law who managed to live for 13 months on an 800-ton deck barge before a rogue wave hit the vessel off the coast of Dubai, killing him.

The Seasteading Institute — founded in 2008 by Wayne Gramlich and Patri Friedman, and kick-started with half a million dollars from the billionaire Peter Thiel — is one of a few organizations hoping to change that. There are those who have criticized the movement’s libertarian bent and called it a vanity project of the rich; Peter Newman, an Australian professor of sustainability, went so far as to describe one proposed project as “apartheid of the worst kind,” a dream in which the wealthy can remove themselves to futuristic ocean villages and “sneer at the rest of the world.” The fact that Thiel, a boogeyman of the left, is so well associated with the idea (despite apparently having cooled on it) is seen as a P.R. headache by companies like Ocean Builders, which sells itself as a lifestyle business, not an ideological project.

In Panama, Elwartowski expressed irritation when Thiel’s name came up in conversation. “He bought himself two decades’ worth of association with seasteading with $500,000,” he said. “I think a lot of these billionaires — like with Musk and Mars — everybody’s got to have this thing associated with them to make them seem interesting.” He pointed out that the SeaPods were registered as houseboats, not the start of some self-governing seastead community. “We’re about as interesting as these sailboats with people living on them on a daily basis,” he said, referring to the surrounding marina. “Nobody’s asking these guys, ‘Where does the poop go?’”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/magazine/seasteading-libertarian-ocean-living.html,1
"What Are Rare Earth Metals, the Exports Halted by China?","For years, the Chinese government has worked to control the export of rare earths, a group of metals used in an array of products, as common as semiconductors and lights. Now, in its trade war with the United States, China is moving to limit the market for these metals even further, which could have disastrous consequences for American manufacturing and military power. So, what exactly are these metals, and why are they so important?

What are rare earths?

There are 17 types of metals known as rare earths, which span the periodic table and are crucial to industries like technology, energy and transportation. With names like terbium, praseodymium and dysprosium, the metals are important ingredients for some of the most advanced technologies.

Rare earths can be sorted into two kinds: heavy and light. Heavy rare earths have a greater atomic weight and are typically more rare, meaning they sell in smaller quantities and are prone to shortages. Light metals, by contrast, have a lesser atomic weight. The two most important are neodymium and praseodymium, which are primarily used to create magnets.

What are they used for?

The uses for rare earths are expansive: semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence; the motors of electric vehicles; fighter jets and guided missiles used by the U.S. military; wind turbines; and LED lights found in millions of households, among others.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/technology/rare-earth-metals-china-exports.html,1
Trump Wants to Reverse Coal’s Long Decline. It Won’t be Easy.,"President Trump last week issued executive orders designed to revive the use of coal in power plants, a practice that has been steadily declining for more than a decade.

But the effort is likely to fail, energy experts said, because the fossil fuel faces some critical hurdles. The power that coal plants produce typically can’t compete with cheaper, cleaner alternatives. And many plants that burn coal are simply too old and would need extensive and expensive upgrades to continue running.

“It will be very difficult to reverse this trend,” said Dan Reicher, an assistant energy secretary in the Clinton administration and a former climate and energy director at Google. “There are a variety of forces at work that don’t paint a very bright future for coal.”

Why has coal use declined?

Once the primary source of electricity in the United States, coal plants now produce just 17 percent of the nation’s power. The main reason is that natural gas, another fossil fuel, became abundant and cheap because of the shale fracking boom that began in the early 2000s. Use of renewable energy sources, like wind and solar, has also grown a lot.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/business/energy-environment/trump-coal-power-plants.html,1
"Meta’s Antitrust Trial to Put Mark Zuckerberg, Serial Witness, to the Test Again","Seven years ago, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, testified for the first time in Congress. After a two-week boot camp by his lawyers to prep him, he answered questions in three back-to-back-to-back hearings over two days in a baptism by fire.

Mr. Zuckerberg, 40, has had even more practice since then. He has appeared before Congress eight times and testified in court at least twice, more than any of his peers at the biggest tech companies. He has defended his company, previously known as Facebook, on issues such as privacy, child safety and the spread of disinformation.

Mr. Zuckerberg on Monday again took the hot seat, this time as the marquee witness in the Federal Trade Commission’s landmark lawsuit accusing Meta of breaking antitrust law. Regulators sued the company in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia over its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, saying it used a “buy-or-bury strategy” to maintain a monopoly in social media.

Mr. Zuckerberg’s turn as a serial witness has become a potent symbol of Washington’s growing frustration with the power held by Silicon Valley, fueling attempts to rein in the tech industry. Under President Trump, tech chief executives have cozied up to the administration in hopes that regulators will take a softer hand, but so far his appointees have signaled continued scrutiny.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/technology/zuckerberg-testifies-meta-trial-ftc.html,1
What to Know About Trump’s Antitrust Efforts Against Tech Giants,"The Trump administration isn’t letting up on the tech giants.

On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission will face off with Meta in court over claims that the social media giant snuffed out nascent competitors when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp. And on April 21, the Justice Department will argue that a federal judge should force Google to sell its Chrome web browser to limit the power of its search monopoly.

Both cases, which helped set into motion a new era of antitrust scrutiny, were filed during President Trump’s first term in office. They were advanced by the Biden administration, which also filed monopoly lawsuits against Amazon, Apple and Google’s ad technology business.

Investors in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street hoped that Mr. Trump might show technology companies more deference during his second term, as he promised to deregulate industries. Some legal experts think the administration could still take a lighter hand on blocking mergers and setting proactive regulations for tech.

But so far, Mr. Trump’s appointees have promised to continue much of the scrutiny of the biggest tech companies, despite the industry’s hopes.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/technology/trump-tech-antitrust-cases.html,1
U.S. Prepares to Challenge Meta’s Social Media Dominance,"Soon after Mark Zuckerberg co-founded Facebook in his Harvard dorm room in 2004, the social network skyrocketed in popularity. Roughly a decade later, the company experienced another round of explosive growth after buying its smaller rivals Instagram and WhatsApp, cementing its place in social media.

On Monday, Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia will begin considering a landmark monopoly case involving the company — now called Meta — that hinges on a novel legal question: Did it break the law to stay dominant by acquiring the start-ups that stood in its way?

The case — Federal Trade Commission v. Meta Platforms — will for the first time try to stretch theories of U.S. antitrust law to include what regulators are calling a “buy or bury” strategy. Meta broke the law by acquiring nascent competitors to maintain its monopoly in social networking, the F.T.C. argues. Regulators are seeking to force Meta to divest Instagram and WhatsApp.

Meta has countered that it faces ample competition in social media from TikTok, Snap, Reddit and LinkedIn, and that regulators approved the acquisitions at the time. The company also hasn’t given up on settling the case: Early this month, Mr. Zuckerberg was at the White House to try to persuade the Trump administration to avert a trial.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/technology/meta-ftc-trial-whatsapp-instagram.html,1
"Trump Adds Tariff Exemptions for Smartphones, Computers and Other Electronics","After more than a week of ratcheting up tariffs on products imported from China, the Trump administration issued a rule late Friday that spared smartphones, computers, semiconductors and other electronics from some of the fees, in a significant break for tech companies like Apple and Dell and the prices of iPhones and other consumer electronics.

A message posted late Friday by U.S. Customs and Border Protection included a long list of products that would not face the reciprocal tariffs President Trump imposed in recent days on Chinese goods as part of a worsening trade war. The exclusions would also apply to modems, routers, flash drives and other technology goods, which are largely not made in the United States.

The exemptions are not a full reprieve. Other tariffs will still apply to electronics and smartphones. The Trump administration had applied a tariff of 20 percent on Chinese goods earlier this year for what the administration said was the country’s role in the fentanyl trade. And the administration could still end up increasing tariffs for semiconductors, a vital component of smartphones and other electronics.

The moves were the first major exemptions for Chinese goods, which would have wide-ranging implications for the U.S. economy if they persist. Tech giants such as Apple and Nvidia would largely sidestep punitive taxes that could slash their profits. Consumers — some of whom rushed to buy iPhones this past week — would avoid major potential price increases on smartphones, computers and other gadgets. And the exemptions could dampen additional inflation and calm the turmoil that many economists feared might lead to a recession.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/12/technology/trump-electronics-tariffs.html,1
How the Crypto Industry’s Political Spending Is Paying Off,"At the end of a three-hour hearing last month, Senator Ruben Gallego, Democrat of Arizona, sided with a group of Republicans in a hotly contested debate. He voted to advance the GENIUS Act, a bill backed by the cryptocurrency industry.

“It’s clear that digital assets are here to stay,” Mr. Gallego said after the Senate Banking Committee hearing. Breaking from the committee’s top Democrat, he called the bill a “step in the right direction.”

The vote, 18 to 6, was only preliminary, advancing a bill that will require approval from the full Senate. But in the crypto world, it was celebrated as a moment of vindication.

Mr. Gallego is part of an increasingly influential cohort in Congress: beneficiaries of the crypto industry’s largess. During a tight Senate race last year, he was aided by $10 million from super PACs financed by three large crypto companies, including the Coinbase digital currency exchange. The money funded ads that promoted Mr. Gallego’s military service and support for border enforcement.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/12/technology/crypto-congress-financing-lobbying.html,1

casey newton

What’s new with you?

kevin roose

Oh, you know, just binge buying cheap Chinese stuff online to beat the tariffs.

casey newton

Making your final Shein purchases before that company shuts down?

kevin roose

[LAUGHS]: Yes. No, I actually did buy a bunch of stuff over the weekend, because I thought this might be my last chance.

casey newton

Yeah.

kevin roose

Casey, what cheap overseas good are you going to miss most after the tariffs kick in?

casey newton

Oh, I feel — the thing — I was never a big, like, oh, I got to go onto Temu and get a pressure cooker for $6 or whatever. Like, that was never my journey. But I know that it’s a major pastime for a lot of people.

kevin roose

Yeah.

casey newton

Yeah.

kevin roose

Yeah. Well, for me, it’s like, the ability to buy cheap crap for my kid has been revolutionary.

casey newton

Mm. Mm-hmm.

kevin roose

My kid, the other day, starts saying the phrase, dinosaur unicorn. And I thought, that’s not real. And he says, I want a dinosaur unicorn. And I said, well, that’s not a thing. We can’t have that. But then this little bell goes off in my mind that says, someone out there has made a dinosaur unicorn something.

casey newton

Almost certainly.

kevin roose

My wife finds like eight different dinosaur unicorn T-shirts and buys one of them. And now he’s got this dinosaur unicorn T-shirt that he absolutely loves. That would not happen in a tariffs world.

casey newton

As of today, that shirt costs over $400.

kevin roose

[LAUGHS]: Yes.

casey newton

Yeah. Well, I mean, I’m sure Jude looks great in that.

kevin roose

He does. He does. And he’s going to have to wear it for —

casey newton

A long time.

kevin roose

— 10 years.

[laughs]

I hope it stretches. [THEME MUSIC] I’m Kevin Roose, a tech columnist from The New York Times.

casey newton

I’m Casey Newton from Platformer.

kevin roose

And this is “Hard Fork.”

casey newton

This week, the tech world is in chaos over Trump’s tariffs. Then, AI researcher Daniel Kokotajlo returns to the show to discuss a fascinating new set of predictions for how AI could transform the world in just the next few years. And finally, did Meta cheat on an important AI benchmark? [THEME MUSIC]

kevin roose

Well, Casey, for the second week in a row, we have been interrupted by news about these Trump tariffs. Now, there was a time in the history of the “Hard Fork” podcast where the only thing that would cause us to rip up a segment and rerecord it was if Sam Altman had been fired or rehired. But now we live in this new reality where news can change on a dime. And over the past few days, that is exactly what we’ve seen.

casey newton

I think it’s fair to say “Hard Fork” has been hit harder by the tariffs than any other company.

kevin roose

[LAUGHS]: That’s true. That’s true. We are bracing ourselves for massive impact and getting ready for the new reality.

casey newton

Yeah.

kevin roose

So Casey, every great era deserves a name. And I think we should call this era in the technology industry the chaos meta — nothing to do with Meta, the company. But in video gaming, metas are the overall set of conditions that the players have to navigate. And I think it’s fair to say that chaos and the lack of certainty surrounding what Donald Trump is going to do on any given day is the new meta for Silicon Valley’s largest companies.

casey newton

Yeah. Remember how, when we were talking about whether or not TikTok would be banned, which also had a lot to do with what Trump wanted, we talked about how it was kind of simultaneously alive and dead at the same time? Now that’s just the entire US economy, Kevin.

kevin roose

Yes. So as of early this week, it looked like we were going to get these massive tariffs on goods imported to the United States from many, many countries all over the world, larger than any tariffs we’ve seen in the recent history of this country. Then, on Wednesday, as we were taping our episode, we got the news that the Trump administration was pushing pause on most of them. Most of these reciprocal tariffs on countries like Vietnam and India were going to be delayed for 90 days. And there would be a baseline 10 percent tariff rate applied, but not the much higher rates that people had been fearing, except for China, which would have its tariffs increased. And on Thursday, we learned that those tariffs would actually be 145 percent on Chinese goods entering the US.

casey newton

The problem is, with a podcast, we can’t just have a little ticker on the bottom that shows you what the current tariff is.

kevin roose

Yes. But what we saw earlier this week was that the stock prices of all the biggest US tech companies took a dramatic nosedive. That was in response to these fears about these very high reciprocal tariffs. Now, after the news that these tariffs are going to be placed on a 90-day hold, except for China, some of these stock prices have rebounded. Apple, in particular, had its biggest trading day in many years after the news of these tariffs being delayed came out. So the stock market whiplash is part of the setting for the tech companies that they have to deal with now. But the bigger picture scenario is that doing business in Trump’s America is turning out to be very difficult, not because the administration is necessarily unfriendly to these businesses, but because there’s just so much fast-moving news that it is hard for businesses to do any kind of planning or strategy at all.

casey newton

Well, I mean, I wouldn’t say this is a particularly business-friendly set of announcements that have been made. I mean, sure. I guess it’s friendlier to pause the tariffs than to continue them. But the general chaos, Kevin, I think, has been really bad for American companies.

kevin roose

Yeah. So even beyond the tariffs, there are a bunch of things that the Trump administration has been doing that have impacted the tech industry — restrictions on immigration, cuts to science funding, these antitrust cases, many of which are still going forward. So I wanted to give our listeners a sense of how this instability feels on the ground in Silicon Valley to the biggest tech companies. And you had a really smart idea, which was to look at the new chaos meta of Trump’s second term through the lens of four tech companies. So today, we’re going to take a look at how Trump’s new policies and these tariffs have affected four companies — Apple, Nintendo, TikTok, and Meta, all of which have faced significant challenges since Trump took office, and all of which are now trying to figure out, how do we go forward? What do we do? How do we navigate this new, uncertain climate?

casey newton

Yeah.

kevin roose

So let’s start with Apple. Casey, what is going on with Apple?

casey newton

Well, look. Of all of the tech companies, Apple has long been the most dependent on China. That is where 90 percent of iPhones are made. The company is just heavily dependent on its supply chain relationships that it has in that country. So the fact that these tariffs are now 145 percent on goods coming out of China has just really sent a shiver through that company. Earlier this week, Apple had its worst four-day trading period since the year 2000. Once the pause was announced, its stock has started to come back. But this is a very volatile situation for them. And the underlying dynamics are the same, which is that it is simply going to be much more expensive for Apple to sell goods made in China here in the United States, Kevin.

kevin roose

Yeah. And obviously, one of the hopes of these tariffs is that it will drive manufacturing back to the United States. There’s some hope among members of the Trump administration that this could even force Apple to consider making the iPhone in the United States. Do you think that is likely, and why?

casey newton

No. And in fact, I think it’s almost sort of worse, Kevin, because this week, the president’s press secretary said that the president believes that iPhones can be made in the United States, despite the fact that we know that it is much more expensive to manufacture things here in this country, right? It’s very important to remember that whatever the Trump administration might hope that these tariffs accomplish, they have not accompanied it with any plan to increase the manufacturing capacity in this country. The whole thing is just a wish and a prayer that at some point in the future, Apple might have a magical iPhone factory stocked with Americans who want to do those jobs. As it stands now, that doesn’t exist.

kevin roose

Yeah. So I would say Apple is somewhat unique among tech companies, because it has also been thinking about tariffs and the effect of Trump’s policies on their business for longer than many of their competitors. I mean, if you’ll remember, during the first Trump term, there was some talk about tariffs on Chinese goods. Apple successfully negotiated its way out of those, sort of got an exemption. And in part, they did that by cozying up to the Trump administration by promising to build and assemble some of their products in the United States. There was this famous tour that Tim Cook gave Donald Trump of this facility in Austin, Texas, where he said they were going to start making a bunch of stuff. So they sort of managed to get the tariffs off their back during the first term. But in the second term, it’s not at all clear that they are going to have the same kind of success. So, Casey, how is Apple dealing with the new chaos meta?

casey newton

Well, they are trying to get as many devices as they can out of China and into places where it’s going to be much less expensive to export them to the United States. So there was a great story this week in The Times of India that, according to senior Indian officials, Apple transported five cargo planes full of iPhones and other products from India to the United States, which calls to mind those scenes at the end of the Vietnam War, when you see the last helicopter leaving Saigon, except it’s full of iPhones. Actually, Katie Notopoulos had a great joke on Threads today. She said that this whole thing is like the movie “Dunkirk,” but for iPhones. Reuters reported that Apple transported 600 tons of iPhones, Kevin, which would have been about 1.5 million devices. And look, those iPhones will pad Apple’s profits a little bit more. But pretty soon, there’s going to be no more planes out of no more countries to escape these tariffs. It is just going to be a really expensive-ass iPhone.

kevin roose

Do you think the iPhone 16 Pro Maxes get to sit in first class on the plane?

casey newton

Yeah.

kevin roose

[LAUGHS]: They put them up front in the lie-flat seats.

casey newton

Yeah. They should definitely get the upgrade, with what they’re paying for those things.

kevin roose

Yeah. So OK, let’s move to our next case study of a company trying to deal with the uncertainty and chaos of the Trump administration, Nintendo. Casey, what is going on with Nintendo?

casey newton

Well, so Kevin, as a hardcore gamer, obviously, you know that the Switch 2 is coming out this year. This is the sequel to Nintendo’s best-selling console of all time. And it was supposed to become available for preorders this very Wednesday. But then tariff chaos started happening. And Nintendo said, we are going to pause preorders because we don’t know what it’s actually going to cost to sell a Switch 2 in America anymore.

kevin roose

Yeah. And now that Trump has paused these tariffs on most countries other than China, have they said that actually, they’re going to start shipping the Switch 2 on time after all?

casey newton

Well, what they’ve said is that they’re not planning to change the launch date, which is June 5. And it does seem like because they are a Japanese company and make the Switch 2 in Vietnam, they are going to be able to avoid the really tough tariffs that Apple is facing. Before Trump initiated the pause, there was going to be a 46 percent tariff on the Switch 2. Now it’s back down to that 10 percent. But look. The Switch 2 is already planning to go on sale for $450, which is $150 more than the original Switch sold at launch. So I think there’s a very real question here of whether the price of this console goes up over time, which would be a reversal of the usual trend, which is, a console goes on sale for a high price, and that price comes down over time. So once again, Kevin, there’s just real chaos here as we await probably the most hotly anticipated piece of hardware to launch, I would say, in the United States this year.

kevin roose

Yeah. Now, are they bringing in planes full of Switch 2s from Vietnam or wherever they’re manufacturing them?

casey newton

They were actually able to put them in one of those pipes. And you just sort warp down. It’s kind of a really cool little thing they have there.

kevin roose

[LAUGHS]: I got it. OK, next company on our list, TikTok. Casey, this is a company we have talked about a lot on this show. They were going to be banned. The deadline for banning them got pushed out by another 75 days last week. Casey, what is the latest on TikTok and how it is coping with this escalating trade war between China and the US?

casey newton

Well, Kevin, what is going on with TikTok is, of course, the question asked most in the history of “Hard Fork.” And what was going on with it until tariff chaos was that it looked like we might have a deal. There was some great reporting in The Times this week that ByteDance, with the support of the Chinese government, had reached the rough outlines of an agreement in which TikTok would create a new American entity. American investors would own the majority of it. Chinese owners would have about a 20 percent stake. And the American company would essentially rent the algorithm from ByteDance. And so, by Thursday of last week, there was this draft executive order that outlined the deal. And then Trump did the thing with the tariffs. And all of a sudden, ByteDance has to call up the White House and say, that deal that you just helped us negotiate, it’s off the table, because the Chinese government isn’t going to support the deal anymore.

kevin roose

Right. So this was a pretty dramatic reversal. And it does seem like they got very close to a deal before these tariffs. What is happening now that these tariffs are on? Does TikTok have any options left?

casey newton

Well, Kevin, along with a 90-day tariff pause, we also now have a 75-day extension that comes after the original 75-day extension that Trump gave in order to force ByteDance to divest TikTok.

kevin roose

This man loves extensions. Let’s just say it. This man loves to come up right against a deadline and say, you know what? You got a little more time.

casey newton

Yeah. Well, look. I don’t know what’s going to happen over these next 75 days. I imagine that if the tariffs against China stand at 145 percent, there is no way the Chinese government is going to support the sale of TikTok. And I just want to say how self-defeating this is, because it was barely more than a week ago that Trump was telling reporters that Beijing, if they would simply go along with his plan to force the divestiture of TikTok, then he would go easy on them on tariffs. This was his big bargaining chip of, if you don’t want high tariffs, you have to let the Americans have TikTok. And to my surprise, it seemed like the Chinese government was actually going to go along with that. And then, before they could even get that deal out, Trump, seemingly out of nowhere, announces a brand-new set of tariffs that completely scuttles the deal. So it is as if the president was essentially negotiating against himself and lost the deal that he had won.

kevin roose

Yeah, it does seem strange that he would not wait until after the TikTok deal was finalized and approved by all the relevant officials to then issue these tariffs, if he was actually interested in getting a deal done.

casey newton

Yeah. I think that’s right.

kevin roose

So, OK, TikTok is still in this frustrating state of superposition, where they are both dead and alive at the same time. Do we think that this resolves before the end of the next 75-day extension? Or do we think we will need yet another extension to figure out what we’re doing with TikTok?

casey newton

My assumption is that on the day that Donald Trump leaves office, we will still be in the middle of one of these extensions. It’ll be like the 15th extension, the 23rd extension. But no. Until this tariff situation gets resolved, I do not expect TikTok’s fate to be resolved. It is just going to continue to exist in its weird limbo.

kevin roose

All right. So that is TikTok. Our last company on this list of case studies is Meta. Casey, how is Meta dealing with this new uncertain reality?

casey newton

Well, I would say that things turned out a little bit better for them this week than maybe it looked like things were going, because tariffs were going to be a huge problem for them too. They are a digital advertising business. And a huge number of their advertisers are small and medium-sized businesses that buy ads outside the United States to export goods from foreign countries into the United States. Mike Isaac at The Times had a great piece on this this week. There’s one analyst who estimates that about $10 billion of Meta’s revenue from ads originates from outside the United States. So in a world where everyone was facing these massive tariffs, we were just expecting Meta to get hit really hard on the ads front. Well, now that has mostly gone away, at least for the next 90 days. So it seems like Meta is going to get some breathing room. But there is this one other outstanding question, Kevin, which is that next week, Meta’s antitrust case is going to trial. So in 2020, during the first Trump administration, the Federal Trade Commission files an antitrust lawsuit and tries to break off Instagram and WhatsApp from Meta. It has been in the planning stages ever since. And on Monday, the case is set to go to trial. So why does all of this have anything to do with Trump? Well, Mark Zuckerberg has been giving Trump the full court press, going so far as to buy a $23 million house in Washington, DC recently just to get closer to and spend more time with the president. There’s been some reporting that Zuckerberg was in the White House trying to negotiate a settlement with Trump just within the past few days. So there’s a lot of questions right now about whether Zuckerberg will be able to use this relationship that he’s apparently been building with Trump in order to get rid of this case, which is, in some ways, an existential threat to his business.

kevin roose

Yeah. And we should also just say, this shouldn’t be possible. The FTC is supposed to be an independent agency that has its own enforcement agenda and brings its own cases that are independent from the president. But of course, nothing is truly independent from the president in Trump’s Washington. He recently announced that he was getting rid of the two Democratic commissioners on the Federal Trade Commission. And that is historically quite unusual, for a president to intervene in FTC commissioner staffing at that level. But now it is going to be staffed with people who are friendly to the Trump administration. And so, presumably, if he were to go to them and say, hey, let’s back off this Meta case, I don’t actually think we need to proceed with this, they might listen.

casey newton

And we should say that another way that Meta tried to ensure that this happened is that after the events of January 6, Meta suspended Trump from its platform for three years. And Trump sued them over that. And so after he won the presidency, Zuckerberg came along and said, Hey, why don’t we settle this too? and paid Trump $25 million. And I have to say, Meta was completely within its rights to suspend an account. They’re allowed to suspend whatever account they want. It’s a private company with a private platform. But still, just as a little gesture of goodwill, hey, Trump, here’s $25 million. So if this actually happens, and this lawsuit just goes away, it will just frankly be an example of open corruption.

kevin roose

OK. So that is our four-company case study of how tech companies are trying to do business and survive in this new, uncertain environment. I have to ask. After going through all these examples, which of these companies would you be, if you could be one? Which do you think is in the best position in this new chaotic environment?

casey newton

Hmm. Well, until maybe Wednesday, I think I would have said Apple. Apple makes the iPhone. The iPhone is the most lucrative product in the history of the technology industry. And even despite some of the tariffs that we were seeing, it seemed like they were still going to be in a good position to navigate them. I was seeing analysis that they were only going to lose maybe 7 points of profitability from all this. But the world looks really different with a 145 percent tariff, and in a world where Trump just keeps escalating this fight more and more. And so I actually do think that the picture for Apple just looks really strange. So look. I feel a little crazy saying this, but maybe I actually would just rather be Meta. Their hardware business is still a relatively small part of what they do. Mostly, what they do is a digital services business. And it seems like Zuckerberg has been able to make at least some inroads with the Trump administration. Maybe they’re about to get rid of this lawsuit against them. So, God, I don’t know. Maybe I actually want to be Meta. How about you?

kevin roose

Yeah, I think — I mean, as venal and corrupt as it would be for these naked attempts at flattery and persuasion to actually work and pay off, I would not underestimate how well this stuff works with Donald Trump. And I think that Mark Zuckerberg’s motive here is to win at all costs. And if he needs to buy a $23 million mansion, or spend time in the White House, or even make some policy adjustments to appease the Trump administration and get what he wants, I think he’s demonstrated very clearly that he’s willing to do that. My last question on this, Casey, is about this idea of the tech capitulation to Trump. In the past few months, we’ve observed, we’ve talked about the fact, that a lot of these tech companies have been really falling all over themselves to appease the Trump administration. Many of them gave to the inaugural. Many of them showed up at inauguration. Their CEOs were seated just behind the president’s own family. The amount of flattery and ass-kissing going on here for months now has been, I would say, notable and historic. Do you think that any of that has worked to the degree that these executives thought it would? Did the tech leaders get what they wanted out of Donald Trump?

casey newton

I think that until the tariffs, the answer was basically yes. And the tariffs are what have changed that equation, right? If you look at how JD Vance was talking when he went to Europe, he was echoing a lot of tech company talking points. He and Trump have criticized European fines against tech companies, saying, we need to protect and defend our American tech companies against these European fines, which was something that the Biden administration never, ever did. They’ve talked about getting rid of AI guardrails and just letting these companies do whatever they want with AI, which is like music to Mark Zuckerberg’s ears. But look. These companies just rely on stable, normal governance to be able to conduct their business around the world. They are as plugged into the interconnected global economy as anyone else, arguably more than many companies. And Trump just came along and blew that up. And I think that it is probably dawning on them that they are probably just going to be living in chaos for the foreseeable future. And it is just going to make their lives much, much more difficult.

kevin roose

Yeah, I think that’s right. And I think that a lot of these executives have underappreciated how important stability and predictability are in their business models. I mean, these were companies, many of them, that had issues with the Biden administration. The Biden administration had issues with them. But at least with the Biden administration, these companies knew where they stood. There was not this sort of day-to-day whiplash of stock price moving up 10 percent, down 10 percent, tariffs going up to 145 percent and then down to 10 percent. It just was not the kind of frenetic environment that we’re seeing today. And so I wonder if any of them are starting to appreciate how good they had it during the Biden years, where, as much as the Biden administration may have gone after them for various things, including antitrust violations, at least they could wake up every day and understand what the world was going to look like for the next 24 hours.

casey newton

Yeah, I think that’s true. I think that most of them would probably still be loath to admit it. But let’s give it another few weeks, Kevin, and another few tariffs. And then let’s check back in with them.

kevin roose

Sounds good. [MUSIC PLAYING] Well, that’s enough about tariffs, Casey. When we come back, we’re going to talk about a terrifying new report about what AI could look like in 2027. [MUSIC PLAYING] Well, Casey, today, we’re going to talk about a forecast.

casey newton

And that’s separate from a Fork-cast, which is something different.

kevin roose

Yeah. That’s what we call our end-of-the-year predictions episode, isn’t it?

casey newton

I think so.

kevin roose

But today, we’re talking about something different, which is this new report called AI 2027. This is a report that I wrote about last week and that has gotten a lot of attention in AI circles and policy circles this week. It was produced by the AI Futures Project, a Berkeley-based nonprofit led by Daniel Kokotajlo, who listeners of this show may remember was a former OpenAI employee who left the company last year and became something of a whistleblower, warning about their reckless culture, as he called it, and is now spending his time trying to predict the future of AI.

casey newton

Yeah. And of course, lots of people are trying to predict the future of AI. But what gives Daniel a lot of credibility here is that in 2021, he tried to predict what things would look like about now. And he just got a lot of things right. And so when Daniel said, hey, I’m putting together a new report on what I think AI is going to look like in 2027, a lot of close AI observers said, oh, this is really something to read.

kevin roose

Yeah. And he didn’t just do this alone. He also partnered with a guy named Eli Lifland, who is an AI researcher and a very accomplished forecaster. He’s won some forecasting competitions in the past. And the two of them, along with the rest of their group, and Scott Alexander, who writes the very popular “Astro Codex 10” blog, put together this very detailed, what they call a scenario forecast. Essentially, it’s a big report, a website. It’s got some research backing it up. And it basically represents their best attempt to synthesize everything they think is likely to happen in AI over the next few years into a readable narrative.

casey newton

Yeah. And if that sounds a little dull to you, I’m telling you, you should just go check this thing out. It’s at ai-2027.com. And it’s just super readable. And it blows through stuff that feels very familiar right now, like just basic extrapolating from where we are today into, getting to six months, a year from now, the world starts to look very, very different. And there is a lot of research that they have to support why they think that is plausible.

kevin roose

Yeah. And I can imagine people reading this report or listening to us talking about it and say, well, that sounds like science-fiction to me. And we should be clear. It is science-fiction. This is a fictionalized narrative that they have put together. But I would say, it is also grounded in a lot of empirical predictions that can be tested and confirmed or verified. It’s also true that some science-fiction ends up becoming reality. If you look at movies about AI from past decades, a lot of the things in those movies did end up actually being built. So I think this report, while it may not be 100 percent accurate, at least represents a very rigorous and methodical attempt to sketch out what the future of AI might look like.

casey newton

And here’s my bet. If you put this conversation into a time capsule and revisited it in two years, in 2027, my guess is, we’re going to find that a good number of things in that scenario actually did come true.

kevin roose

I hope we’re still doing a podcast in two years. That’d be good.

casey newton

That’d be great.

kevin roose

Yeah. So my forecast is that this is going to be a good conversation. Let’s bring in Daniel Kokotajlo. [MUSIC PLAYING] Daniel Kokotajlo, welcome back to “Hard Fork.”

daniel kokotajlo

Thank you. Happy to be here.

kevin roose

So you have just led this group that put together this giant scenario forecast, AI 2027. What was your goal?

daniel kokotajlo

So our goal was to predict the future using the medium of a concrete scenario. There is a small but exciting literature of attempts to predict the future of AI that use other methods, which is also very important, things like defining a capabilities milestone. Like, here’s my definition of AGI. Here is my forecast for how long we’ll have until AGI based on these reasons and stuff. And that’s great. And we’ve done that stuff before. We did a lot of that in the run-up to this scenario. But we thought it would be helpful to have a actual, concrete story that you can read. And part of the reason why we think this is important is that it forces you to think about everything and integrate it all into a coherent picture.

kevin roose

Well, I want to ask you a bit more about that. So the first thing I want to say about AI 2027 is, it’s an extremely entertaining read. Like, it is as entertaining as most of the sci-fi that I have read. By the end of it, you get into scenarios where humanity’s survival is threatened. And so whether you think it’s true or false, it is really engaging to read. But my understanding of your aim here is that there is something practical about what you are trying to do. Can you tell us about the practical idea of going through this exercise?

daniel kokotajlo

Yeah. Well, I mean, important background context — the CEOs of OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind have all publicly stated that they’re building AGI, and even that they’re building superintelligence, and that they think that they can succeed by the end of this decade. And that’s a really big deal. And everyone needs to be paying attention to that. I think a lot of people dismiss that as hype. And it’s a reasonable reaction to say, oh, they’re just hyping their product. But it’s not just the CEOs saying this. It’s also the actual researchers at the companies. And it’s not just people at the companies. It’s also various independent people in academia and so forth. And then also, you don’t just have to trust people’s word for it. If you actually look at the evidence, it really does seem strikingly plausible that this could happen by the end of this decade. And then, if it does happen, things are going to go crazy in some way or other. It’s hard to predict exactly how. But obviously, if we do get superintelligent AGI, what happens next is going to look like sci-fi. It will be — it’ll be straight out of a sci-fi book, except that it will be actually happening.

kevin roose

You mentioned that if what the CEOs of tech companies say comes true, we will be living in a sci-fi world. And I think, for a lot of people, they’re content to stop thinking there, right? They might be willing to admit, OK, yeah, if you invent superintelligence, things will probably be crazy. But I’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. You’re sort of taking a different approach and saying, no, you’re going to want to start thinking right now about what it would be like if some of these claims start to come true. So maybe we could get into what some of those claims are. Sketch out for us what you think is very likely to happen just within the next couple of years.

daniel kokotajlo

Well, I wouldn’t say very likely. I should express my uncertainty, right? So past discussion often focuses on a single milestone, like artificial general intelligence or superintelligence. We broke it down into a couple of different milestones, which we call superhuman coders, superhuman AI researchers, superintelligent AI researchers, and then broad superintelligence. So we make our predictions for each of these stages. Even the very first one, I’m only like 50 percent confident that it will happen by the end of 2027, so 50 percent chance that 2027 will end, and there still won’t be any autonomous superhuman coding agents.

casey newton

But it’s a coin flip. We might also be living in a world where, yes, you do have — yeah.

daniel kokotajlo

Exactly. So 50 percent chance we do have fully autonomous artificial intelligences that can basically do the job of the cracked engineers by 2027. And then you say, OK, well, what’s the next milestone after that? After that comes automating the full AI research process instead of just the coding, because AI research is more than just coding. And how long does it take to get to that? Well, we have our guesses. And in our scenario, it happens like six months later. So in our story, get the superhuman coders. Use them to go even faster, to get to the superhuman AI researchers that are able to do the whole loop. That really kicks things off. And now you’re going much faster. How much faster? We say 25 times faster for the algorithmic progress, at least. Of course, your compute scale-up is not going any faster at all, because you still have the same amount of compute. But you’re able to do the algorithmic progress 20 times faster, 25 times faster. Then you start getting to the superhuman regime. So you start getting systems that are just qualitatively superior to the best humans at stuff. And they’re also probably discovering new paradigms. So we depict them going through multiple paradigm shifts over the course of the second half of 2027, ending up with something that’s just vastly superior to humans in every dimension by the end.

kevin roose

Yeah. Let me just pause and maybe underline a couple of things there. I think most people might not understand why the big AI labs are obsessed with automating coding. Most people are not software engineers. So they kind of don’t care how much of it is automated. But by the time you get to software that is mostly writing itself, it unlocks this other world of possibilities. And you just sort of sketch out a vision where, once we get to a point where the AI coding systems are better than almost every human engineer, or maybe every human engineer, then this other thing becomes possible, which is, now you can just set this thing to work, trying to figure out how to build AI itself. Is that what I’m hearing you say?

casey newton

Basically. I’d break it down into two stages. So I think the coding is separate from the complete automation, as I previously mentioned. I think that I expect to see systems that are able to do all the coding extremely well, but might lack research taste, for example. They might lack good judgment about what types of experiments to run. And so that’s why they can’t completely automate the research process. And then you have to make a new system or continually train the old system so that it gets that taste. It gets that judgment. Similarly, they might lack coordination ability. They might be not so good at working together in large organizations of thousands of copies, at least initially. But then you fix that. And you come up with new methods. And you do additional training environments and get them good at that sort of thing. And that’s what we depict happening over the first half of 2027. And then we depict it happening in only half a year, because it goes faster, because they’ve got all the coding down pat. And so even though humans are still directing the whole process, they just give orders to the coding agents. And they quickly make everything actually work. And then, halfway through the year, they’ve succeeded in making new training runs that train the skills that the AIs were missing. So now they’re not just coding agents. They are able to do the research taste as well. They’re able to come up with the new ideas. They’re able to come up with hypotheses and test them. And they’re able to work together in big hive-mind clusters of thousands and thousands of them. And that’s when things really kick off. That’s when it really starts to accelerate.

kevin roose

In your scenario, you have this “choose your own adventure” ending, where, after this thing you call the intelligence explosion, where the superhuman AI coders get into AI R&D, and they start automating the process of building better and better AIs, you have two buttons that you can click. And one of them unspools the “good place” ending, where we decide to slow down AI development, and really get these things under control, and solve alignment. And then the red button, you push that, and it goes into this very dark, dystopian scenario, where we lose control of AI. They start deceiving and scheming against us. And ultimately, maybe we all die. Why did you decide to give people the option of choosing one of those two endings, rather than just sketching what you believe to be the most probable outcome?

daniel kokotajlo

So we did start by sketching what we believe to be the most probable outcome. And it’s the race ending, the one that ends with the misaligned AIs in control of everything. So we did that first. And then we were like, well, this is kind of depressing and sad. And there’s a whole bunch of stuff that we didn’t get to talk about because of that. And so we wanted to then have a different ending that ended differently. In fact, we wanted to have a whole spread of different possible outcomes. But we were limited by time and labor. And we were only able to pull together one other outcome, which is the one that we debated in the slowdown ending. So in the slowdown ending, they solve the alignment issues. And they actually get AIs that are actually what they say on their tin. They’re not faking it. They just actually have the goals and values that were put into them or that the company was trying to train into them. It takes them a couple of months to sort that out. That’s why it’s a slowdown. They had to pivot a lot of their compute and energy towards figuring that stuff out. But they succeed. And so then, in that ending, we still have this crazy arms race with China. And we still have this crazy geopolitical crisis. And in fact, it still ends in a similar sort of way, with this massive arms buildup on both sides, this massive integration into the economy, and then ultimately, a peace treaty.

kevin roose

I’m curious, Daniel, if the events of the last week in Washington — the tariffs, this looming trade war with China — have affected your forecast at all.

daniel kokotajlo

I mean, we’ve been iteratively improving it. But the core structure of it was basically done a few months ago. So this is all new to us and wasn’t really part of the forecast. How would it change things? Well, if the trade war continues, and causes a recession, and stuff like that, it might just generally slow the pace of AI progress, but not by much, I think. Like, say it makes compute 30 percent more expensive so that the companies are able to buy 30 percent less of it. Maybe that would translate to a 15 percent reduction in overall research velocity over the next few years, which would mean that the milestones that we talk about happen a few months later instead of when they do. So the story would still be basically the same.

casey newton

So one of the things I think is most interesting about your project is the Bets and Bounties section, where you are going to pay people for finding errors in your work, for convincing you to change your mind on key points, or for drafting some alternate scenarios. So talk to me a little bit about how that became part of this project.

daniel kokotajlo

So I come from the sort of rationalist community background, which is big into making predictions and making bets, putting your money where your mouth is. So I have a sort of aesthetic interest in doing that sort of thing. But then also, specifically, one of the goals of this project is to get people to think more about this stuff and to do more scenario forecasting along the lines of what we’ve done. We’re really hoping that people will counter this with their own reasonably detailed alternative pathways that represents their vision of what’s coming. And so we’re going to give out a few thousand dollars of prizes to try to mildly incentivize that. And then, as for the bounties thing, already, we’ve gotten dozens of people being like, oh, you say this, but isn’t this a typo? Or like, this feels wrong. And so I have a backlog of things to process. But I’m going to get through it. I’m going to pay out the little payments, and fix all the little bugs, and stuff like that. And I’m just quite heart-warmed to see that level of engagement.

casey newton

And have you taken any bets on different scenarios so far?

daniel kokotajlo

I think, so far, I’ve done one or two. But mostly, there’s just a backlog I need to work through.

casey newton

Got it. Got it.

kevin roose

Now, Daniel, you said you’ve been getting some good responses from people at the AI companies to this scenario forecast. I did a bunch of calling around when I was writing about this. And after we spoke, I talked to a bunch of different people, both in the AI research community and outside of it. And I would say the most frequent reaction I got was just kind of disbelief. One person I talked to, a prominent AI researcher, said he thought it was an April Fool’s joke when I first showed him this scenario, because it just sounded so outlandish. You’ve got Chinese espionage, and the models going rogue, and the superhuman coders. And it all just seemed fantastical. And it was almost like they didn’t even think it was worth engaging with because it was so far out. I’m curious if you’ve gotten much of that kind of reaction and what your response is.

daniel kokotajlo

A couple things. So first of all, well, go write your own damn scenario, then. I would say you either will write a scenario that doesn’t seem outlandish, which I will completely tear apart as unrealistic, and just assuming, basically, that AI progress hits a wall, or you’ll write a scenario that does feel very outlandish, but perhaps in different ways than ours do. Again, are they actually going to get to AGI or superintelligence by the end of this decade? If so, you can’t possibly write that in a way that’s not outlandish. It’s just a question of, which outlandish thing are you going to write? And if you think maybe this is not going to happen, and it’s going to hit a wall, yeah, that’s possible too. I think that’s reasonable. I don’t think it’s the most likely outcome. I do actually think that probably, by the end of this decade, we’re going to have superintelligence. But I think it’s — yeah. Yeah.

casey newton

And then say more about that, because I assume that a lot of our listeners think — either truly think that it will hit a wall, or they’re just sort of counting on it hitting a wall, so as not to have to reckon with any of the scenarios that you describe. So what is your message to the person that’s just like, eh, it’ll probably hit a wall?

daniel kokotajlo

I mean, read the literature. Like, there’s —

casey newton

These people are not going to read the literature. They listen to podcasts specifically so they don’t have to read the literature.

daniel kokotajlo

Yeah, fair. Well, I could point to specific parts of the literature, like benchmarks, for example, and the trends on them. So I would say, the benchmarks used to be terrible, but they’re actually becoming a lot better. METR, in particular, has these agentic coding benchmarks, where they actually give AI systems access to some GPUs and say, have fun. You have eight hours to make progress on this research problem. Good luck. And then they measure how good they are compared to human researchers, given the same setup. And line goes up on the graph. It seems like, in a year or two, they’ll have AIs that are able to just autonomously do eight-hour-long ML research tasks on these sorts of things. And that’s not AGI. That’s not superintelligence. But that is maybe the first milestone that I was talking about, superhuman coder. So I point to those sorts of trends. And then separately, I would also just do the appeal to authority. Like, if you’re not going to read the literature, if you’re not going to look at the — if you’re not going to form your own opinion about this, and you’re still just deferring to what other people think, well, then I will say, yeah, there’s a bunch of naysayers out there who are saying this is all never going to happen. It’s just fantasy. But also, there’s a bunch of extremely credible people with amazing track records, both inside the companies and outside the companies, who are, in fact, taking this extremely seriously —

kevin roose

Yeah. I also want to read you —

daniel kokotajlo

— including our scenario. Like, Yoshua Bengio, for example, read an early draft of our thing, and liked it, and gave us some feedback on it. And then we put a quote from him at the top saying, everyone should read this. It’s plausible. So he’s a pioneering AI researcher.

kevin roose

Yeah. Another genre of criticism I’ve heard of this forecast is from people who just don’t — who are just questioning the idea that if you get AIs that are superhuman at coding, they will be able to bootstrap their way to general intelligence. And I just want to read you a quote from an email that I got from David Autor, who is a very well-known economist at MIT. And I had asked him to look at this scenario and sort of react to it, and with a particular eye on, like, what might this be missing as far as how it assumes this easy and fast jump from superhuman coding to something like AGI? And I’ll just read you what he said. He said, “LLMs and their ilk are superpowered incarnations of one incredibly important and powerful part of our cognition. The reason I say we’re not on a glide path to AGI is that simply taking this capability to 11 does not substitute for the parts that are still missing. I think that humanity will get to AGI eventually. I’m not a dualist. I just don’t believe that swimming faster and faster allows you to fly.” What is your reaction to that?

daniel kokotajlo

I agree. We depict this in the course of the story. So if you read AI 2027, they have something that’s like LLMs, but with a lot more reinforcement learning to do long-horizon tasks. And that is what counts as the first superhuman coder. So it’s already somewhat different from the systems of today, but it’s still broadly similar. It’s still maybe the same fundamental architecture, just a lot more training, a lot more scaling up, and in particular, a lot more training specifically on long-horizon agentic coding tasks. But that’s not itself AGI. I agree. That’s just the superhuman coder that you get early on. And then you have to go through several more paradigm shifts to get to actual superintelligence. And we depict that happening over the course of 2027. So a key thing that I think that everyone needs to be thinking about is this takeoff speeds variable. How much faster does the research go when you’ve reached the first milestone? And how much faster does the research go when you reach the second milestone? And so forth. And we are, of course, uncertain about this, like we are about many things. We say in the scenario that we could easily imagine it being five times slower than we depict and taking five years instead of one year. But also, we could imagine it being five times faster than we depict and taking like two months. So we want to do a lot more research on that, obviously. If you want to know where our numbers are coming from, go to the website. There’s a tab that you can click on that lists — has a bunch of back-of-the-envelope calculations and little mini-essays where we generated the quantitative estimates that are the skeleton of the story.

kevin roose

One other piece of criticism I’ve seen of this project that I wanted to ask you about was from a researcher at Anthropic named Saffron Huang, who argued on X that she thought that your approach in AI 2027 was highly counterproductive — basically, that you were in danger of creating a self-fulfilling prophecy by making these sort of scary outcomes very legible, by burying some assumptions, that you were essentially making the bad scenario that you’re worried about more likely to actually happen. What do you make of that?

daniel kokotajlo

I’m quite worried about that as well. And this is something we’ve been fretting about since day one of the project. So let me just say a little bit more about that. So first of all, there is a long history of this sort of thing seeming to happen in the field of artificial general intelligence research, most notably Ilyas Yudkowsky, who is the sort of, I don’t know, Ur-father of worrying about AGI, at least in this generation. Alan Turing also worried about it. But Sam Altman specifically tweeted — you remember this tweet?

kevin roose

Yeah.

daniel kokotajlo

Sam specifically said, hats off to Ilyas Yudkowsky for raising awareness about AGI. It’s happening much faster now because of his doomsaying, because it’s caused a bunch of people to pay more attention to the possibility, and to start investing in these companies, and so forth. So I was sort of, I don’t know, twisting the knife at him, because he obviously doesn’t want this to happen faster. He thinks we need more time to prepare, and make it safe, and so forth. But it does seem like there’s been this effect, where people talking about how powerful and scary AGI could be has maybe caused it to come a little bit faster and caused people to wake up and race harder towards it. And similarly, I’m worried about causing something like that with the AI 2027. One of the subplots in AI 2027 is this whole like concentration of power issue of, who gets to control the army of superintelligences? And in the race ending, it’s sort of a moot question, because the army of superintelligences is just pretending to be controlled. And so it’s not actually listening to anyone when it counts. But in the slowdown ending, they do actually align the AIs. And so they are actually going to do what they’re told. And then who gets to say that? And the answer in our slowdown ending is the oversight committee, which is this ad hoc group of people that is some CEOs and the president, who get together and share power over the army of superintelligences. But what I would like to see is something more democratic than that, something where the power is more distributed. I’m also afraid that it could be less democratic than that. Like, at least we get an oligarchy with this committee. But it could very easily end up a dictatorship, where one person has absolute control over the army of superintelligences. This is yet another example of how I’m trying to not have the self-fulfilling prophecy happen. Like, I don’t want people to read this and be like, hmm, I’m a CEO. [LAUGHS]

casey newton

I can make a lot of money by building misaligned AI.

daniel kokotajlo

Or maybe — yeah. But all that being said —

casey newton

Yeah. So any of our evil villain listeners out there, steepling your fingers in your lair under a mountain, knock it off.

daniel kokotajlo

Yeah. So all that being said, we are taking a gamble that sunlight is the best disinfectant. Like, the best way forward is to just generally tell the world about what we think is coming and hope that even though many people will react to that in exactly the wrong ways, enough people will react to that in the right ways that overall, it will be good, because I am tired of the alternative of, like, hush-hush, keep everything secret, do backroom negotiations, and hope that we get the right people in the right rooms at the right time, and that they make the right decisions. I think that is doomed. So I’m placing my faith in humanity, and telling it as I see it, and hoping that insofar as I’m correct, people will wake up in time, and overall, that the outcome will be better.

kevin roose

Yeah. All right.

casey newton

Thank you, Daniel.

kevin roose

Thanks, Daniel.

daniel kokotajlo

Thank you so much.

casey newton

When we come back, Meta decides to fake it till they make it.

kevin roose

We’ll talk about the cheating scandal that is rocking the world of AI benchmarks. [MUSIC PLAYING] Well, Casey, there’s one other big AI story we want to talk about this week. And that is about the drama surrounding Llama.

casey newton

That’s right, Kevin. Meta has a new large language model. It was hotly anticipated. But I think it’s fair to say, it kind of stumbled out of the gate.

kevin roose

Yeah, they had some Llama Llama cred drama.

casey newton

How many times are you going to do the Llama-drama pun?

kevin roose

Well, there’s a very popular children’s book called “Llama Llama Red Pajama.” Are you aware of this?

casey newton

I am.

kevin roose

So let’s get into it. There has been a lot of things going on around this new language model, Llama 4, that Meta released last weekend. Casey, you’ve been writing about this in your newsletter this week. Catch me up. What is going on with Llama 4?

casey newton

Yeah, so look. Meta has invested billions and billions of dollars in AI. And they’re taking a very different approach from the AI labs that we most often talk about on this show. Companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, their models are closed. You can’t download, fine-tune, re-release them under a very permissive license. But with Meta’s, you can. And when Llama 3 came out last year, developers said, oh, this thing is actually pretty good. It’s not as good as the state of the art, which is often true of the open models. But it’s getting up there.

kevin roose

Right. And so they spent all this money to develop Llama 4. People have been talking for months about how this was going to blow all the other open weights models out of the water. And then they release it. And what happens?

casey newton

Well, two things happen, Kevin. The first is that Meta trumpets this model in the way that companies usually do trumpet their most recent models, as being the most powerful ever, the most efficient. They show off a bunch of benchmarks. They say, this thing is highly capable. And it’s the bee’s knees. They didn’t actually say it was the bee’s knees. I’m not sure anyone has said that in the past 70 years. But they said things like that. And one of the benchmarks that really got people’s attention was LM Arena. You know LM Arena?

kevin roose

I know of it, but I haven’t spent much time on it. What is it?

casey newton

So it’s this really interesting project. It is a very small nonprofit that includes some researchers from UC Berkeley. And what they do is they get people to volunteer to help. And they’ll have people enter a query. And then they’ll show them the response from two different chatbots that are not labeled. And after they get the answer, the user will say, oh, I liked this one better. And they collect those votes over time. And the more that people vote for one chatbot over another, the higher it rises on LM Arena.

kevin roose

I see. So it’s sort of like a crowdsourced leaderboard for which of these models people prefer.

casey newton

Exactly. And Kevin, you know as well as anyone else that whenever a new model comes out, the question of, How good is it? turns out to be weirdly hard to answer.

kevin roose

Yeah, right.

casey newton

Maybe it’s really good for what you need it to do. Maybe it’s really bad. Or maybe it’s about as good as something else, but you just happen to like it better because it has a style that matches with what you’re looking for. So in such a world, companies are desperate to be seen as good. But they don’t have an easy way of communicating that. And that’s when LM Arena enters the picture, because if you can get high enough on that leaderboard, you can point to it and say, aha! Look at how we’re doing.

kevin roose

Right. The people have voted.

casey newton

That’s right. The people have spoken. And look how well we’re doing. So do you know how well Llama 4 does on LM Arena?

kevin roose

No.

casey newton

Llama 4 comes in at number 2, just under Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental, which is the latest model from Google, which has been through a lot of testing, and which, basically, there’s universal acclaim for this model. People think this is a truly great model, not just at this little chatbot contest, but across a bunch of other things, including coding and a lot of other things.

kevin roose

So Llama 4 immediately zooming up to number 2 on LM Arena would seem to indicate that Meta has really cooked here. They have built this incredible model. They are releasing it to the public under an open weight structure. And they are one of the leading AI labs when it comes to creating very powerful models.

casey newton

That’s right, except there’s an asterisk.

kevin roose

Oh, boy.

casey newton

This version of Llama 4 is an experimental model. Meta, on its website, says it has been optimized for chat. People start to look into this. They noticed this is not the version of Llama 4 that is actually available for download.

kevin roose

The one that was included in LM Arena was not the one that people could download?

casey newton

That’s right. It had a different name. It was named Maverick O326 Experimental. And people start to think, oh, wait a minute. What if what happened here isn’t what normally happens on LM Arena, which is, people make a new model, and submit it to LM Arena, and see how it does? What if Meta trained a special version of Llama 4 just to be good at LM Arena?

kevin roose

Hmm.

casey newton

Now, I have spent the past week trying to research whether this is true. And on Monday I got Meta to send me a statement, which I guess I should read. “We experiment with all types of custom variants. And this experimental version is,” quote, “a chat-optimized version we experimented with that also performs well on LM Arena. We have now released our final open-source version, and we will see how developers customize Llama 4 for their own use cases.” So this was really interesting to me, because when they say, well, it also performs well on LM Arena, it suggests that, well, maybe they just made, like, I don’t know, 15 of these models. And they were just like, oh, look. This one happens to do well on LM arena. That is one possibility. I think another possibility is exactly what the cynics think, which is, oh, no. They reverse engineered how LM Arena works. And they built a bot that was just going to beat it.

kevin roose

And how would you do that? Like, if your goal was to create a model that would perform very well on this one specific leaderboard, what would you do?

casey newton

So LM Arena has released a lot of chats over the years that show which chats are considered preferable to other chats. And it seems that the users of LM Arena really like it when the bot has a high degree of what they call sycophancy. So basically, you’re just like, what should I have for breakfast today? And the chatbot is like, oh my god. That’s such a great question. You’re a genius. I love the way you’re starting the day off right. That is the correct answer that people pick. And so you can build a chatbot that essentially just flatters people constantly. And it tends to do really well on Chatbot Arena. So anyways, in the aftermath of this confusion, LM Arena, which is a very mild-mannered organization that I think is not used to being involved in public controversies, puts out a statement. And I have to read the statement, Kevin, because, as gentle as it is, I found it pretty damning. They don’t go so far as to say Meta cheated. But what they do say is, quote, “Meta’s interpretation of our policy did not match what we expect from model providers. Meta should have made it clear that this experimental model was a customized model to optimize for human preference. As a result of that, we are updating our leaderboard policies to reinforce our commitment to fair, reproducible evaluations so this confusion doesn’t occur in the future.” So why is that statement so interesting to me? Well, you basically just have this tiny group of researchers over at Berkeley. And Meta violates their policies so hard that they have to change the rules for how this competition even works, just to get people to stop breaking the competition.

kevin roose

Yeah. I thought this was a really interesting set of stories. I’m still waiting for someone, ideally you, to get to the bottom of what actually happened inside Meta. But I think it’s worth talking about for two reasons — one, because I think it says something about Meta and its place in the AI race, and the other, because I think it says something about the state of AI, and these benchmarks, and how useful they are or aren’t in making sense of the torrent of new models that are coming out constantly from the big AI labs. So maybe let’s take those one by one. What do you think this says about Meta’s place in the AI race, if it does turn out that they had sort of gamed this leaderboard to make it look like their model was better than it was?

casey newton

Here’s what I think. I think, if you’re winning the AI race, you do not waste time trying to beat LM Arena. What you do is what Google did, which is just release a very powerful Pro version of Gemini. And it just happens to float to the top of the arena, not because it’s been optimized for conversation, but just because it’s a great model that’s really good at a lot of things. If you have to make a custom version of your model just to win this rinky-dink competition, it’s hard for me to think of a more adverse indicator for the quality of Meta’s AI program. And we should say, there’s been reporting in the information over the past year that the Llama 4 development process has been really frustrating for Meta, that they delayed the release twice because they weren’t getting the results that they wanted. And when it finally did come out, and people started to put it through other evaluations, they found that it just was not hitting the mark. In fact, Kevin, Ethan Mollick, former guest on “Hard Fork,” compared the versions of the experimental chat that was winning the leaderboard to the chats that were produced by the final open-weights model. And what he found was the open-weights model was producing really bad responses — essentially, that the optimized model was performing so much better than the real one that it wasn’t even close.

kevin roose

So why don’t they just release the optimized model, then?

casey newton

That’s a great question. I don’t know the answer to that. But what I’m going to assume is that whatever fine-tuning is necessary to increase the level of sycophancy in the bot might be great for this sort of competition, but maybe it’s really bad for coding, or creative writing, or the countless other things that we now expect LLMs to be good at, right? Fine-tuning is a very powerful process that can take a very general purpose model that’s kind of mediocre at a bunch of things and make it really good at one thing. But these days, people have a lot of options to choose from with their large language models. And there are a lot of them that just have very high general capability. So they’re going to use those instead.

kevin roose

Yeah. I mean, I have not done my own reporting on the situation inside Meta with Llama 4. But I will just say, from a broad view, if you just step back from this particular scandal, Meta is not one of the top three AI labs in America when it comes to releasing frontier models. They are not in the top tier of frontier AI research. A lot of their key researchers have left the company. Their models are not seen as as capable as the models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind. And I think that really frustrates them. I think Mark Zuckerberg and his lieutenants, they really want to be seen as part of the vanguard here. And so I would not be surprised at all if, in an effort to juice their numbers and appear to be leapfrogging some of their competition, they may have violated the terms of one particular AI benchmark. And that should make us question how well their overall AI program is doing.

casey newton

Absolutely. And by the way, the next time they release a model and come out with a bunch of wild claims, you think I’m going to believe any of that?

kevin roose

Totally.

casey newton

No. It’s like, you’re going to have to go, try to verify every single claim they make independently. And look. I assume some people are going to hear this and think that I’m making a mountain out of a molehill. But I just think about what Daniel Kokotajlo just told us, about how powerful these systems are becoming and about how powerful they’re about to become. And you want them to be sort of loyal to human beings, but you also want them to not be used for bad behavior. And if there is a company out there that is just cheating to win benchmarks, what else can that model do? So even though this may seem like a small thing, I think it matters that we have companies building AI systems where we have some level of trust in those companies, where we believe they have some amount of integrity when it comes to how they operate. And so this was a moment where I thought, wow, my trust in Meta as an AI company has just been dramatically reduced.

kevin roose

Yeah. So the Meta of it all aside, I think this does actually raise a really important question about the broader AI industry, which is the value of benchmarks in general, because one thing that I’ve heard from AI researchers over the past year or two is that these benchmarks, these tests that are given to these models to figure out how intelligent they are, they all have some flaw built into them. There’s this issue of data contamination, which is, what if some of the answers on these tests are being fed into these models during their training process so that you’re really not getting a sense of how capable the model is? They’re just kind of regurgitating these answers that they’ve seen already. That is an issue. There are also just the issue that all of these companies are effectively grading their own homework, right? There’s no federal program that sort of puts these things through their paces and releases standardized benchmark scores that we can actually verify and trust. Some of these AI companies are using different methods to even apply these benchmark tests. There’s these things called consensus@64 and all these different ways that you can cherry pick the best answer that your model gives, if you give it the test a bunch of times, and use that for your score. So I think we are just losing our ability to trust the way that we measure these AI models in general.

casey newton

Yeah. And it’s so frustrating. I was thinking, Kevin. Imagine in the early 2010s, and it’s not just that Instagram comes out as an app in the App Store. You have Instagram. You have Instagram o1. You have Instagram o1 Mini. You have Instagram o1 DeepResearch. And it’s like, download the one that’s best for you. You’d be like, why are you making me do any of this? Just give me the one thing that works. And while every AI lab is trying to realize that, in the meantime, we’re living through this Cambrian explosion of large language models. And on one hand, I think that makes it really important for there to be benchmarks, so that we can look at a glance to have a basic sense of, is this thing even worth my time? But on the other hand, that makes the benchmarks such an attractive target for gaming and outright cheating. And so that’s why the researcher Andre Karpathy has said that we have what he calls an evaluation crisis, where, when a new model comes out, the question of, How good is it? is just very difficult to answer. I’ve been wondering what we can do as journalists to try to answer those questions better. Like, is this a place for journalists to actually say, OK, new model came out. We’re going to have our own custom set of evaluations. Maybe we’re going to keep those private in some way to prevent them from being gamed. But what solutions do you see here to this crisis?

kevin roose

Well, at the risk of scooping myself here, I will disclose that I am actually starting to work on my own benchmark, because I think that part of how we are going to make sense of these AI models is that people will just start developing their own set of tests to give to new models, not necessarily to determine their overall intelligence, but to determine how good they are at the things we care about. Personally, I don’t care much if an AI model is getting a 97 percent on the graduate-level physics exam or a 93 percent. That does not make a huge difference in my life.

casey newton

Because it’s still higher than you’re going to get.

kevin roose

Exactly. And I am not a graduate-level physics researcher. So I might care more about whether a model is good at creative writing or not. And I might want a battery of tests to determine that. And so I think that as these things become more critical in people’s lives and work, we will start seeing these more personalized tests and evaluations that actually measure if the models are good at the things that we care about. What do you think?

casey newton

Yeah. I think that’s a great point. And after you told me that you were going to do this, I sort of started a scheme and thought, I want my own benchmarks too, because there are — I don’t know. I’m sure I can come up with a list of like 10 things that I wish AI could do for me today that it still can’t. And so maybe it’s time that I should start scenario planning.

kevin roose

What’s one of your tests that you want to give AI models to determine if they’re capable or not?

casey newton

Well, for example, I have a newsletter that has customer service issues. People email us. They say, oh my gosh, can I change my email address?

kevin roose

They’ll say, the writing in this is so bad.

casey newton

No, people love the writing. That’s all I hear about, the writing. People are saying, this — are humans writing this? That’s insane. But I would love to be able to automate some of that, make it easier for people. Oh, you need to download your invoice? Which is a question we get a lot. It’s like, OK, yes. Actually, we’re just going to handle that in an automated way. So that’s just one very easy thing. And if you’re thinking, oh, Casey, I actually have a product that can already do that for you, please don’t email me. It can’t. I’ve been through this.

kevin roose

Can I tell you one of the things that I want to test AI on?

casey newton

Yeah.

kevin roose

So, as you know, I just moved into a new house. And so, as a result, I have spent between a third and a half of my waking hours over the last few weeks thinking about hanging pictures. Hanging pictures is one of my least favorite tasks in the world.

casey newton

I hate it.

kevin roose

You have to do math. You have to bring out the laser level. I mean, it’s a huge process.

casey newton

The golden ratio.

kevin roose

Yes. And I would love for an AI system to be able to hang pictures for me.

casey newton

That’s beautiful.

kevin roose

And as soon as that happens, to me, that’s AGI.

casey newton

Now, would that involve a robot?

kevin roose

Probably. Yeah. So we got to make some progress before we get there. But if you’re listening to this, and you’re working at one of these robotics companies, get on it. [THEME MUSIC]

What’s Wrong With Apple?,"Even before President Trump’s tariffs threatened to upend Apple’s manufacturing business in China, the company’s struggle to make new products was leading some people inside its lavish Silicon Valley headquarters to wonder whether the company had somehow lost its magic.

The tariffs, which were introduced April 2, caused Apple to lose $773 billion in market capitalization in four days and briefly lose its standing as the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. But investors had already started to sour on the company, sending its share price down 8 percent in the first four months of the year, double the S&P 500’s decline.

Apple had hoped to revive its fortunes over the past year with a virtual reality headset, the Vision Pro, and an artificial intelligence system called Apple Intelligence. Sales of the headset have been a disappointment, however, and the signature features of the A.I. system have been postponed because it didn’t work as well as the company had expected.

The company’s issues underscored how its reputation for innovation, once considered a fundamental element of its brand, has become an albatross, fueling angst among employees and frustration among customers. And company insiders worry that Apple, despite its years of gravity-defying profits, is hamstrung by the political infighting, penny pinching and talent drain that often bedevil large companies, according to more than a dozen former and current employees and advisers.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/technology/apple-issues-trump-tariffs.html,1
"How TikTok’s Parent, ByteDance, Became an A.I. Powerhouse","The Chinese internet giant ByteDance has made some of the world’s most popular apps: TikTok and, in China, Douyin and Toutiao.

In the United States, TikTok claims 170 million users. But in China, about 700 million use the domestic version, Douyin, and 300 million scroll the headlines on Toutiao, a news app. Every video that ByteDance’s users watch or post gives the company another data point about how people use the internet. For years, ByteDance has applied that wealth of information to make its apps more appealing, improving its ability to recommend content to keep users hooked.

ByteDance is also using the data as the linchpin of a growing business in artificial intelligence. The company has invested billions of dollars in the infrastructure needed to power A.I. systems, building vast data centers in China and Southeast Asia and buying up advanced semiconductors. ByteDance is also on an A.I. hiring spree.

ByteDance is best known outside China for TikTok, an app so popular that at least 20 governments have adopted partial bans over concerns about its influence on national security and public opinion.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/business/tiktok-china-bytedance-ai.html,1
"Neutrinos Are Shrinking, and That’s a Good Thing for Physics","Physicists know a few things about neutrinos. They are prolific across the cosmos, created virtually anytime atomic nuclei snap together or rip apart. But they carry no electric charge and are notoriously difficult to detect.

Neutrinos also come in three types, which physicists describe as flavors. And, oddly, they morph from one flavor to another as they move through space and time, a discovery recognized by the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2015. The underlying mechanism that makes these transformations possible, physicists realized, meant that neutrinos must have some mass.

But only just so. Neutrinos are mindboggingly light, and physicists don’t know why.

Uncovering the exact values of the mass of neutrinos could lead to “some kind of portal” to new physics, said Alexey Lokhov, a scientist at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany. “This is, for now, the world’s best limit,” he said of his team’s measurement.

Dr. Lokhov and his colleagues used the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino, or KATRIN, experiment to narrow down the mass of a neutrino. At one end of the 230-foot-long apparatus was a source of tritium, a heavier version of hydrogen with two neutrons in its nucleus. Because tritium is unstable, it decays into helium: One neutron converts into a proton, which spits out an electron in the process. It also spits out an antineutrino, the antimatter twin of a neutrino. The two should have identical mass.

The mass of the original tritium is split among the products of the decay: the helium, electron and antineutrino. Neither neutrinos nor antineutrinos can be directly detected, but a sensor at the other end of the experiment recorded 36 million electrons, over 259 days, shed by the decaying tritium. By measuring the energy of the electron’s motion, they could indirectly deduce the maximum mass possible for the antineutrino.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/science/neutrinos-mass-physics.html,1
Nintendo Switch Game Console Release Is Whipsawed by Tariff Threats,"For months, Nintendo, the maker of famed video game series like Super Mario Bros. and Donkey Kong, had expected the morning of April 2 to be a celebration.

To much fanfare, the company announced the price and release date for the Switch 2, its new video game console eight years in the making. At an event in New York City, Doug Bowser, Nintendo of America’s president, took the stage as fans cheered the arrival of new games to accompany the console; Mario Kart, Donkey Kong and Kirby among them.

Then, later that same day, President Trump announced tariffs that sent global stock markets reeling and put the Mario party in jeopardy. The new Switch was made in Vietnam, one of the countries on the tariff list.

Two days later, Nintendo said it was delaying pre-orders for the Switch 2 and possibly raising the price from $450. Just how high was unclear. But on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he was delaying expanded tariffs on Vietnam and many other countries for 90 days. Nintendo has yet to say how the delay will affect the Switch 2’s price.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/technology/nintendo-switch-tariffs-trump.html,1
Cheaper iPhones and Pixels Are Here. They Are Pretty Good.,"With all the talk about tariffs driving up costs, the word “cheaper” should bring comfort to just about anyone. That’s why I’m delighted to share that the cheaper smartphone from Google has arrived, a few months after Apple released a somewhat cheaper entry-level iPhone — and that both products are very good.

Google this week released the Pixel 9a, the $500 sibling of its $800 flagship smartphone, the Pixel 9. It competes directly with the $600 iPhone 16e released in February, the cheaper version of Apple’s $800 iPhone 16.

Both of the new phones have the staples that people care most about — great cameras, nice screens, zippy speeds, modern software and long battery life. To cut costs, they omit some fancier extras, like advanced camera features.

Is it a wise idea to save some bucks, or better to spend more on the fancier phones? To find out, I strapped on a fanny pack and carried all four phones with me for the last week to run tests.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/technology/personaltech/iphone-16e-pixel-9a-cheaper-phone-models.html,1
OpenAI Asks Court to Bar Elon Musk From Unfairly Attacking It,"OpenAI asked a federal court on Wednesday to bar Elon Musk from unfairly attacking it through a high-profile lawsuit he filed last year, the latest move in a bitter feud between the artificial intelligence start-up and the world’s richest man.

In a filing in federal court in San Francisco, OpenAI said Mr. Musk had “made it his project to take down OpenAI.” The company requested that the tech billionaire be stopped from taking “further unlawful and unfair action” against OpenAI and asked the court to hold Mr. Musk responsible for any damage he has caused the firm.

The filing was another sign of the acrimony between Mr. Musk, who was a founder of OpenAI, and the company over the direction of the fast-evolving technology. In August, Mr. Musk sued OpenAI and two of its founders, Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, claiming they were putting the commercial interests of the company and A.I. ahead of the public good with the technology.

In a statement, OpenAI said: “Elon continues to use bad-faith tactics in an attempt to slow down OpenAI for his personal benefit. These efforts are anti-competitive and go against our mission, which is why today we filed a countersuit to stop them.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/technology/openai-elon-musk-lawsuit.html,1
Launch of First Amazon Project Kuiper Internet Satellites Is Scrubbed,"The battle of billionaires in space between Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk is ready to enter a new arena: satellite internet. But the contest will have to wait another day as weather along Florida’s Space Coast on Wednesday night interfered with a launch attempt.

Amazon, the company that Mr. Bezos started as an online bookseller three decades ago, is now a merchandising behemoth, the owner of the James Bond franchise, a seller of electronic gadgets like Echo smart speakers and one of the most powerful providers of cloud computing.

So perhaps it is not a surprise that Amazon is now launching the first few of thousands of satellites known as Project Kuiper to provide another option for remaining connected in the modern world. The market for beaming high-speed internet to the ground from orbit is currently dominated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX rocket company, which operates a similar service, Starlink. Starlink, with thousands of satellites in orbit and more launching nearly every week, already serves several million customers around the world.

Why was the launch postponed?

The first 27 Project Kuiper satellites were scheduled to lift off on Wednesday between 7 and 9 p.m. Eastern time from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. They were to fly on an Atlas V, a rocket made by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin.

Mr. Wallace deleted his posts about Ms. Ellis after her Facebook video started spreading online. He posted an “important update” on the afternoon of Jan. 31, writing that Ms. Ellis “was not piloting the helicopter that crashed in to the plane and is still alive.”

The filing claims that Mr. Wallace “concocted a destructive and irresponsible defamation campaign.” It was filed in U.S. District Court in Colorado, the state where Ms. Ellis’s lawyers said Mr. Wallace resides, and seeks monetary damages to be determined at trial.

Mr. Wallace did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

It is difficult for people who are targeted by digital misinformation to find recourse after lies spread about them online. Social media companies have softened their stance on content moderation in recent years, just as misinformation peddlers have become more prominent and closer to centers of power.

At the same time, the idea that social media influencers could be held personally and financially liable through defamation law for spreading overtly false statements online has grown as one potential avenue for combating misinformation.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/technology/pilot-lawsuit-jo-ellis-matt-wallace.html,1

McChesney, an influential left-leaning media critic who argued that corporate ownership was bad for American journalism and that Silicon Valley billionaires who dominated online information were a threat to democracy, died on March 25 at his home in Madison, Wis. He was 72.

The cause was glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer, his wife, Inger Stole, said.

Professor McChesney was grounded both in academia — he had a Ph.D. in communications and taught at universities — and in ink-on-paper journalism: He was the founding publisher of The Rocket, a Seattle music magazine that reviewed Nirvana’s first single.

His primary thesis, expressed in more than a dozen books and in scores of articles and interviews, was that corporate-owned news media was overly compliant with the political powers that be, and that it restricted the views Americans were exposed to. He further argued that the promise of the internet — of a Wild West market of opinions — had been throttled by a few giant owners of online platforms.

An early book, “Rich Media, Poor Democracy” (1999), warned that consolidation in journalism would undermine democratic norms.

Editor's note: This story contains graphic images of violence and death.

Sudan's catastrophic civil war is grinding into a third year. A conflict that continues to shatter a country that much of the international community still struggles to pay attention to.

Tens of thousands have been killed since The Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group started fighting in the capital Khartoum in April 2023. The two military factions had seized power from a transitional civilian government in 2021. Then they turned on each other two years later, with devastating consequences.

The facts are well documented. Sudan faces the worst humanitarian crisis in the world with hundreds of thousands suffering from famine according to the United Nations. The country faces the world's largest displacement crisis — over 15 million people have been forced to flee their homes.

Both sides have been accused of atrocities, with the RSF — accused of genocide. The U.S. State Department said the RSF had ""systematically murdered men and boys—even infants—on an ethnic basis, and deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence.""

The worst of that genocidal violence is in the western Darfur region. Over the last few days the violence has spiraled. More than 300 people, have been killed in two major displacement camps near El-Fasher city in the western Darfur region, as the RSF launches a major assault on the last state capital in Darfur under the control of the Sudanese army.

Two years on and the Sudanese army has managed to wrest back control of the capital Khartoum. Once a charming and vibrant city at the confluence of the banks of the White and Blue Niles, it is now a shadow of its former self. Health services have collapsed, the capitals airport and many major landmarks destroyed, the national museum systematically looted. Much of the city is rubble.

Despite the unprecedented impact of the war there has been little concerted international action to address it. International donors have so far only committed a fraction of the money called for by the U.N. for Sudan.

On Tuesday, as the war moved into its third year, foreign ministers from 20 countries in met in London in an effort to restart stalled peace talks. The conference, co-hosted by the U.K., France and Germany, took place without the main protagonists - the Sudanese army and the RSF.

In his opening remarks the conference host, the U.K.'s Foreign Secretary David Lammy said, ""Many have given up on Sudan. That is wrong.... We simply cannot look away."" But so far, it seems that the world has.

LONDON — Foreign ministers from 20 countries are meeting in London Tuesday as part of a diplomatic effort to restart stalled peace talks over Sudan's civil war that began two years ago. The United Nations says the conflict has prompted the world's worst humanitarian crisis, and the most devastating famine in decades.

Despite the war's unprecedented impact, with as many as 150,000 people dead, and almost a third of the country's pre-war population displaced, there has been little concerted international action to address the crisis.

The U.K., France and Germany are cohosting Wednesday's conference, but have not invited either of the warring factions themselves; the Sudanese Armed Forces — widely considered to be the de-facto government — and its erstwhile paramilitary partners, known as the Rapid Support Forces — or RSF.

Both forces cooperated to launch a coup against the country's fledgling civilian-led government in 2021 . Civilian rule had emerged after the fall of longtime autocrat, Omar al-Bashir , who was deposed during a 2019 revolution that stunned the region. Sudan's Armed Forces had become the senior partner in a new transitional government, before tensions between the Armed Forces and the RSF ignited a full-blown war in April 2023.

Sudanese officials have expressed anger they were not invited to the talks, as well as frustration at the inclusion of countries that many consider responsible for fanning and fueling the conflict. There is mounting evidence, for instance, that the United Arab Emirates have been arming the Rapid Support Forces, which stand accused of perpetrating genocidal acts against African ethnic groups in Darfur. The RSF has also been accused of carrying out other atrocities during the war, including the systematic use of sexual violence, the targeting of medical facilities, and persistent looting in communities that have fallen under their control.

Last week Sudan's military led government initiated a case against the UAE at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), in which it accused the Arab nation of being complicit in a genocide against African ethnic groups, perpetrated by the RSF and several allied Arab militias.

While rights groups have accused both sides of war crimes, including extrajudicial killings and the blocking of humanitarian aid, they have blamed the vast majority of atrocities on the RSF. The U.S. , U.N. and several rights groups have meanwhile also said the RSF committed acts of genocide during the war, largely against groups of ethnic Masalits, Zagawas and Furs in Darfur. The last genocide in Darfur took place more than 20 years ago, and was carried out by a militia group called the ""Janjaweed,"" that became globally infamous. Members of the group have, in part, evolved to become the RSF.

Last month the Sudanese army regained control of the capital city Khartoum from the RSF. But while the gradual reconstruction of that shattered city begins, the fighting in the west of the country has intensified.

toggle caption AFP via Getty Images/AFP

Over the past week, the RSF intensified its months-long siege on the city of El Fasher in the Western region of Darfur. It is the last Darfuri city that the group does not yet control. The attacks have caused international outrage, with more than 320 people already killed, according to a local grassroots support network called Emergency Response Rooms.

The group said most of those deaths occurred inside two aid camps. One of them, called Zamzam, is the largest displacement camp in Sudan and had hosted more than half a million people, with a famine inside the camp declared last year. The U.N. recently said between 60,000 to 80,000 households in the camp had been displaced by the recent fighting and had fled into the center of El Fasher, or the surrounding desert.

A resident from El Fasher, who asked not to be named, told NPR the situation was ""extremely difficult,"" and said hundreds of thousands of those displaced from the Zamzam camp were now crammed into the city's streets. ""Right now, even in my own house there are more than 100 women and children,"" said the resident, adding that those still out on the streets are surviving ""without water, without food, without health services — and unfortunately no one is asking about them, no one is taking care of them.""

Sponsor Message

""The situation is very bad, it's suffering,"" the resident said. ""Not just suffering, torture.""

Most of Zamzam's residents had sought refuge in the camp during the last major conflict to wrack Darfur back in 2003, having been driven from their homes by the Janjaweed militia group.

toggle caption AFP via Getty Images/AFP

Satellite footage analyzed by the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab showed evidence of the RSF's attack on the Zamzam. Images indicated that more than 200 armed pick-up trucks, known as ""technicals"" had swarmed the camp between April 11 and April 14, and the camp's main market had been torched to the ground during that period.

"" At this point, the RSF has faced no significant consequences for mass atrocities, tantamount to genocide,"" said Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of that Yale research team. ""If they are left alone without any international interdiction, they will be fundamentally in position to complete the slaughter of non-Arab black African civilians from the Zagawa, the Fur and the Masalit, who have sought shelter for 20 years in El Fasher and Zamzam.""

On Sunday an RSF spokesperson, Al Fatih Qurashi, said the RSF had taken over the camp, and said it had harbored fighters aligned with the Sudanese Armed Forces. Widespread reports by local rights groups detailed some of the worst atrocities perpetrated during the current war had occurred inside the camp. These included the rounding up and executing of refugees, as well as aid workers from an aid group called Relief International.

The paramilitary group denied killing any civilians, but Relief International, which operated the only remaining medical facility in the camp, said members of the RSF had executed its workers.

""It was, in our opinion, a brutal and deliberate assault on health facilities,"" said Mart Atterton, regional director for Africa at Relief International. ""Very sadly, nine of our humanitarian colleagues — these are dedicated doctors, ambulance referral drivers and our area team leader — were executed while carrying out life saving work for some of the most vulnerable people in Sudan.""

How Trump's cuts to U.S. foreign aid are imperiling Syria's war crimes investigations,"How Trump's cuts to U.S. foreign aid are imperiling Syria's war crimes investigations

DAMASCUS, Syria — Omar Halaby hobbles through the ruins of his old neighborhood on one leg, with a crutch.

A freckled former teen fighter, Halaby lost his right leg in a 2017 air and artillery attack by Syrian forces loyal to then-President Bashar al-Assad. With Assad's ouster in December, Halaby, now 29, returned to his neighborhood of Jobar, on the edge of Damascus, to watch a backhoe unearth the remains of at least eight of his comrades from a mass grave.

""The regime has fallen, and I need to transition to civilian life,"" Halaby says. ""Part of that process is seeing my late friends one last time, to give them a dignified reburial.""

Sponsor Message

Jobar elders first called the White Helmets, wartime Nobel Peace Prize nominees who are Syria's most skilled first responders. But the group is overstretched, having lost its U.S. funding, and its dispatcher told Jobar residents they would have to get on a waitlist for help excavating mass graves.

So, with Halaby and others watching, neighbors decide to do it themselves — with a backhoe provided by a local civil engineer.

toggle caption Lauren Frayer/NPR

But an argument breaks out between the medical examiner, paramedics from the Syrian Red Crescent and municipal officials about what procedures need to be followed. Unexploded ordnance litters the area, some neighbors warn. The backhoe remains unused.

Syria's longtime dictator is gone. A nearly 14-year civil war is over. But more than 130,000 people remain missing. And the fledgling new state needs help clearing mines, unearthing mass graves and collecting evidence for war crimes investigations.

Jobar's stalled effort reflects some of the larger obstacles facing Syria as it tries to uncover and seek justice for past atrocities, even as support is being cut.

""This is only the start of transitional justice in Syria, and the job is enormous,"" says Stephen Rapp, former U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes, who visited Syria in February. ""Syria needs reliable partners to obtain DNA samples from survivors through swabs of saliva, then begin this long process of excavating mass graves.""

But many of the groups with expertise in these things rely on funding from the United States — and, like the White Helmets, have recently lost it. They're asking the Trump administration not to renew a 90-day pause on foreign aid, which expires this month.

Cuts to U.S. aid hurt White Helmets

toggle caption Hasan Belal for NPR

Vilified by Assad as terrorists, the White Helmets — a nonprofit volunteer first responder group named for the color of their headgear — used to operate only in rebel-held areas. There, throughout the Syrian civil war, they were celebrated for running into danger to aid civilians. A 2016 documentary about them won an Oscar.

Within days of Assad's Dec. 8 ouster, they entered the Syrian capital and set up new headquarters in a central Damascus fire station. Their founder Raed Saleh has since been named to Syria's Cabinet. And his roughly 3,300-member team is struggling to extend its services to the entire country, becoming Syria's main civil defense force.

""Most of Syria is destroyed, and our teams are overstretched everywhere,"" says Farouq Habib, the group's deputy. ""We have documented more than 50 mass graves, and we need resources.""

But just as their mission is expanding, their biggest contributor up to now — the U.S. Agency for International Development — has pulled funding. When the Trump administration dismantled USAID, calling it rife with waste and fraud, the White Helmets lost a $30 million contract — more than half of which was already spent. The group has an annual budget of about $50 million.

""This hinders our survival,"" Habib says, sighing.

The White Helmets still have two forensics teams supported by a much smaller U.S. State Department grant worth about $2.5 million, he notes. That funding was cut, then reinstated, this year.

Despite the Trump administration's cuts, private U.S. citizens are generous and the group is deeply appreciative, Habib says. Almost one-third of the group's global donations come from Americans, he says. The rest of the White Helmets' funding comes from foreign aid donations from other governments and individuals including in Britain, Germany, Denmark and Canada, Habib says.

The process of gathering evidence for possible war crimes trials has slowed

When Assad fell, the doors of Syria's prisons and government offices swung open. Government archives were looted; documents littered the streets. Human rights investigators rushed to collect those documents and preserve them as evidence for possible future trials. But they need help sorting through what they have.

Sponsor Message

""We have thousands and thousands of documents, with lots of details that could help families reveal the fate of their loved ones,"" says Fadel Abdulghany, executive director of the Syrian Network for Human Rights. ""Because those documents often contain the names of those who were arrested [under Assad], the date of when they were killed or moved to a grave — and even the names of the perpetrators as well.""

Abdulghany budgeted to hire a new researcher this year, dedicated to those documents. After operating from the United Kingdom and Qatar during Syria's civil war, he'd also been looking forward to opening a new office in Damascus.

But his organization's USAID funding was cut too, hindering both of those things.

""All of our activities have been limited, including testimonies we've been taking from people released from Assad's prisons,"" Abdulghany says. ""The U.S. used to be a reliable partner. But the mentality of how U.S. soft power is used around the world is changing.""

It's not just Syria. The Trump administration has cut aid that funded schools, vaccination programs, medication and medical equipment, media organizations and literacy programs around the world. Trump has said he wants overseas spending to more closely align with his foreign policy goals and ""America First"" approach.

Syrian survivors say their pain is prolonged

Majida Kaddo, 60, stands at night in a Damascus traffic circle with a candle, shoulder to shoulder with other survivors, receiving condolences from passersby and friends.

Kaddo has five relatives who disappeared into Assad's prisons during the civil war. None was ever charged with a crime. Only one of their bodies was found.

On Dec. 8, when Assad fled, she rushed — along with thousands of other Syrians — to Damascus' notorious Sednaya prison, searching for her relatives' faces in the crowds of freed prisoners stumbling out. They never emerged.

Kaddo hopes human rights investigators combing through evidence might eventually find answers for her family. But she's devastated by news their work has been hobbled by U.S. aid cuts.

""There's nothing worse than being so close to justice, after 14 years of war,"" she says. ""And then to have your pain prolonged.""

The Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, may have taken sensitive data from the National Labor Relations Board and hid its tracks, according to a whistleblower disclosure obtained by NPR. DOGE has aggressively sought access to government data and computer systems since the start of President Trump's second term. The NLRB is a small independent agency that investigates unfair labor practice complaints.

🎧 The whistleblower, Daniel Berulis, says that DOGE requested the highest-level access when they arrived. After that, he saw a big spike in data leaving the agency. Berulis tells NPR's Jenna McLaughlin that security monitoring tools were cut off and records were deleted. Some ongoing NLRB cases involve Musk's companies, which has worried legal experts. Musk has said he would recuse himself from anything involving his companies. If he obtained access to NLRB information, it could give him a leg up in court. McLaughlin says there have been over a dozen work cases of government witnesses outlining DOGE's mishandling of sensitive data at agencies like the Treasury Department and the IRS.

The Trump administration yesterday froze over $2.2 billion in multiyear grants and contracts to Harvard University. The move came quickly after Harvard President Alan Garber wrote a letter to faculty rejecting the administration's demands to eliminate DEI programs, screen international students who are ""supportive of terrorism or anti-Semitism,"" ensure ""viewpoint diversity"" in hiring and more. Garber stated that most of the demands were trying to regulate intellectual conditions at the institution and threaten free speech.



🎧 On Up First, NPR's Jonaki Mehta emphasized a portion of Garber's letter that said the government's ""retreat from these partnerships now risks not only the health and well-being of individuals, but also the economic security and vitality of our nation."" Mehta says much of the money that has been frozen goes towards research and helps pay for innovations in engineering and medicine. The administration has threatened billions of dollars of funding for other universities, and some have said they would cooperate with demands.

El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele said yesterday that he has no plans to release Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to the U.S. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen who lived in Maryland for around 15 years, was deported to El Salvador despite being granted protections by a U.S. immigration judge. During Bukele's Oval Office visit, Trump and his team said it was up to the Salvadoran government to decide whether to return him.

ACLU's attorney Lee Gelernt tells Ordoñez that the case goes beyond one person and could have big implications on all other cases. Gelernt argues the U.S. shouldn't be using a system where people don't have due process, especially if it isn't willing to correct its mistakes.

The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act has passed the House and is now headed to the Senate. Lawmakers introduced the SAVE Act, which aims to implement significant reforms in voter registration, in response to concerns about voter fraud. The bill requires individuals to provide proof of U.S. citizenship, including acceptable documents such as a birth certificate, U.S. passport, naturalization paperwork, and specific versions of the Real ID, before they can register to vote. Here's why some lawmakers argue the Act could make it harder for married women to vote:



🗳️ Approximately 69 million American women have adopted their spouse's last name. This means their birth certificates don't match their current names. Meanwhile, more than half of all Americans don't have a passport.

🗳️ Legal experts told NPR that states could simplify the process by accepting secondary documents like a name change decree or marriage certificate, though this may not help all married individuals. Marriage certificates are more common than court decrees but some women may no longer have one readily available.

🗳️ The bill's ambiguity could lead to uneven policies across the country, meaning some states and municipalities will enforce stricter document requirements than others.

For years, the U.S. Justice Department has worked to unravel a global hacking campaign that targeted prominent American climate activists. Now, public tax filings reviewed by NPR reveal an unexpected link between the company that allegedly commissioned the attacks and some of the victims.

The connection emerges as another element in the complex story of how hackers were allegedly hired to attack parts of American civil society. The Justice Department investigation has focused recently on an Israeli private investigator named Amit Forlit whom federal prosecutors are trying to extradite from the United Kingdom for allegedly orchestrating the hacking. Prosecutors say the operation was aimed at gathering information to foil lawsuits against the fossil fuel industry over damage communities have faced from climate change.

Sponsor Message

Buried in the investigation's court filings are the names of one of the world's biggest publicly-traded oil companies and one of its longtime lobbyists: ExxonMobil and DCI Group. In an affidavit filed in the UK, a federal prosecutor identifies DCI as the firm that allegedly commissioned the hacking.

DCI was working for ExxonMobil when the attacks allegedly started around early 2016, according to federal lobbying records and Justice Department legal filings. At the same time, DCI was also consulting for New Venture Fund, a nonprofit known for working on progressive causes, including reducing the use of fossil fuels, according to tax filings NPR reviewed. During that period when DCI worked for both ExxonMobil and New Venture Fund, a senior advisor at the nonprofit was working with climate activists targeted by the alleged hacking operation.

Legal experts and researchers who track Washington's influence industry told NPR the relationship between DCI and New Venture Fund raises questions about what role that connection might have played in the alleged targeting of climate activists. Analysts at The Citizen Lab, a cyber watchdog at the University of Toronto, said in a report about the attacks that they were carefully tailored, suggesting hackers had a ""highly detailed and accurate understanding"" of the climate activists and their relationships.

Sponsor Message

""What you have unearthed is certainly a step investigators would want to look at,"" Barbara McQuade, a law professor at the University of Michigan and a former federal prosecutor, told NPR about the link between DCI and New Venture Fund.

In criminal cases, investigators map out relationships between individuals and organizations using things like financial transactions, phone records and tax filings, McQuade says. ""When you layer them along with dates, sometimes you can find interesting patterns,"" she says.

The Justice Department didn't respond to a message seeking comment.

A DCI executive, Craig Stevens, declined to comment. Stevens previously told NPR that no one at the firm has been questioned by the U.S. government as part of the hacking investigation. ""Allegations of DCI's involvement with hacking supposedly occurring nearly a decade ago are false and unsubstantiated. We direct all our employees and consultants to comply with the law,"" Stevens said. ""Meanwhile, radical anti-oil activists and their donors are peddling conspiracy theories to distract from their own anti-U.S. energy activities.""

ExxonMobil referred to a previous statement in which the company told NPR it has not been ""involved in, nor are we aware of, any hacking activities. If there was any hacking involved, we condemn it in the strongest possible terms."" The company has said it has repeatedly acknowledged ""climate change is real, and we have an entire business dedicated to reducing emissions.""

New Venture Fund President Lee Bodner told NPR that DCI worked on a project housed at the nonprofit that promoted education reform and Common Core state education standards with Republicans. Bodner says DCI wouldn't have had access to New Venture Fund's internal computer systems.

Hacking victim says the attacks felt like 'Big Brother had arrived'

The hacking operation against climate activists fits a widespread pattern in which companies and wealthy individuals use private investigators to conduct cyberespionage against opponents, often to discredit them in legal disputes.

Sponsor Message

As part of the Justice Department's long-running investigation into the hacking, an Israeli private investigator named Aviram Azari was sentenced to prison in the U.S. in late 2023 after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit computer hacking, wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Azari hired hackers who targeted American climate activists, as well as government officials in Africa, members of a Mexican political party and critics of a German company called Wirecard, according to federal prosecutors.

In a sentencing memo for Azari, prosecutors singled out ExxonMobil, saying the company used news stories based on information stolen from activists as part of its defense against state climate investigations. Prosecutors didn't accuse ExxonMobil or DCI of wrongdoing in that case.

""It felt like Big Brother had arrived,"" and ""citizens opposing powerful interests have their communications surveilled,"" Lee Wasserman, director of the Rockefeller Family Fund, said at Azari's 2023 sentencing hearing in Manhattan. Wasserman was among those targeted by the hacking.

Months later, in early 2024, Amit Forlit, a business associate of Azari's, was arrested under an Interpol Red Notice at London's Heathrow airport on his way to Tel Aviv. The Justice Department has charged Forlit with conspiracy to commit computer hacking, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud. Forlit has previously denied ordering or paying for hacking.

A former officer in Israel's internal security service, Shin Bet, Forlit said in a sworn statement after his arrest that he owns a security and intelligence-gathering firm whose clients include law firms, lobbyists and hedge funds. Another hearing in Forlit's extradition case is scheduled for April 17 in London.

A lawyer for Forlit said in a recent court filing that the hacking operation her client is accused of leading ""is alleged to have been commissioned by DCI Group, a lobbying firm representing ExxonMobil, one of the world's largest fossil fuel companies.""

The British judge overseeing Forlit's extradition case recently unsealed the U.S. indictment against him. In it, the names of the oil and gas company and the lobbying firm Forlit allegedly worked for are anonymized. Instead, the indictment refers to a ""public affairs, lobbying, and business consulting company, headquartered in Washington, D.C.,"" that allegedly hired Forlit to target environmental activists as part of its work for ""one of the world's largest oil and gas corporations, with headquarters in Irving, Texas.""

About halfway through the 30-page affidavit, the prosecutor cites emails in which ""DCI Group"" employees allegedly shared versions of a stolen memo belonging to an environmental lawyer, as well as information about people who received the memo.

NPR couldn't confirm that the Justice Department is referring to DCI every time the affidavit mentions the ""D.C. lobbying firm."" However, the Justice Department only cites one lobbying firm in the affidavit.

According to the affidavit, the ""D.C. lobbying firm"" started working with Forlit at least as far back as 2013.

In 2015, an executive at the D.C. lobbying firm allegedly approached Forlit about targeting environmental and climate advocates, according to the affidavit. The affidavit details how the Justice Department alleges the hacking operation worked:

The D.C. lobbying firm allegedly identified people and organizations it wanted to discredit as part of its work for the Texas oil company;

Forlit or a co-conspirator allegedly gave Azari lists of people or accounts that were of interest to the D.C. lobbying firm;

Azari then allegedly hired hackers to target the climate activists;

Later, the lobbying firm allegedly shared with the oil company private documents — or versions of documents — that were ""likely obtained through the successful hacking,"" according to the prosecutor's affidavit.

Soon after, the private documents appeared in media reports that were ""designed to undermine the integrity of the civil investigations"" into the oil company, the Justice Department alleges. The affidavit claims the oil company then ""relied on the published articles about the stolen and leaked documents"" in court filings to fight litigation.

DCI lobbied for ExxonMobil for about a decade, according to federal lobbying records . ExxonMobil was based in Irving, Texas , until mid-2023. Forlit's lawyer, Rachel Scott, said in a January court filing in London that the U.S. is trying to prosecute Forlit in part ""to advance the politically-motivated cause of pursuing ExxonMobil.""

ExxonMobil and other fossil-fuel companies face dozens of climate lawsuits filed by states and localities for allegedly misleading the public for decades about the dangers of burning fossil fuels, the primary cause of climate change. The lawsuits seek money to help communities cope with the risks and damages from global warming, including more extreme storms, floods and heat waves. The U.S. government is not part of the litigation. The fossil fuel industry says the lawsuits are meritless and politicized, and that climate change is an issue that should be dealt with by Congress, not the courts.

A private meeting among climate activists gets exposed in the press

In the affidavit, the Justice Department said the first example of alleged hacking of documents and leaking to the media came in 2016.

Early that year, Kenny Bruno, an environmental advocate, emailed an agenda for a closed-door strategy meeting to a group of climate activists. They planned to gather at the Manhattan office of the Rockefeller Family Fund, a philanthropy that supports initiatives to address climate change, inequality and threats to democracy. At the time, the fossil-fuel industry was under growing pressure as Democratic politicians urged the Justice Department to investigate whether ExxonMobil had misled the public about climate change. Climate activists were to meet at the Rockefeller office to hone their attacks on the company, according to the meeting agenda .

When Bruno emailed the agenda in January 2016, he and DCI were both working with the non-profit New Venture Fund, NPR has found in tax filings and documents related to the U.S. hacking investigation. The prosecutor's affidavit says that about a month after Bruno sent the email, around February 2016, an executive at the D.C. lobbying firm gave copies of the email to the firm's client, the unnamed Texas oil company.

NPR hasn't been able to find any evidence of how the D.C. lobbying firm allegedly got copies of the email with the agenda. Forlit's team was also asked around that time to dig up information about the activists who received Bruno's email, according to the Justice Department affidavit.

The agenda for the Rockefeller meeting then surfaced in media reports in April 2016. ExxonMobil and Republican lawmakers cited the document as they battled state climate investigations, saying activists and state prosecutors colluded to advance a political agenda.

Bruno says he didn't know DCI was a consultant for New Venture Fund at the same time he was there. He says he was working on a project housed at the nonprofit to limit oil production from Canadian tar sands . ""I had no interaction with them,"" he says.

""If DCI was involved, they wouldn't have [had] access through their work with New Venture Fund,"" says Bodner, the nonprofit's president. Bodner adds: ""Our [computer] systems didn't house that kind of sensitive project communication that would have been of most interest to the hackers.""

As a so-called fiscal sponsor , New Venture Fund provides administrative, legal and accounting support for the projects that it hosts. New Venture Fund was the fiscal sponsor for the projects that Bruno and DCI, respectively, were working on when climate activists were targeted by hackers.

The leak of the Rockefeller agenda wasn't the only time private communications between environmental advocates appeared in the media in an apparent effort to shape public opinion.

In another example cited by the Justice Department, the D.C. lobbying firm allegedly obtained a private memo belonging to an environmental lawyer as early as March 2016. Around that time, an executive at the lobbying firm gave a copy of the document to the oil company, according to the prosecutor's affidavit.

It's in this portion of the affidavit where the anonymization of the D.C. lobbying firm lapses. The affidavit states that a version of the private memo was then emailed between ""DCI Group"" employees shortly before it was published in a news report in 2017. On the day the article was published, an executive at the D.C. lobbying firm emailed it to colleagues, the prosecutor's affidavit against Forlit alleges. The subject line of the email was ""BOOM.""

When the FBI interviewed Forlit a few years later, in the U.S. Embassy in London in 2021, they discussed his ""connections with DCI,"" Forlit said in a sworn statement that was filed as part of his extradition case.

Kert Davies, director of special investigations at the Center for Climate Integrity and a target of the hacking, says DCI was instrumental in public relations work that helped ExxonMobil and others in the fossil-fuel industry fight efforts to cut heat-trapping emissions while politicizing the issue of climate change among voters.

The industry ""sought division and debate to slow the policy wheel from turning,"" Davies says.

DCI executive said the firm is hired 'when the stakes are the highest'

Analysts at The Citizen Lab, the cyber watchdog group, said in a report several years ago that the attacks on climate activists were ""well-informed."" Hackers targeted campaigners and their family members with what are known as ""phishing emails,"" which are used to gain access to sensitive information through impersonation or other deceptive means. Some of the messages seemed to refer to confidential documents related to ExxonMobil, The Citizen Lab said, while others impersonated people who were involved in lawsuits against the oil company.

That suggests hackers ""had a deep knowledge of informal organizational hierarchies"" among the climate activists, The Citizen Lab said. ""Some of this knowledge would likely have been hard to obtain from [publicly-available information] alone.""

The Citizen Lab report didn't mention Forlit or DCI, and it didn't draw conclusions about who may have commissioned the hacking. NPR hasn't been able to find evidence that DCI obtained any non-public information about climate activists through its work with New Venture Fund.

DCI has longstanding ties to the fossil fuel industry. In the early 2000s, ExxonMobil provided funding for a website DCI published called Tech Central Station, which the Union of Concerned Scientists called a ""hybrid of quasi-journalism and lobbying."" And from 2005 until early 2016, ExxonMobil paid DCI around $3 million to lobby the federal government, according to lobbying disclosures. DCI has also worked for a nonprofit that supports the U.S. coal industry, and another that launched a campaign in 2017 to push back on climate lawsuits targeting the fossil fuel industry.

"Attack leaves at least 40 people dead in Nigeria, the country's president says","Attack leaves at least 40 people dead in Nigeria, the country's president says

toggle caption Greg Baker/AFP via AP

ABUJA, Nigeria — Nigeria's president said on Monday that at least 40 people were killed when Muslim gunmen, believed to be herders, attacked a Christian farming community in the north-central part of the country, the latest in an increasing wave of violence in the West African country.

President Bola Tinubu also said he has ordered an investigation over the late Sunday night attack on the Zike community, extending his condolences to the victims and their families.

""I have instructed security agencies to thoroughly investigate this crisis and identify those responsible for orchestrating these violent acts,"" Tinubu said in a statement late Monday.

Amnesty International said the victims, who included children and the elderly, were taken by surprise and could not flee from the gunmen.

Such attacks have become common in this part of Africa's most populous country, where gunmen — typically herders from Fulani, a Muslim tribe — exploit security lapses to launch deadly raids on farmers in a fight over land resources.

Sponsor Message

According to Andy Yakubu, a local resident, gunmen in Sunday night's attack also destroyed and looted homes in the Zike community, located in the Bassa area of Plateau state,

Yakubu said he saw bodies after the attack and that the number of dead could exceed 50. No one has been arrested so far, he added.

The Fulani have been accused of carrying out mass killings across the northwest and central regions, where the decades-long conflict over access to land and water has further worsened the divisions between farmers and herders, Christians and Muslims.

Amnesty says that between December 2023 and February 2024, 1,336 people were killed in Plateau state — an indication that the measures taken by Tinubu's administration to curb the violence are not working.

Samuel Jugo, spokesperson of the Irigwe Development Association, an ethnic organization in the Bassa area, said in a statement on Monday that at least 75 people of the Irigwe, a Christian ethnic group, have been killed since December 2024.

Jugo said that despite deployment of additional security forces to the area, violence still occurs and described the latest assault as ""very provocative, vexing and undeserving.""

In May 2024, armed men attacked remote villages in Plateau, killing at least 40 people during a late-night raid.

The violence over land resources in north-central Nigeria is separate from the battles with Boko Haram, Nigeria's homegrown jihadis who took up arms in 2009 to fight Western education and impose their radical version of Islamic law. That conflict, now Africa's longest struggle with militancy, has also spilled into Nigeria's northern neighbors.

Hungary passes constitutional amendment to ban LGBTQ+ public events,"Hungary passes constitutional amendment to ban LGBTQ+ public events

toggle caption Robert Hegedus/MTI via AP

BUDAPEST, Hungary — Hungary's parliament on Monday passed an amendment to the constitution that allows the government to ban public events by LGBTQ+ communities, a decision that legal scholars and critics call another step toward authoritarianism by the populist government.

The amendment, which required a two-thirds vote, passed along party lines with 140 votes for and 21 against. It was proposed by the ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition led by populist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

Ahead of the vote — the final step for the amendment — opposition politicians and other protesters attempted to blockade the entrance to a parliament parking garage. Police physically removed demonstrators, who had used zip ties to bind themselves together.

The amendment declares that children's rights to moral, physical and spiritual development supersede any right other than the right to life, including that to peacefully assemble. Hungary's contentious ""child protection"" legislation prohibits the ""depiction or promotion"" of homosexuality to minors aged under 18.

Sponsor Message

The amendment codifies a law fast-tracked through parliament in March that bans public events held by LGBTQ+ communities, including the popular Pride event in Budapest that draws thousands annually.

That law also allows authorities to use facial recognition tools to identify people who attend prohibited events — such as Budapest Pride — and can come with fines of up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($546).

Dávid Bedő, a lawmaker with the opposition Momentum party who participated in the attempted blockade, said before the vote that Orbán and Fidesz for the past 15 years ""have been dismantling democracy and the rule of law, and in the past two or three months, we see that this process has been sped up.""

He said as elections approach in 2026 and Orbán's party lags in the polls behind a popular new challenger from the opposition, ""they will do everything in their power to stay in power.""

Opposition lawmakers used air horns to disrupt the vote, which continued after a few moments.

Hungary's government has campaigned against LGBTQ+ communities in recent years, and argues its ""child protection"" policies, which forbid the availability to minors of any material that mentions homosexuality, are needed to protect children from what it calls ""woke ideology"" and ""gender madness.""

Critics say the measures do little to protect children and are being used to distract from more serious problems facing the country and mobilize Orbán's right-wing base ahead of elections.

Sponsor Message

""This whole endeavor which we see launched by the government, it has nothing to do with children's rights,"" said Dánel Döbrentey, a lawyer with the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, calling it ""pure propaganda.""

Constitution recognizes two sexes

The new amendment also states that the constitution recognizes two sexes, male and female, an expansion of an earlier amendment that prohibits same-sex adoption by stating that a mother is a woman and a father is a man.

The declaration provides a constitutional basis for denying the gender identities of transgender people, as well as ignoring the existence of intersex individuals who are born with sexual characteristics that do not align with binary conceptions of male and female.

In a statement on Monday, government spokesperson Zoltán Kovács wrote that the change is ""not an attack on individual self-expression, but a clarification that legal norms are based on biological reality.""

Döbrentey, the lawyer, said it was ""a clear message"" for transgender and intersex people: ""It is definitely and purely and strictly about humiliating people and excluding them, not just from the national community, but even from the community of human beings.""

The amendment is the 15th to Hungary's constitution since Orbán's party unilaterally authored and approved it in 2011.

Facial recognition to identify demonstrators

Ádám Remport, a lawyer with the HCLU, said that while Hungary has used facial recognition tools since 2015 to assist police in criminal investigations and finding missing persons, the recent law banning Pride allows the technology to be used in a much broader and problematic manner. That includes for monitoring and deterring political protests.

""One of the most fundamental problems is its invasiveness, just the sheer scale of the intrusion that happens when you apply mass surveillance to a crowd,"" Remport said.

""More salient in this case is the effect on the freedom of assembly, specifically the chilling effect that arises when people are scared to go out and show their political or ideological beliefs for fear of being persecuted,"" he added.

Suspension of citizenship

The amendment passed Monday also allows for Hungarians who hold dual citizenship in a non-European Economic Area country to have their citizenship suspended for up to 10 years if they are deemed to pose a threat to public order, public security or national security.

Hungary has taken steps in recent months to protect its national sovereignty from what it claims are foreign efforts to influence its politics or even topple Orbán's government.

The self-described ""illiberal"" leader has accelerated his longstanding efforts to crack down on critics such as media outlets and groups devoted to civil rights and anti-corruption, which he says have undermined Hungary's sovereignty by receiving financial assistance from international donors.

In a speech laden with conspiracy theories in March, Orbán compared people who work for such groups to insects, and pledged to ""eliminate the entire shadow army"" of foreign-funded ""politicians, judges, journalists, pseudo-NGOs and political activists.""

European regulations on chicken processing hamper U.S. exports,"European regulations on chicken processing hamper U.S. exports

As the U.S trade war heats up, President Trump has called for European countries to start buying our chicken and eggs. But food safety regulations put in place many years ago prohibit that from happening. Will Stone, reporter. Gisele Grayson, editor.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

President Trump wants countries to buy more American chicken. That's just one of the issues to surface in an escalating global trade war. NPR's Will Stone explains why.

WILL STONE, BYLINE: For decades, Europe has been at odds with the U.S. over chicken, and politicians overseas are not jumping at President Trump's challenge. Here's what Darren Jones, chief secretary to the U.K.'s Treasury, had to say recently during an interview on Sky News.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DARREN JONES: I think we can get a good deal on both sides.

UNIDENTIFIED COMMENTATOR: You can't have - you can't both have chlorinated chicken and not have chlorinated chicken.

JONES: And I've been really clear that we are not having chlorinated chicken in the U.K.

STONE: That's right - chlorinated chicken. It's become a sort of buzzword over the years. In the late '90s, the European Union placed a ban on poultry meat that had been rinsed with disinfectants, including chlorine. Using chlorine was once common in the U.S. for preventing sources of foodborne illness like salmonella and campylobacter. But it turns out times have changed.

DIANNA BOURASSA: The vast majority of chicken processed in the United States is not chilled in chlorine and hasn't been for quite a few years.

STONE: Dianna Bourassa is an applied poultry microbiologist at Auburn University. She says now poultry processors primarily use an organic acid, known as peroxyacetic or peracetic acid - basically a mixture of vinegar and hydrogen peroxide.

BOURASSA: It extends shelf life. It very significantly reduces the number of bacteria on chicken carcasses.

STONE: This has let the U.S. export poultry to other countries that prohibit chlorine, but not the EU and U.K. They don't allow any chemical washing. While it may be a perception issue for consumers, the chemicals themselves are not the primary concern. Regulators in Europe and the U.S. have concluded they don't pose a danger. Sarah Sorscher says it's more what those chemicals represent.

SARAH SORSCHER: Are these really a Band-Aid that's covering up some deeper issues with the food safety practices in the industry?

STONE: Sorscher is with the consumer advocacy group, the Center for Science in the Public Interest.

SORSCHER: Our hygiene practices are essentially - in their minds - inadequate.

STONE: And she thinks Europe has a point here.

SORSCHER: If U.S. producers really want to compete with Europe, they should think about elevating their food safety practices.

STONE: But others in this field disagree. Byron D. Chaves is a food microbiologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

BYRON D CHAVES: I would be very cautious about pushing that narrative.

STONE: He says, fundamentally, the regulations are different. Europe relies on preharvest interventions.

CHAVES: Preharvest means when the animal is still alive - things like vaccination and different types of additives that are used in feed.

STONE: The U.S., on the other hand, focuses more on interventions after the chicken is slaughtered. Chaves says it's difficult to compare the U.S. and Europe on foodborne illnesses linked to poultry because of differences in how the data are collected. His view?

CHAVES: The bottom line is that salmonella and campylobacter continue to be significant foodborne pathogens on both sides of the ocean.

STONE: Neither approach, he says, is 100% effective at eliminating this risk. Will Stone, NPR News.

El Salvador's Bukele says 'preposterous' to suggest he return Abrego Garcia to U.S.,"El Salvador's Bukele says 'preposterous' to suggest he return Abrego Garcia to U.S.

toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images

El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele said on Monday that he was not inclined to return Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to the United States.

Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen who had lived in Maryland for about 15 years, was deported to El Salvador despite being granted protections by an U.S. immigration judge. He is in custody in Bukele's mega prison known as CECOT. The Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return.

During Bukele's Oval Office visit on Monday, Trump and his team said it was up to the Salvadoran government to decide whether to return him. Bukele said he would not do that.

""The question is preposterous: how can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States?"" Bukele said.

Bukele has been a key ally to Trump as he ramps up deportations to the notorious Salvadoran prison. The Trump administration is paying the Salvadoran government $6 million to house migrants there.

The case involves the Alien Enemies Act

More than 200 migrants have been sent to the prison. Many have been sent there without due process using an obscure wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act to deport large groups of Venezuelans and Salvadorans who the administration says are gang members. Abrego Garcia's attorney says he is not a member of any gang.

While the Supreme Court ultimately ruled that the Trump administration could use the law — invoked during the War of 1812 and the two World Wars — to deport migrants, the high court also ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return.

Attorney General Pam Bondi, who was part of the Oval Office meeting with Bukele, said the administration's obligation only extended to providing a plane, but said that Abrego Garcia was now in Salvadoran custody.

She said that Abrego Garcia had not been in the United States legally and downplayed the issue with his deportation as a ""paperwork"" issue. ""That's up to El Salvador if they want to return him. That's not up to us,"" Bondi said.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said the matter was up to Bukele. ""He's a citizen of El Salvador, so it's very arrogant even for American media to suggest that we would even tell El Salvador, how to handle their own citizens,"" Miller said.

Rubio emphasized that no court in the United States had the right to conduct foreign policy.

""What we saw today at the White House should shock every American who cares about our system of checks and balances and the rule of law,"" said Vanessa Cárdenas, executive director of America's Voice, an immigration advocacy nonprofit, in a statement. She said the decision not to return Abrego Garcia violates the Supreme Court's ruling to bring him back.

""All of this is a reminder why immigration is the tip of the spear for Trump's larger assault on key pillars of our democracy and why what's at stake should alarm Americans of all political persuasions,"" she added.
