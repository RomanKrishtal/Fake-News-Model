You’re Not The Man I Married—You’re Significantly More Attractive And Loving,"Gerald, we need to talk. None of this is going to be easy for you to hear, but the simple fact is that you’ve changed. I’ve tried ignoring that feeling, to grin and bear it like a good wife would, but I just can’t pretend any longer: You’re not the man I married. You’re significantly more attractive and loving. You’re considerate, you’re responsible, and you’ve allowed your body to become really chiseled. In a word, you’re the total package.

To be honest, I don’t even recognize you anymore.

This isn’t what I signed up for. It’s been a long time since we stood at the altar and you scratched your nose and mumbled your vows while barely looking me in the eye. Back then, I thought I would be spending the rest of my life with the apathetic, incompetent man in front of me. I’ll never forget how leaden and bored you looked during our first dance and how, 45 seconds into the song, you bent down and whispered into my ear: “Was that good enough? Can I sit down now?” For years, all my friends and family members talked about was how off-putting you were.

These days, it’s like looking at a completely different person. You’re confident. You’re supportive. You know when to tuck in or not tuck in your shirt, and you ask me questions about my day. The other night, I walked through the front door and you surprised me with a shoulder rub and a pan-seared salmon dinner. I thought to myself: Who the hell is this man, and what has he done with my husband?

Is any of this getting through to you? Jesus, people respect you, Gerald. That’s not something I ever thought I’d have to say about my own husband. We need to face facts. You just aren’t who you once were. You’re now a caring partner, a healthy role model to our children, and an all-around interesting guy who cultivates several unique hobbies.

While I don’t want to be shallow, you’ve changed a lot physically, too. I’m not saying I expect you to look the same way you did at 22, but you’ve put on a lot of muscle. It’s like you can’t go a day without exercise. It may sound crazy, but I swear that your face has gotten more symmetrical lately.

Sometimes I look over at night and feel as if there’s a well-toned, courteous stranger in my bed.

Where is the man I fell in love with all those years ago? The man who breathed only through his mouth? The man who was covered head-to-toe in stains regardless of the last time he ate? The man who sent me into anaphylactic shock three times because he kept forgetting that his favorite snack, Reese’s Miniature Cups, had peanuts in them? That version of you—the ugly, bumbling idiot I was head over heels for—is completely gone.

Gerald, I am simply no longer in love with this improved version of you. That’s why I’m packing my bags and leaving tonight. Please don’t beg me to stay. I may not be perfect, but I do know my worth.",https://theonion.com/youre-not-the-man-i-married-youre-significantly-more-attractive-and-loving/,The Onion (Satire),0
Björk Performs Benefit Concert For Wilted Sunflowers In Mushroom Forest,"TOADSTOOL VALE—To aid ongoing recovery efforts in mystical lands recently devastated by a moonbeam, singer and composer Björk held a benefit concert Thursday in support of wilted sunflowers living in the mushroom forest. “This next song goes out to this enchanted mushroom forest and all the drooping sunflowers who were affected by the orb of night’s twilight rays,” said Björk, noting that all lily pads donated by concert attendees would go toward reviving the soil with glow worms and reinforcing the flowers’ stalks so they could one day grow high enough to reach the very star for which they were named. “It will take a lot more than a twinkle from a far away memory to dim your yellow petals. I hope this music can help bring all sugar sprites and pixies together to make this mushroom forest even more mesmerizing than before.” At press time, Björk was accused of selfishly taking advantage of the sunflowers by skimming thousands of donated dragonflies for her own personal use.",https://theonion.com/bjork-performs-benefit-concert-for-wilted-sunflowers-in-mushroom-forest/,The Onion (Satire),0
Salvadoran President Claims He Lacks Humanity To Return Wrongly Deported Man,"WASHINGTON—During a visit with President Donald Trump at the White House, El Salvador’s president Nayib Bukele claimed Monday that he “lacks the humanity” to return wrongly deported legal U.S. resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia back to America. “How can I return an innocent man to the United States when I don’t have the ability to feel empathy or compassion?” said Bukele, explaining that he’s consulted with his top advisors about the 29-year-old Maryland father being held in a Salvadoran prison, but none of them could find it in their hearts to care at all about the man’s situation. “Do you hear how ridiculous it sounds to expect that I could see myself reflected in another human being’s experience? Even if I wanted to, there’s no way I could acknowledge the plight of someone who is suffering because I am completely numb to the pain of others. My hands are tied because I’m totally dead inside.” At press time, President Trump had publicly thanked Bukele for his use of cruelty to project a facade of strength.",https://theonion.com/salvadoran-president-claims-he-lacks-humanity-to-return-wrongly-deported-man/,The Onion (Satire),0
Stephen A. Smith Hasn’t Ruled Out Living Cushy Life As Millionaire TV Personality With No Responsibilities,"NEW YORK—Insisting he was keeping all avenues open as he explored his future, ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith told reporters Monday that he still hasn’t ruled out living a cushy life as a millionaire television personality with no responsibilities. “Given the state of the country, I just feel like I have no choice but to seriously consider making $20 million or more annually while hundreds of thousands of viewers worship the ground I stand on,” said Smith, who confirmed he was huddling with close financial advisors to see how much his net worth might increase in the next four years. “People keep coming up to me, including my own pastor, and saying, ‘Steve, God has a plan for you to continue making incredible sums of money while podcasting out of your luxury apartment in Manhattan for a few hours every day.’ All I’m saying is that when people believe you’re the man to spend 2028 floating around in your private pool and eating Michelin-star meals without a care in the world, you need to take those beliefs seriously.” Smith added that he was on the verge of forming an exploratory committee to see how sweet his life could possibly get.",https://theonion.com/stephen-a-smith-hasnt-ruled-out-living-cushy-life-as-millionaire-tv-personality-with-no-responsibilities/,The Onion (Satire),0
Report: Wife Hasn’t Been Home In Few Days,"MEDINA, OH—Speculating that the situation could be worth looking into at some point down the line, a report released Friday found that local wife Casey Davis, 37, hadn’t been home in a few days. “Huh, that’s weird,” said Nick Davis, who was quoted in the report and who looked from a television playing a rerun of Chicago Fire to a window showing that his wife’s car was still not in the driveway after what must have been two or three days. “I’m pretty sure she usually comes home every day. But she’s definitely not here now, because I called out her name a few times and she didn’t answer. Guess I’ll order delivery again. She’d probably call if something was wrong, right?” The report concluded that it was no doubt best to give it a few more days before sending her a text.",https://theonion.com/report-wife-hasnt-been-home-in-few-days/,The Onion (Satire),0
Aaron Rodgers Goes On Ayahuasca Retreat In Search Of New Interview Anecdote,"EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ—In what the 41-year-old New York Jets quarterback described as a “transformative experience,” Aaron Rodgers confirmed Wednesday that he’d gone on an ayahuasca retreat in search of new interview anecdotes. “When I first did ayahuasca, I knew immediately that I’d found something that I could talk about for hours on all types of media platforms,” said Rodgers, who added that ingesting hallucinogens with the help of a shaman finally gave him the power, wisdom, and mental clarity to discuss his newfound drug use nonstop on podcasts, radio shows, and TV programs. “Before, I used to go into interviews and be unable to produce a single juicy sound bite, tidbit, or headline that would make me seem even remotely interesting to the general public. But since entering a maloca in Costa Rica and participating in the ceremony, I haven’t been able to shut up about it,” he said. “It’s been such an incredible journey, going deep inside my spirit to find more ways to talk about myself. When it comes to generating press, my third eye is truly open.” Rodgers went on to tell reporters that he would continue to make ayahuasca his entire personality for decades to come in order to avoid discussing the fact that he just helped the Jets miss the playoffs for the 14th-consecutive season.",https://theonion.com/aaron-rodgers-goes-on-ayahuasca-retreat-in-search-of-new-interview-anecdote/,The Onion (Satire),0
