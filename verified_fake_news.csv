Report: Wife Hasn’t Been Home In Few Days,"MEDINA, OH—Speculating that the situation could be worth looking into at some point down the line, a report released Friday found that local wife Casey Davis, 37, hadn’t been home in a few days. “Huh, that’s weird,” said Nick Davis, who was quoted in the report and who looked from a television playing a rerun of Chicago Fire to a window showing that his wife’s car was still not in the driveway after what must have been two or three days. “I’m pretty sure she usually comes home every day. But she’s definitely not here now, because I called out her name a few times and she didn’t answer. Guess I’ll order delivery again. She’d probably call if something was wrong, right?” The report concluded that it was no doubt best to give it a few more days before sending her a text.",https://theonion.com/report-wife-hasnt-been-home-in-few-days/,The Onion (Satire),0
Aaron Rodgers Goes On Ayahuasca Retreat In Search Of New Interview Anecdote,"EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ—In what the 41-year-old New York Jets quarterback described as a “transformative experience,” Aaron Rodgers confirmed Wednesday that he’d gone on an ayahuasca retreat in search of new interview anecdotes. “When I first did ayahuasca, I knew immediately that I’d found something that I could talk about for hours on all types of media platforms,” said Rodgers, who added that ingesting hallucinogens with the help of a shaman finally gave him the power, wisdom, and mental clarity to discuss his newfound drug use nonstop on podcasts, radio shows, and TV programs. “Before, I used to go into interviews and be unable to produce a single juicy sound bite, tidbit, or headline that would make me seem even remotely interesting to the general public. But since entering a maloca in Costa Rica and participating in the ceremony, I haven’t been able to shut up about it,” he said. “It’s been such an incredible journey, going deep inside my spirit to find more ways to talk about myself. When it comes to generating press, my third eye is truly open.” Rodgers went on to tell reporters that he would continue to make ayahuasca his entire personality for decades to come in order to avoid discussing the fact that he just helped the Jets miss the playoffs for the 14th-consecutive season.",https://theonion.com/aaron-rodgers-goes-on-ayahuasca-retreat-in-search-of-new-interview-anecdote/,The Onion (Satire),0
Tips For Decorating Easter Eggs,"From bold color choices to intricate patterns, there are many ways to make your springtime holiday decorations stand out from the rest. The Onion shares tips for dyeing Easter eggs.

Decide if you’ll be doing impressionism, pointillism, or a blue one.

Create a chromatic silver effect with a few tablespoons of liquid mercury.

Get the kids involved by letting them watch you do it so they don’t fuck it up.

Hush Falls Over Crowd After Bagel Tears ACL In Jumbotron Race,"CHICAGO—Thousands of horrified Bulls fans reportedly gasped and shuddered Tuesday when a cartoon bagel tore his ACL in the jumbotron race, a gruesome injury that caused a hush to fall over the crowd at the United Center. “Oh Jesus, Biggie Bagel just went down hard—I’m not sure he’ll ever compete in another Dunkin’ race after an injury like that,” said Bulls fan Fiona Dubois, who winced as she saw the writhing bagel clutch his leg and appeared distressed as the animated tears of cream cheese streamed down his face. “Wow, Cuppy Coffee just hurdled right over him. Didn’t even stop to help. What an asshole. Once a bagel tears their ACL, their career as a jumbotron mascot is effectively over. The gluten in that part of the body can never fully heal. They’ve gotta cancel the race out of respect now, right? I feel so sick I probably won’t be able to eat my free chocolate glazed even if Dashing Donut does end up winning.” According to reports, fans later knelt and prayed for the bagel as medical officials carried him away on a napkin.",https://theonion.com/hush-falls-over-crowd-after-bagel-tears-acl-in-jumbotron-race/,The Onion (Satire),0
